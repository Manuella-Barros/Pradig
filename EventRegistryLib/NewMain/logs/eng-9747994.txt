Although Vance didn't know Thiel at the time, over the next decade he would become Thiel's employee, friend and the recipient of his largesse. Thiel's millions paved the way for Vance to become a senator.\n\nThiel's talk was \"the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School\", Vance would write in a 2020 essay for The Lamp, a Catholic magazine. In Vance's telling, Thiel's talk of the failures of elite institutions and belief in Christianity made him reconsider his own faith and immediately make plans for a career outside of law - one that wound through the worlds of tech and venture capital before politics.\n\nWhile Vance is best known for the hardscrabble origin story he laid out in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, in the years following his graduation from Yale he developed extensive ties with Silicon Valley's investors and elites. His time as a venture capitalist, coupled with his status as a rags-to-riches media fixture, helped him make connections central to his political rise, as well as garner him influential supporters that pushed Trump to make him his vice presidential pick.\n\nFollowing a brief period of work in corporate law after he graduated Yale, Vance moved to San Francisco and got a job at Thiel's Mithril Capital venture firm in 2015. After Hillbilly Elegy became a bestseller in 2016 and brought him to national prominence, Vance joined the venture capital firm Revolution, founded by the former AOL CEO Steve Case.\n\nVance remained a part of the tech VC world after returning to Ohio and leaving Revolution in early 2020. He received financial backing from Thiel to co-found the venture firm Narya Capital - which, like Thiel's enterprises, was named after an object from The Lord of The Rings, this time a ring of power made for elves. Other prominent investors in Narya included Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO,and Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist, who announced his own support for Trump this past week. The stated goal of Vance's firm was to invest in early-stage startups in cities that Silicon Valley tended to overlook.\n\nNarya Capital in 2021 led a group of conservative investors, including Thiel, to put money into Rumble, the video streaming platform that positions itself as a less-moderated and more rightwing friendly version of YouTube. Vance's co-founder at Narya, Colin Greenspon, touted the investment as a challenge to big tech's hold on online services - a frequent conservative talking point during the backlash to content moderation around the pandemic and 2020 presidential election. It was also around this time that Thiel, who heavily backed Trump financially during the 2016 campaign, brought Vance to first talk with Trump during a secretive meeting at Mar-a-Lago in February of 2021, according to the New York Times.\n\nVance's long association with Thiel also proved lucrative during his run for senator in 2022. Thiel put a staggering $15m into Vance's campaign and, according to the Washington Post, helped court Trump's endorsement, leading to Vance winning a tightly contested Republican primary race and then the senate election.\n\nAlthough Thiel has pledged in recent years to stay out of donations to the 2024 election, Vance has since flexed his other Silicon Valley connections to ingratiate himself to Trump. The Ohio senator introduced David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist, to Donald Trump Jr in March, the New York Times reported, and attended Sacks' pro-Trump fundraiser in June, co-sponsored by Chamath Palihapitiya, Sacks' co-host on the popular podcast All In. The event, which cost as much as $300,000 to attend, was held at Sacks's San Francisco mansion and featured the investor thanking Vance for his help making the fundraiser happen. During an informal conversation at the dinner, Sacks and Palihapitiya told Trump to nominate Vance as his VP choice.\n\nSacks spoke at the Republican national convention Monday. In the days prior, he had also called Trump to advocate for Vance as the VP pick, as had Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson, the ex-Fox News host, according to Axios. Thiel also expressed his support for Vance in private calls with Trump, the New York Times reported. When Trump confirmed Vance would be his running mate, Sacks and Musk posted fawning celebrations on Twitter - with Musk saying the ticket \"resounds with victory\".\n\nMany of Vance's wealthy tech elite and venture capitalist supporters now appear to be preparing to offer even more tangible support. Investors including Musk, Andreessen and Thiel's co-founder in Palantir, Joe Lonsdale, are all reportedly planning to donate huge sums of money to back the Trump and Vance campaign.", "source":

Investors including Musk, Andreessen and Thiel's co-founder in Palantir, Joe Lonsdale, are all reportedly planning to donate huge sums of money to back the Trump and Vance campaign.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Thiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yale Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hillbilly Elegy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Trump_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Never Trump movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Case", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Andreessen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Schmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David O.

D. Vance and his background, beyond what Sundance wrote about him on the Conservative Treehouse and is posted here on TBP.\n\nWhile J.D. Vance has his own controversies, his close connection to billionaire Peter Thiel, who is poised to have unprecedented influence in a new Trump administration, should deeply unsettle every American who cares about freedom, privacy and reining in the surveillance state.\n\nAfter the recent revelation that Donald Trump had selected J.D. Vance as his Vice President, public attention not only turned toward Vance, but also to the billionaire Peter Thiel. Vance has been one of several prominent Thiel prot\u00e9g\u00e9s whose profile has risen in recent years, with other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the PayPal co-founder including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anduril's Palmer Luckey.\n\nRecent reports have also noted that Thiel first recruited Vance into his circle while Vance was still a student at Yale Law School. Shortly thereafter, Vance joined Thiel's investment firm Mithril Capital, where he worked for two years before joining Revolution Ventures. Vance played a major role in Revolution's \"Rise of the Rest\" seed fund whose major investors included Amazon's Jeff Bezos and the Walton family of WalMart, who boast long-standing deep ties to the Clinton family. Vance later launched his own venture capital firm Narya Capital in 2020, which was heavily funded by Thiel as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt, a major Democrat donor, has been the guiding hand behind the Biden administration's science and technology policy and has dominated the development of the AI policies of the US military and intelligence communities, largely through his leadership of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, the Schmidt-led NSCAI promoted policies like the end of private car ownership and in-person shopping in the United States to advance Americans' adoption of AI as supposed national security imperative in the lead-up to the Covid-era lockdowns. Both Schmidt and Thiel are key members of the steering committee of the controversial, closed-door and overtly globalist Bilderberg conference. Newsweek once called Schmidt and Thiel the two most influential figures at Bilderberg.\n\nThiel has donated heavily to Vance's political career, giving $15 million to Vance's successful Senate bid in the 2022 election cycle in what was then the largest donation ever given to one Senate candidate. Thiel also joined Vance, a former \"Never Trumper,\" on a visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago where Vance successfully won the former president's blessing. Thiel also connected Vance to other members of the so-called PayPal mafia, like David Sacks who donated $1 million to Vance and hosted a fundraiser for him. Sacks, along with PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, were allegedly a key factor in Trump's selection of Vance as Vice President as they ran \"a secret lobbying campaign\" for Vance that also included media presenter Tucker Carlson.\n\nThiel had been a major donor to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and served on Trump's transition team, with other Thiel-linked figures like Trae Stephens dramatically influencing Trump's Pentagon appointments. Stephens' influence at the Trump Pentagon also helped develop the military's relationship with the Thiel-funded company Anduril, which was co-founded by Stephens and Thiel fellow Palmer Luckey. Before Anduril, Luckey develop the Virtual Reality system Oculus Rift, which was later sold to Facebook, where Thiel then served on the board. Anduril is now building a \"virtual border wall\" for the federal government and Trump, who long campaigned on building a physical barrier on the US-Mexico border, abandoned that promise during his first term and now supports the exact solution Anduril is selling.\n\nAnduril's unmanned drones have also come to play a major role in Ukrainian military operations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as have other controversial Thiel-funded companies like Palantir (a CIA contractor) and ClearView AI, which used mainly photos posted on Facebook (another Thiel-backed company) to develop its Orwellian facial recognition database. These companies' close ties to the Ukrainian military may impact a second Trump administration's policies as it relates to American support for Ukraine, particularly if Thiel is slated to hold significant influence. Beyond Ukraine, this network of Thiel-funded defense companies are remaking the face of warfare and slowly but surely replacing human decision-making with AI.\n\nWhile these ties should be unsettling on their own, the potential influence of Thiel on the upcoming Trump administration should concern every American, regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, due to Thiel's efforts to rehabilitate and remake some of the intelligence communities' most Orwellian and unconstitutional efforts to target domestic dissent.\n\nWhile Peter Thiel has long marketed himself as a libertarian, his track record from PayPal on has revealed him to instead be an architect of the modern surveillance state and a successor to the neoconservative cabal that had once tried (but failed) to do the same. During PayPal's earliest days, Thiel and his colleagues went around to various government agencies, including intelligence agencies, to see how they could best tailor their product to win government support (and contracts) for their products and services. After leaving PayPal, Thiel would follow a similar path in creating another company, Palantir. Palantir is the engine on which the surveillance state runs and, soon after Vance was announced as Trump's Vice President, it was reported that Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale as well as Palantir itself were backing a Trump-Vance super PAC called America PAC.\n\nUnlimited Hangout has reported extensively on Thiel and Palantir for several years. As noted in past reports, the company was created to be the privatized version of a post-9/11 surveillance program that had been dreamt up by the Iran-Contra criminals responsible for the unconstitutional Main Core database. During the Reagan administration, the individuals at the heart of the Iran-Contra scandal developed a database called Main Core, which firmly placed the US national-security state on its current, tech-fuelled path for crushing dissent. A senior government official with a high-ranking security clearance and service in five presidential administrations told Radar in 2008 that Main Core was \"a database of Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic might be incarcerated. The database can identify and locate perceived 'enemies of the state' almost instantaneously.\"\n\nMain Core was expressly developed for use in \"continuity of government\" (COG) protocols by the key Iran-Contra figure Oliver North and his allies that operated an \"off the books\" intelligence apparatus with direct CIA involvement known as \"The Enterprise.\" North and his associates used COG and Main Core to compile a list of US dissidents and \"potential troublemakers\" to be dealt with if the continuity of government protocol was ever invoked. Troublingly, these protocols could be invoked for a variety of reasons, including widespread public, non-violent opposition to a US military intervention abroad, widespread internal dissent, or a vaguely defined moment of \"national crisis\" or \"time of panic.\" North would later brush up against the Trump administration, joining former Blackwater founder Erik Prince in an effort to lobby the administration to create an \"off the books,\" private CIA.\n\nMain Core utilized the PROMIS software, which was stolen from its owners at Inslaw Inc. by top Reagan and US intelligence officials as well as Israeli spymaster Rafi Eitan. Also intimately involved in the PROMIS scandal was media baron and Israeli \"super spy\" Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell and reportedly the man who brought Jeffrey Epstein into the Israeli intelligence orbit. Like PROMIS, Main Core involved both US and Israeli intelligence and was a big data approach to the surveillance of perceived domestic dissidents.\n\nThe Iran-Contra and PROMIS scandals were exposed, but were subsequently covered up, largely by the then US attorney general William Barr, who would return to serve in that same position during the Trump administration. The use of Main Core by the federal government persisted and continued to amass data. That data could not be fully tapped into and utilized by the intelligence community until after the events of September 11, 2001, which offered a golden opportunity for the use of such tools against the domestic US population, all under the guise of combating \"terrorism.\" For example, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 government officials reportedly saw Main Core being accessed by White House computers.\n\nSeptember 11 was also used as an excuse to remove information \"firewalls\" within the national-security state, expanding \"information sharing\" among agency databases and, by extension, also expanding the amount of data that could be accessed and analyzed by Main Core and its analogues. As Alan Wade, then serving as the CIA's chief information officer, pointed out soon after 9/11: \"One of the post-September 11 themes is collaboration and information sharing. We're looking at tools that facilitate communication in ways that we don't have today.\"\n\nIn an attempt to build on these two post-9/11 objectives simultaneously, the US national-security state attempted to create a \"public-private\" surveillance program so invasive that Congress defunded it just months after its creation due to concerns it would completely eliminate the right to privacy in the US. Called Total Information Awareness (TIA), the program sought to develop an \"all-seeing\" surveillance apparatus managed by the Pentagon's DARPA. TIA's supporters argued that invasive surveillance of the entire US population was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks, bioterrorism events, and even naturally occurring disease outbreaks (such as pandemics) before they could take place.\n\nThe architect of TIA, and the man who led it during its relatively brief existence, was John Poindexter, best known for being Reagan's National Security Advisor during Iran-Contra and being convicted of five felonies in relation to that scandal. Poindexter, during the Iran-Contra hearings, had famously claimed that it was his duty to withhold information from Congress.\n\nIn regard to TIA, one of Poindexter's key allies was the chief information officer of the CIA, Alan Wade. Wade met with Poindexter in relation to TIA numerous times and managed the participation of not just the CIA but all US intelligence agencies that had signed on to add their data as \"nodes\" to TIA and, in exchange, gained access to its tools. Wade, while at the CIA, had previously partnered with Robert Maxwell's daughter, Christine Maxwell, on national security software called Chiliad, which had similarities to TIA (as well as Palantir) but fell short of the proposed program's scope and ambition. Christine had previously been involved in her father's efforts to market bugged PROMIS software to US national laboratories.\n\nThe TIA program, despite the best efforts of Poindexter and his allies such as Wade, was eventually forced to shut down after considerable criticism and public outrage. Though the program was defunded, it later emerged that TIA was never actually shut down, with its various programs having been covertly divided among the web of military and intelligence agencies that make up the US national security state. While some of those TIA programs went underground, the core panopticon software that TIA had hoped to wield began to be developed by the company now known as Palantir, with considerable help from the CIA and Alan Wade, as well as Poindexter.\n\nAt the time it was formally launched in February 2003, the TIA program was immediately controversial, leading it to change its name in May 2003 to Terrorism Information Awareness in an apparent attempt to sound less like an all-encompassing domestic surveillance system and more like a tool specifically aimed at \"terrorists.\" The TIA program was shuttered by the end of 2003.\n\nThe same month as the TIA name change Peter Thiel incorporated Palantir. Thiel, however, had begun creating the software behind Palantir months in advance, though he claims he can't recall exactly when. Some reports state that Palantir began as an anti-fraud algorithm at Thiel's PayPal. Thiel, Karp, and other Palantir cofounders claimed for years that the company had been founded in 2004, despite the paperwork of Palantir's incorporation by Thiel directly contradicting this claim.\n\nAlso, in 2003, apparently soon after Thiel formally created Palantir, Iraq War architect and Bush-era neoconservative Richard Perle called Poindexter, saying that he wanted to introduce the architect of TIA to two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp. According to a report in New York Magazine, Poindexter \"was precisely the person\" whom Thiel and Karp wanted to meet, mainly because \"their new company was similar in ambition to what Poindexter had tried to create at the Pentagon,\" that is, TIA. During that meeting, Thiel and Karp sought \"to pick the brain of the man now widely viewed as the godfather of modern surveillance,\" shaping Palantir into a TIA equivalent.\n\nSoon after Palantir's incorporation, though the exact timing and details of the investment remain hidden from the public, the CIA's In-Q-Tel became the company's first backer, aside from Thiel himself, giving it an estimated $2 million. In-Q-Tel's stake in Palantir would not be publicly reported until mid-2006. In addition, Alex Karp recently told the New York Times that \"the real value of the In-Q-Tel investment was that it gave Palantir access to the CIA analysts who were its intended clients.\" A key figure in the making of In-Q-Tel investments during this period, including Palantir, was the CIA's chief information officer at the time, Alan Wade.\n\nAfter the In-Q-Tel investment, the CIA held the unique position of being Palantir's only client until 2008. During that period, Palantir's two top engineers -- Aki Jain and Stephen Cohen -- traveled to CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia every two weeks. Jain recalls making at least two hundred trips to CIA headquarters between 2005 and 2009. During those regular visits, CIA analysts \"would test [Palantir's software] out and offer feedback, and then Cohen and Jain would fly back to California to tweak it.\" As with In-Q-Tel's decision to invest in Palantir, the CIA's chief information officer at the time, Alan Wade, played a key role in many of these meetings and subsequently in the \"tweaking\" of Palantir's products. It should come as no surprise, then, that there is an overlap between Palantir's products and the vision that Wade and Poindexter had held for the failed TIA program. The extensive overlap between the two is detailed in previous Unlimited Hangout investigations.\n\nThe benefits in repurposing the \"public-private\" TIA into a completely private entity after TIA was publicly dismantled are obvious. For instance, given that Palantir is a private company as opposed to a government program, the way its software is used by its government and corporate clients benefits from \"plausible deniability\" and frees Palantir and its software from constraints that would be present if it had remained a public project.\n\nA 2020 New York Times profile on Palantir noted:\n\nThe data, which is stored in various cloud services or on clients' premises, is controlled by the customer, and Palantir says it does not police the use of its products. Nor are the privacy controls foolproof; it is up to the customers to decide who gets to see what and how vigilant they wish to be.\n\nNot long after Thiel helped resurrect TIA as Palantir, another post-9/11 DARPA program was also seeking a private sector makeover. Developed by Douglas Gage, a close friend of Poindexter's and a DARPA program manager, LifeLog sought to \"build a database tracking a person's entire existence\" that included an individual's relationships and communications (phone calls, mail, etc.), their media-consumption habits, their purchases, and much more in order to build a digital record of \"everything an individual says, sees, or does.\" LifeLog would then take this unstructured data and organize it into \"discreet episodes\" or snapshots while also \"mapping out relationships, memories, events and experiences.\"\n\nLifeLog, per Gage and supporters of the program, would create a permanent and searchable electronic diary of a person's entire life, which DARPA argued could be used to create next-generation \"digital assistants\" and offer users a \"near-perfect digital memory.\" Gage insisted, even after the program was shut down, that individuals would have had \"complete control of their own data-collection efforts\" as they could \"decide when to turn the sensors on or off and decide who will share the data.\" In the years since then, analogous promises of user control have been made by the tech giants of Silicon Valley, only to be broken repeatedly for profit and to feed the government's domestic-surveillance apparatus.\n\nThe information that LifeLog gleaned from an individual's every interaction with technology was to be combined with information obtained from a GPS transmitter that tracked and documented the person's location, audio-visual sensors that recorded what the person saw and said, as well as biomedical monitors that gauged the person's health. Like TIA, LifeLog was promoted by DARPA as potentially supporting \"medical research and the early detection of an emerging epidemic.\"\n\nCritics in mainstream media outlets and elsewhere were quick to point out that the program would inevitably be used to build profiles on dissidents as well as suspected terrorists. Combined with TIA's surveillance of individuals at multiple levels, LifeLog went farther by \"adding physical information (like how we feel) and media data (like what we read) to this transactional data.\" One critic, Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, warned at the time that the programs that DARPA was pursuing, including LifeLog, \"have obvious, easy paths to Homeland Security deployments.\"\n\nAt the time, DARPA publicly insisted that LifeLog and TIA were not connected, despite their obvious parallels, and that LifeLog would not be used for \"clandestine surveillance.\" However, DARPA's own documentation on LifeLog noted that the project \"will be able . . . to infer the user's routines, habits and relationships with other people, organizations, places and objects, and to exploit these patterns to ease its task,\" which acknowledged its potential use as a tool of mass surveillance.\n\nHowever, despite its proponents' best efforts, LifeLog was shuttered just like TIA. Given what had transpired with TIA, some suspected the program would continue under a different name. For example, Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation told VICE at the time of LifeLog's cancellation, that: \"It would not surprise me to learn that the government continued to fund research that pushed this area forward without calling it LifeLog.\" Along with its critics, one of the would-be researchers working on LifeLog, MIT's David Karger, was also certain that the DARPA project would continue in a repackaged form. He told Wired that \"I am sure such research will continue to be funded under some other title . . . I can't imagine DARPA 'dropping out' of a such a key research area.\" The answer to these speculations appears to lie with the company that launched the exact same day that LifeLog was shuttered by the Pentagon: Facebook.\n\nA few months into Facebook's launch, in June 2004, Facebook co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz brought Sean Parker onto Facebook's executive team. Parker, previously known for co-founding Napster, later connected Facebook with its first outside investor, Peter Thiel. As discussed, Thiel, at that time, in coordination with the CIA, was actively trying to resurrect at least one controversial DARPA program that had been dismantled the previous year. Notably, Sean Parker, who became Facebook's first president, also had a history with the CIA, which sought to recruit him at the age of sixteen soon after he had been busted by the FBI for hacking corporate and military databases. Thanks to Parker, in September 2004, Thiel formally acquired $500,000 worth of Facebook shares and was added its board. Parker maintained close ties to Facebook as well as to Thiel, with Parker being hired as a managing partner of Thiel's Founders Fund in 2006. Thiel left the Facebook board, which he had joined in 2005, in 2022 to focus on supporting \"Trump-aligned candidates,\" including J.D. Vance.\n\nThiel and Facebook co-founder Mosokvitz became involved outside of the social network long after Facebook's rise to prominence, with Thiel's Founder Fund becoming a significant investor in Moskovitz's company Asana in 2012. Thiel's longstanding symbiotic relationship with Facebook co-founders extends to his company Palantir, as the data that Facebook users make public invariably winds up in Palantir's databases and helps drive the surveillance engine Palantir runs for US police departments, the military, and the intelligence community. Facebook data also feeds another Thiel-backed company, Clearview AI.\n\nNotably, even LifeLog's architect, Douglas Gage, has publicly commented on Facebook's similarities to the program he had once hoped to lead. In 2015, He told VICE that \"Facebook is the real face of pseudo-LifeLog at this point.\" He tellingly added, \"We have ended up providing the same kind of detailed personal information to advertisers and data brokers and without arousing the kind of opposition that LifeLog provoked,\" precisely because it is now a private company and not a project housed at the Pentagon's DARPA.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Palantir enjoyed an even more privileged status than it had held under previous administrations, with Palantir gaining many new lucrative contracts, mainly with the military and intelligence, during Trump's first term. This was likely influenced by Thiel's presence on Trump's transition teams and the role of close Thiel associates in choosing key Pentagon appointees.\n\nNot only that, but the broader agenda behind Palantir - the decades-long effort to create a pre-crime, AI-powered surveillance system in the United States - also got significant boosts during Trump's first term. For instance, Trump's Attorney General William Barr quietly legalized pre-crime in the United States under the guise of detecting potential mass shooters before they commit any crime. The program, called DEEP, enables the DOJ and FBI to work with \"private sector partners\" to surveil people of interest that have committed no crime, but are \"mobilizing towards violence.\" At roughly the same time the program was announced, Barr was also pushing heavily for a government backdoor into consumer apps and devices, particularly those that utilize encryption. He also signed a data access agreement with then-UK Home Secretary Priti Patel that allowed both countries to \"demand electronic data on consumers from tech companies based in the other country without legal restrictions.\"\n\nAlso during the Trump administration, an Israeli intelligence-linked company called Carbyne911 began to be installed throughout the United States in emergency call centers and has since spread throughout the nation. Carbyne911 was heavily funded by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Trae Stephens sits on its advisory board alongside Michael Chertoff (head of DHS under George W. Bush) and Kirstjen Nielsen (head of DHS under Trump). Carbyne was also heavily funded by Jeffrey Epstein and Leslie Wexner and, for much of its early history, was closely associated with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, himself an intimate associate of Epstein.\n\nCarbyne911 and similar companies extract any and all data from consumer smartphones for merely making emergency calls and then use it to \"analyze the past and present behavior of their callers, react accordingly, and in time predict future patterns,\" with the ultimate goal of smart devices - such as \"smart\" street lamps - making emergency calls to the authorities, as opposed to human beings.\n\nData obtained from these software products, which are slated to be adopted nationwide as part of a new national \"next generation\" 911 system, are shared with the same law enforcement agencies now implementing the Barr-designed \"national disruption and early engagement program\" to target individuals flagged as potentially violent based on vague criteria. Combined with the \"domestic terror\" framework released during the Biden administration, the definition of \"domestic terrorists\" now encompasses those who oppose US government overreach and those who oppose any form of capitalism, including the World Economic Forum-favored \"stakeholder capitalism,\" and/or \"corporate globalization.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, during this same period, also mulled the creation of a new health-focused agency modeled after DARPA. The proposed \"HARPA\", which was promoted extensively to Trump by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka as well as Trump's close friend and former NBCUniversal president Bob Wright. HARPA's proposed flagship program - \"SAFE HOME\" (Stopping Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome Mental Extremes) - would use \"breakthrough technologies with high specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric violence,\" specifically \"advanced analytical tools based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\" The program would have cost an estimated $60 million over four years and would use data from Americans' social media accounts as well as \"Apple Watches, Fitbits, Amazon Echo and Google Home\" and other consumer electronic devices. The program would also collect information provided by health-care providers to identify who may be a \"threat.\"\n\nThough HARPA was not created under the Trump administration, Trump reportedly reacted \"very positively\" to the proposal and was \"sold on the concept.\" In addition, before the proposal was known publicly, Trump had called on Big Tech, and specifically social media to collaborate with the DOJ to create software that stops mass murders before they happen by detecting potential mass shooters before they can act. However, Trump ultimately passed on creating HARPA, which was ultimately created during the Biden administration as ARPA-H, underscoring the bipartisan nature of this agenda.\n\nDespite many Thiel-backed or Thiel-founded companies describing themselves as \"America First\" and as defenders of \"Western values,\" a closer examination of those companies suggests this is not the case. One lesser known example of this is Palantir's early role in developing a way for the US government to target Julian Assange, leaks-based journalism in the public interest, and what it called \"The WikiLeaks Threat.\" In looking at other Thiel-linked firms, it's quite clear that at least some are more than willing to target Americans on either side of the political divide on behalf of their biggest client, the so-called \"Deep State\" that Trump supporters revile. Take, for example, the Thiel-backed Clearview AI - which claims to now be able to identify every person in the world using its advanced facial recognition system. As Unlimited Hangout contributor Stavroula Pabst noted in a recent report:\n\nWhen asked in an NBC interview about Clearview AI's possible negative ramifications for society, the company's CEO, Hoan Ton-That, said '[a] lot of peoples' minds on facial recognition technology were changed around Jan. 6th, when the insurrection happened [at the United States Capitol Building]. It was very instrumental in being able to make identifications quickly.'\n\nAs its own CEO stated, Clearview AI was used extensively on January 6th and later boasted of its \"potential for identifying rioters at the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\" In a 2023 interview, New York Times reporter Kashmir Hill added that, not only was Clearview AI used at the Capitol that day, but also in the days and weeks that followed to identify alleged rioters:\n\nThe FBI had photos of all these people because many of them were filming themselves on social media and posting photos online, and they weren't wearing masks. And so many police departments started running their photos through Clearview AI to identify them.\n\nAfter the events of January 6, 2021, Clearview AI reported a 26 percent uptake of its services from law enforcement, having used its role in targeting Trump supporters as a sales pitch.\n\nClearview AI is not the only Thiel-linked company willing to target Trump's base, as Palantir's co-founder and current CEO Alex Karp is obsessed with his long-time fear that the \"far right\" is going to murder him for his ethnic background. That fear, per Karp, \"propels a lot of the decisions\" made at Palantir. \"I still can't believe I haven't been shot and pushed out the window,\" Karp told New York Times reporter Michael Steinberger in 2020. Steinberger added that \"if the far right came to power, [Karp] said, he would certainly be among its victims. 'Who's the first person who is going to get hung? You make a list, and I will show you who they get first. It's me. There's not a box I don't check.'\"\n\nThen, in 2023, Karp stated during an interview at the World Economic Forum annual meeting that \"We built PG [proprietary software], which single-handedly stopped the rise of the far-right in Europe.\" Given that the labels \"far right\" as well as \"far left\" are often misused to describe those on either side of the political spectrum that do not subscribe to or support official narratives, it's worth asking if the \"far right\" Karp claims to have stopped referred to people who actually deserve the label, or right-leaning populism, given populism of any flavor is a threat to Palantir's benefactors in the corporate world and in the US National Security community.\n\nIn addition, Trump supporters that did not subscribe to official narratives around Covid-19-era policies should be aware of Palantir's role in the Trump administration's Covid response and also in the Covid vaccination roll-out. During Covid, Palantir developed Tiberius, which was used by HHS to \"help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccine each state will receive\" and also to \"decide where every allocated dose will go - from local doctors' offices to large medical centers.\" Tiberius, and by extension Palantir, collected all the Covid-19 and healthcare data from US government agencies, local and state governments, pharmaceutical firms, vaccine manufacturers and companies contracted to act as vaccine distributers. Palantir was also provided Americans' sensitive health information by the Trump-era HHS as well as \"a wide range of demographic, employment and public health data sets\" in order to \"help identify high-priority populations\" to receive the vaccine first. During Covid, Palantir was also a member of the Covid-19 Health Coalition, whose other members included the CIA's In-Q-Tel, which was Palantir's first funder, as well as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\n\nPalantir also managed the HHS Protect database, a secretive database that hoarded (and still hoards) information related to the spread of Covid-19 gathered from \"more than 225 data sets, including demographic statistics, community-based tests, and a wide range of state-provided data.\" At the time, HHS Protect was criticized by several public health experts and epidemiologists, among others, because of the sudden decision by the Trump-era HHS to force US hospitals to provide all data on COVID-19 cases and patient information directly to HHS Protect and, thus, to Palantir. Hospitals were threatened with the loss of Medicare or Medicaid funding if they declined to regularly feed all of their COVID-19 patient data and test results into the HHS Protect database. Palantir declined to provide information on any safeguards it had in place to protect Americans' health data in any of its HHS-related programs, despite requests to do so from Senators and Congressmen. HHS Protect also later incorporated HHS Vision, an artificial intelligence-driven \"predictive\" component, which \"uses prewritten algorithms to simulate behaviors and forecast possible outcomes.\" Aspects of HHS Protect share remarkable similarities with the scrapped TIA sub-program known as \"Bio-surveillance.\"\n\nNot only that, but a long-time consultant to Palantir, Avril Haines, was a key fixture at the controversial pandemic \"simulation\" in late 2019 that was tied to previous, intelligence-linked biosecurity events like the 2001 anthrax attacks. Haines, a former CIA deputy director, worked very closely with her superior, John Brennan, at the CIA, including during the time Brennan illegally surveilled Trump associates during the 2016 election cycle and helped propagate and develop the \"Russiagate\" narrative, which Haines is now conveniently resurrecting. Haines, shortly after participating in Event 201, joined the Biden administration and has been serving as the administration's top intelligence official - the Director of National Intelligence - since Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nPalantir is also controversial among the America left for its role in using big data to facilitate ICE raids on migrants and its decision to pilot its \"predictive policing\", i.e. pre-crime, functionality in low-income, minority communities. Ultimately, Palantir - like many of the other military/intelligence contractors with close ties to Peter Thiel - is a tool of the National Security State, which has been ramping up its \"War on Domestic Terror\" apparatus that - per government documentation - will target dissent on both left and right and essentially anyone who attempts to stand, or even speak, against government overreach and criminality.\n\nWith Thiel, Palantir and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale now pumping millions into the Trump-Vance campaign after the recent VP announcement, it seems almost inevitable that Palantir and the other Thiel-linked military contractors will have even more influence in a second Trump administration than it did during his first term.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DARPA LifeLog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palmer Luckey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_(workflow_engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anduril (workflow engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Main Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Poindexter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palantir Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oliver North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\u2013Contra_affair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran\u2013Contra affair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In-Q-Tel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) prepared to accept the Republican Party's nomination to be Donald Trump's running mate, MSNBC's out host Rachel Maddow laid out the 39-year-old Ohioan's unusual path to power.\n\n\"Writing a memoir and otherwise being Peter Thiel's intern is not usually the way you get to be a vice presidential nominee,\" she observed.\n\nIt turns out Thiel, the gay conservative billionaire co-founder of Paypal, has been an integral part of practically everything about Vance's life and career, from his work in the tech sector to his conversion to Catholicism to his selection as Trump's running mate.\n\nStay ahead of the 2024 Election with our newsletter that covers candidates, issues, and perspectives that matter.\n\nVance first met Thiel after at a lecture the venture capitalist gave in 2011 while Vance was at Yale. It was \"the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School,\" Vance wrote in a 2020 essay for The Lamp, a Catholic magazine.\n\nIn the talk, Thiel detailed what he called the failures of elite institutions and his belief in Christianity, which led Vance to reconsider a career in law and pushed him into tech.\n\nVance landed his first job at biotech company Circuit Therapeutics in Silicon Valley at the recommendation of Thiel in 2013, according to The New York Times, and Thiel pitched Vance in 2016 for his role as a principal at Mithril Capital, a venture firm that Thiel co-founded.\n\nAround the same time, Thiel wrote a promotional blurb for Vance's memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which went on to become a best seller. The book recounted Vance's family history in Kentucky and Ohio and was a well-timed account of white working-class grievance as Donald Trump ran on an appeal to the same group.\n\nWhile Thiel came out as a Trump supporter, Vance didn't follow his patron's lead -- yet.\n\n\"My god what an idiot,\" Vance tweeted about Trump in October 2016.\n\nIn 2020, Vance founded his own venture firm, Narya Capital, with $120 million in funding from Thiel and other tech titans he'd connected Vance with. Thiel served on Narya's leadership advisory committee, and even the name of Vance's venture was inspired by Thiel: all of his companies' names are based on The Lord of the Rings books; Narya refers to a ring of power made for elves.\n\nIn July 2021, Vance made the leap to politics when he announced his campaign for the U.S. Senate representing Ohio. Thiel bankrolled the run with $15 million.\n\nAlong with the career switch, Vance changed his mind about Trump. Thiel brokered an endorsement, introducing his candidate to Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Like some others, J.D.

Vance has his own controversies, his close connection to billionaire Peter Thiel, who is poised to have unprecedented influence in a new Trump administration, should deeply unsettle every American who cares about freedom, privacy and reining in the surveillance state.\n\nAfter the recent revelation that Donald Trump had selected J.D. Vance as his Vice President, public attention not only turned toward Vance, but also to the billionaire Peter Thiel. Vance has been one of several prominent Thiel prot\u00e9g\u00e9s whose profile has risen in recent years, with other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the PayPal co-founder including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anduril's Palmer Luckey.\n\nRecent reports have also noted that Thiel first recruited Vance into his circle while Vance was still a student at Yale Law School. Shortly thereafter, Vance joined Thiel's investment firm Mithril Capital, where he worked for two years before joining Revolution Ventures. Vance played a major role in Revolution's \"Rise of the Rest\" seed fund whose major investors included Amazon's Jeff Bezos and the Walton family of WalMart, who boast long-standing deep ties to the Clinton family. Vance later launched his own venture capital firm Narya Capital in 2020, which was heavily funded by Thiel as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt, a major Democrat donor, has been the guiding hand behind the Biden administration's science and technology policy and has dominated the development of the AI policies of the US military and intelligence communities, largely through his leadership of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, the Schmidt-led NSCAI promoted policies like the end of private car ownership and in-person shopping in the United States to advance Americans' adoption of AI as supposed national security imperative in the lead-up to the Covid-era lockdowns.Both Schmidt and Thiel are key members of the steering committee of the controversial, closed-door and overtly globalist Bilderberg conference. Newsweek once called Schmidt and Thiel the two most influential figures at Bilderberg.\n\nThiel has donated heavily to Vance's political career, giving $15 million to Vance's successful Senate bid in the 2022 election cycle in what was then the largest donation ever given to one Senate candidate. Thiel also joined Vance, a former \"Never Trumper,\" on a visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago where Vance successfully won the former president's blessing. Thiel also connected Vance to other members of the so-called PayPal mafia, like David Sacks who donated $1 million to Vance and hosted a fundraiser for him. Sacks, along with PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, were allegedly a key factor in Trump's selection of Vance as Vice President as they ran \"a secret lobbying campaign\" for Vance that also included media presenter Tucker Carlson.\n\nThiel had been a major donor to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and served on Trump's transition team, with other Thiel-linked figures like Trae Stephens dramatically influencing Trump's Pentagon appointments. Stephens' influence at the Trump Pentagon also helped develop the military's relationship with the Thiel-funded company Anduril, which was co-founded by Stephens and Thiel fellow Palmer Luckey. Before Anduril, Luckey develop the Virual Reality system Oculus Rift, which was later sold to Facebook, where Thiel then served on the board. Anduril is now building a \"virtual border wall\" for the federal government and Trump, who long campaigned on building a physical barrier on the US-Mexico border, abandoned that promise during his first term and now supports the exact solution Anduril is selling.\n\nAnduril's unmanned drones have also come to play a major role in Ukrainian military operations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as have other controversial Thiel-funded companies like Palantir (a CIA contractor) and ClearView AI, which used mainly photos posted on Facebook (another Thiel-backed company) to develop its Orwellian facial recognition database. These companies' close ties to the Ukrainian military may impact a second Trump administration's policies as it relates to American support for Ukraine, particularly if Thiel is slated to hold significant influence. Beyond Ukraine, this network of Thiel-funded defense companies are remaking the face of warfare and slowly but surely replacing human decision-making with AI.\n\nWhile these ties should be unsettling on their own, the potential influence of Thiel on the upcoming Trump administration should concern every American, regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, due to Thiel's efforts to rehabilitate and remake some of the intelligence communities' most Orwellian and unconstitutional efforts to target domestic dissent.\n\nThiel Information Awareness\n\nWhile Peter Thiel has long marketed himself as a libertarian, his track record from PayPal on has revealed him to instead be an architect of the modern surveillance state and a successor to the neoconservative cabal that had once tried (but failed) to do the same. During PayPal's earliest days, Thiel and his colleagues went around to various government agencies, including intelligence agencies, to see how they could best tailor their product to win government support (and contracts) for their products and services. After leaving PayPal, Thiel would follow a similar path in creating another company, Palantir. Palantir is the engine on which the surveillance state runs and, soon after Vance was announced as Trump's Vice President, it was reported that Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale as well as Palantir itself were backing a Trump-Vance super PAC called America PAC.\n\nUnlimited Hangout has reported extensively on Thiel and Palantir for several years. As noted in past reports, the company was created to be the privatized version of a post-9/11 surveillance program that had been dreamt up by the Iran-Contra criminals responsible for the unconstitutional Main Core database. During the Reagan administration, the individuals at the heart of the Iran-Contra scandal developed a database called Main Core, which firmly placed the US national-security state on its current, tech-fuelled path for crushing dissent. A senior government official with a high-ranking security clearance and service in five presidential administrations told Radar in 2008 that Main Core was \"a database of Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic might be incarcerated. The database can identify and locate perceived 'enemies of the state' almost instantaneously.\"\n\nMain Core was expressly developed for use in \"continuity of government\" (COG) protocols by the key Iran-Contra figure Oliver North and his allies that operated an \"off the books\" intelligence apparatus with direct CIA involvement known as \"The Enterprise.\" North and his associates used COG and Main Core to compile a list of US dissidents and \"potential troublemakers\" to be dealt with if the continuity of government protocol was ever invoked. Troublingly, these protocols could be invoked for a variety of reasons, including widespread public, non-violent opposition to a US military intervention abroad, widespread internal dissent, or a vaguely defined moment of \"national crisis\" or \"time of panic.\" North would later brush up against the Trump administration, joining former Blackwater founder Erik Prince in an effort to lobby the administration to create an \"off the books,\" private CIA.\n\nMain Core utilized the PROMIS software, which was stolen from its owners at Inslaw Inc. by top Reagan and US intelligence officials as well as Israeli spymaster Rafi Eitan. Also intimately involved in the PROMIS scandal was media baron and Israeli \"super spy\" Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell and reportedly the man who brought Jeffrey Epstein into the Israeli intelligence orbit. Like PROMIS, Main Core involved both US and Israeli intelligence and was a big data approach to the surveillance of perceived domestic dissidents.\n\nThe Iran-Contra and PROMIS scandals were exposed, but were subsequently covered up, largely by the then US attorney general William Barr, who would return to serve in that same position during the Trump administration. The use of Main Core by the federal government persisted and continued to amass data. That data could not be fully tapped into and utilized by the intelligence community until after the events of September 11, 2001, which offered a golden opportunity for the use of such tools against the domestic US population, all under the guise of combating \"terrorism.\" For example, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 government officials reportedly saw Main Core being accessed by White House computers.\n\nSeptember 11 was also used as an excuse to remove information \"firewalls\" within the national-security state, expanding \"information sharing\" among agency databases and, by extension, also expanding the amount of data that could be accessed and analyzed by Main Core and its analogues. As Alan Wade, then serving as the CIA's chief information officer, pointed out soon after 9/11: \"One of the post-September 11 themes is collaboration and information sharing. We're looking at tools that facilitate communication in ways that we don't have today.\"\n\nIn an attempt to build on these two post-9/11 objectives simultaneously, the US national-security state attempted to create a \"public-private\" surveillance program so invasive that Congress defunded it just months after its creation due to concerns it would completely eliminate the right to privacy in the US. Called Total Information Awareness (TIA), the program sought to develop an \"all-seeing\" surveillance apparatus managed by the Pentagon's DARPA. TIA's supporters argued that invasive surveillance of the entire US population was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks, bioterrorism events, and even naturally occurring disease outbreaks (such as pandemics) before they could take place.\n\nThe architect of TIA, and the man who led it during its relatively brief existence, was John Poindexter, best known for being Reagan's National Security Advisor during Iran-Contra and being convicted of five felonies in relation to that scandal. Poindexter, during the Iran-Contra hearings, had famously claimed that it was his duty to withhold information from Congress.\n\nIn regard to TIA, one of Poindexter's key allies was the chief information officer of the CIA, Alan Wade. Wade met with Poindexter in relation to TIA numerous times and managed the participation of not just the CIA but all US intelligence agencies that had signed on to add their data as \"nodes\" to TIA and, in exchange, gained access to its tools. Wade, while at the CIA, had previously partnered with Robert Maxwell's daughter, Christine Maxwell, on national security software called Chiliad, which had similarities to TIA (as well as Palantir) but fell short of the proposed program's scope and ambition. Christine had previously been involved in her father's efforts to market bugged PROMIS software to US national laboratories.\n\nThe TIA program, despite the best efforts of Poindexter and his allies such as Wade, was eventually forced to shut down after considerable criticism and public outrage. Though the program was defunded, it later emerged that TIA was never actually shut down, with its various programs having been covertly divided among the web of military and intelligence agencies that make up the US national security state. While some of those TIA programs went underground, the core panopticon software that TIA had hoped to wield began to be developed by the company now known as Palantir, with considerable help from the CIA and Alan Wade, as well as Poindexter.\n\nAt the time it was formally launched in February 2003, the TIA program was immediately controversial, leading it to change its name in May 2003 to Terrorism Information Awareness in an apparent attempt to sound less like an all-encompassing domestic surveillance system and more like a tool specifically aimed at \"terrorists.\" The TIA program was shuttered by the end of 2003.\n\nThe same month as the TIA name change Peter Thiel incorporated Palantir. Thiel, however, had begun creating the software behind Palantir months in advance, though he claims he can't recall exactly when. Some reports state that Palantir began as an anti-fraud algorithm at Thiel's PayPal. Thiel, Karp, and other Palantir cofounders claimed for years that the company had been founded in 2004, despite the paperwork of Palantir's incorporation by Thiel directly contradicting this claim.\n\nAlso, in 2003, apparently soon after Thiel formally created Palantir, Iraq War architect and Bush-era neoconservative Richard Perle called Poindexter, saying that he wanted to introduce the architect of TIA to two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp. According to a report in New York Magazine, Poindexter \"was precisely the person\" whom Thiel and Karp wanted to meet, mainly because \"their new company was similar in ambition to what Poindexter had tried to create at the Pentagon,\" that is, TIA. During that meeting, Thiel and Karp sought \"to pick the brain of the man now widely viewed as the godfather of modern surveillance,\" shaping Palantir into a TIA equivalent.\n\nSoon after Palantir's incorporation, though the exact timing and details of the investment remain hidden from the public, the CIA's In-Q-Tel became the company's first backer, aside from Thiel himself, giving it an estimated $2 million. In-Q-Tel's stake in Palantir would not be publicly reported until mid-2006. In addition, Alex Karp recently told the New York Times that \"the real value of the In-Q-Tel investment was that it gave Palantir access to the CIA analysts who were its intended clients.\" A key figure in the making of In-Q-Tel investments during this period, including Palantir, was the CIA's chief information officer at the time, Alan Wade.\n\nAfter the In-Q-Tel investment, the CIA held the unique position of being Palantir's only client until 2008. During that period, Palantir's two top engineers -- Aki Jain and Stephen Cohen -- traveled to CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia every two weeks. Jain recalls making at least two hundred trips to CIA headquarters between 2005 and 2009. During those regular visits, CIA analysts \"would test [Palantir's software] out and offer feedback, and then Cohen and Jain would fly back to California to tweak it.\" As with In-Q-Tel's decision to invest in Palantir, the CIA's chief information officer at the time, Alan Wade, played a key role in many of these meetings and subsequently in the \"tweaking\" of Palantir's products. It should come as no surprise, then, that there is an overlap between Palantir's products and the vision that Wade and Poindexter had held for the failed TIA program. The extensive overlap between the two is detailed in previous Unlimited Hangout investigations.\n\nThe benefits in repurposing the \"public-private\" TIA into a completely private entity after TIA was publicly dismantled are obvious. For instance, given that Palantir is a private company as opposed to a government program, the way its software is used by its government and corporate clients benefits from \"plausible deniability\" and frees Palantir and its software from constraints that would be present if it had remained a public project.\n\nA 2020 New York Times profile on Palantir noted:\n\nThe data, which is stored in various cloud services or on clients' premises, is controlled by the customer, and Palantir says it does not police the use of its products. Nor are the privacy controls foolproof; it is up to the customers to decide who gets to see what and how vigilant they wish to be.\n\nThe Social Media Panopticon\n\nNot long after Thiel helped resurrect TIA as Palantir, another post-9/11 DARPA program was also seeking a private sector makeover. Developed by Douglas Gage, a close friend of Poindexter's and a DARPA program manager, LifeLog sought to \"build a database tracking a person's entire existence\" that included an individual's relationships and communications (phone calls, mail, etc.), their media-consumption habits, their purchases, and much more in order to build a digital record of \"everything an individual says, sees, or does.\" LifeLog would then take this unstructured data and organize it into \"discreet episodes\" or snapshots while also \"mapping out relationships, memories, events and experiences.\"\n\nLifeLog, per Gage and supporters of the program, would create a permanent and searchable electronic diary of a person's entire life, which DARPA argued could be used to create next-generation \"digital assistants\" and offer users a \"near-perfect digital memory.\" Gage insisted, even after the program was shut down, that individuals would have had \"complete control of their own data-collection efforts\" as they could \"decide when to turn the sensors on or off and decide who will share the data.\" In the years since then, analogous promises of user control have been made by the tech giants of Silicon Valley, only to be broken repeatedly for profit and to feed the government's domestic-surveillance apparatus.\n\nThe information that LifeLog gleaned from an individual's every interaction with technology was to be combined with information obtained from a GPS transmitter that tracked and documented the person's location, audio-visual sensors that recorded what the person saw and said, as well as biomedical monitors that gauged the person's health. Like TIA, LifeLog was promoted by DARPA as potentially supporting \"medical research and the early detection of an emerging epidemic.\"\n\nCritics in mainstream media outlets and elsewhere were quick to point out that the program would inevitably be used to build profiles on dissidents as well as suspected terrorists. Combined with TIA's surveillance of individuals at multiple levels, LifeLog went farther by \"adding physical information (like how we feel) and media data (like what we read) to this transactional data.\" One critic, Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, warned at the time that the programs that DARPA was pursuing, including LifeLog, \"have obvious, easy paths to Homeland Security deployments.\"\n\nAt the time, DARPA publicly insisted that LifeLog and TIA were not connected, despite their obvious parallels, and that LifeLog would not be used for \"clandestine surveillance.\" However, DARPA's own documentation on LifeLog noted that the project \"will be able . . . to infer the user's routines, habits and relationships with other people, organizations, places and objects, and to exploit these patterns to ease its task,\" which acknowledged its potential use as a tool of mass surveillance.\n\nHowever, despite its proponents' best efforts, LifeLog was shuttered just like TIA. Given what had transpired with TIA, some suspected the program would continue under a different name. For example, Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation told VICE at the time of LifeLog's cancellation, that: \"It would not surprise me to learn that the government continued to fund research that pushed this area forward without calling it LifeLog.\" Along with its critics, one of the would-be researchers working on LifeLog, MIT's David Karger, was also certain that the DARPA project would continue in a repackaged form. He told Wired that \"I am sure such research will continue to be funded under some other title . . . I can't imagine DARPA 'dropping out' of a such a key research area.\" The answer to these speculations appears to lie with the company that launched the exact same day that LifeLog was shuttered by the Pentagon: Facebook.\n\nA few months into Facebook's launch, in June 2004, Facebook co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz brought Sean Parker onto Facebook's executive team. Parker, previously known for co-founding Napster, later connected Facebook with its first outside investor, Peter Thiel. As discussed, Thiel, at that time, in coordination with the CIA, was actively trying to resurrect at least one controversial DARPA program that had been dismantled the previous year. Notably, Sean Parker, who became Facebook's first president, also had a history with the CIA, which sought to recruit him at the age of sixteen soon after he had been busted by the FBI for hacking corporate and military databases. Thanks to Parker, in September 2004, Thiel formally acquired $500,000 worth of Facebook shares and was added its board. Parker maintained close ties to Facebook as well as to Thiel, with Parker being hired as a managing partner of Thiel's Founders Fund in 2006. Thiel left the Facebook board, which he had joined in 2005, in 2022 to focus on supporting \"Trump-aligned candidates,\" including J.D. Vance.\n\nThiel and Facebook co-founder Mosokvitz became involved outside of the social network long after Facebook's rise to prominence, with Thiel's Founder Fund becoming a significant investor in Moskovitz's company Asana in 2012. Thiel's longstanding symbiotic relationship with Facebook co-founders extends to his company Palantir, as the data that Facebook users make public invariably winds up in Palantir's databases and helps drive the surveillance engine Palantir runs for US police departments, the military, and the intelligence community. Facebook data also feeds another Thiel-backed company, Clearview AI.\n\nNotably, even LifeLog's architect, Douglas Gage, has publicly commented on Facebook's similarities to the program he had once hoped to lead. In 2015, He told VICE that \"Facebook is the real face of pseudo-LifeLog at this point.\" He tellingly added, \"We have ended up providing the same kind of detailed personal information to advertisers and data brokers and without arousing the kind of opposition that LifeLog provoked,\" precisely because it is now a private company and not a project housed at the Pentagon's DARPA.\n\nPalantir and the Surveillance Agenda under Trump\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Palantir enjoyed an even more privileged status than it had held under previous administrations, with Palantir gaining many new lucrative contracts, mainly with the military and intelligence, during Trump's first term. This was likely influenced by Thiel's presence on Trump's transition teams and the role of close Thiel associates in choosing key Pentagon appointees.\n\nNot only that, but the broader agenda behind Palantir - the decades-long effort to create a pre-crime, AI-powered surveillance system in the United States - also got significant boosts during Trump's first term. For instance, Trump's Attorney General William Barr quietly legalized pre-crime in the United States under the guise of detecting potential mass shooters before they commit any crime. The program, called DEEP, enables the DOJ and FBI to work with \"private sector partners\" to surveil people of interest that have committed no crime, but are \"mobilizing towards violence.\" At roughly the same time the program was announced, Barr was also pushing heavily for a government backdoor into consumer apps and devices, particularly those that utilize encryption. He also signed a data access agreement with then-UK Home Secretary Priti Patel that allowed both countries to \"demand electronic data on consumers from tech companies based in the other country without legal restrictions.\"\n\nAlso during the Trump administration, an Israeli intelligence-linked company called Carbyne911 began to be installed throughout the United States in emergency call centers and has since spread throughout the nation. Carbyne911 was heavily funded by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Trae Stephens sits on its advisory board alongside Michael Chertoff (head of DHS under George W. Bush) and Kirstjen Nielsen (head of DHS under Trump). Carbyne was also heavily funded by Jeffrey Epstein and Leslie Wexner and, for much of its early history, was closely associated with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, himself an intimate associate of Epstein.\n\nCarbyne911 and similar companies extract any and all data from consumer smartphones for merely making emergency calls and then use it to \"analyze the past and present behavior of their callers, react accordingly, and in time predict future patterns,\" with the ultimate goal of smart devices - such as \"smart\" street lamps - making emergency calls to the authorities, as opposed to human beings.\n\nData obtained from these software products, which are slated to be adopted nationwide as part of a new national \"next generation\" 911 system, are shared with the same law enforcement agencies now implementing the Barr-designed \"national disruption and early engagement program\" to target individuals flagged as potentially violent based on vague criteria. Combined with the \"domestic terror\" framework released during the Biden administration, the definition of \"domestic terrorists\" now encompasses those who oppose US government overreach and those who oppose any form of capitalism, including the World Economic Forum-favored \"stakeholder capitalism,\" and/or \"corporate globalization.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, during this same period, also mulled the creation of a new health-focused agency modeled after DARPA. The proposed \"HARPA\", which was promoted extensively to Trump by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka as well as Trump's close friend and former NBCUniversal president Bob Wright. HARPA's proposed flagship program - \"SAFE HOME\" (Stopping Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome Mental Extremes) - would use \"breakthrough technologies with high specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric violence,\" specifically \"advanced analytical tools based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\" The program would have cost an estimated $60 million over four years and would use data from Americans' social media accounts as well as \"Apple Watches, Fitbits, Amazon Echo and Google Home\" and other consumer electronic devices. The program would also collect information provided by health-care providers to identify who may be a \"threat.\"\n\nThough HARPA was not created under the Trump administration, Trump reportedly reacted \"very positively\" to the proposal and was \"sold on the concept.\" In addition, before the proposal was known publicly, Trump had called on Big Tech, and specifically social media to collaborate with the DOJ to create software that stops mass murders before they happen by detecting potential mass shooters before they can act. However, Trump ultimately passed on creating HARPA, which was ultimately created during the Biden administration as ARPA-H, underscoring the bipartisan nature of this agenda.\n\nAre Peter Thiel-Backed Intelligence Contractors \"MAGA\"?\n\nDespite many Thiel-backed or Thiel-founded companies describing themselves as \"America First\" and as defenders of \"Western values,\" a closer examination of those companies suggests this is not the case. One lesser known example of this is Palantir's early role in developing a way for the US government to target Julian Assange, leaks-based journalism in the public interest, and what it called \"The WikiLeaks Threat.\" In looking at other Thiel-linked firms, it's quite clear that at least some are more than willing to target Americans on either side of the political divide on behalf of their biggest client, the so-called \"Deep State\" that Trump supporters revile. Take, for example, the Thiel-backed Clearview AI - which claims to now be able to identify every person in the world using its advanced facial recognition system. As Unlimited Hangout contributor Stavroula Pabst noted in a recent report:\n\nWhen asked in an NBC interview about Clearview AI's possible negative ramifications for society, the company's CEO, Hoan Ton-That, said '[a] lot of peoples' minds on facial recognition technology were changed around Jan. 6th, when the insurrection happened [at the United States Capitol Building]. It was very instrumental in being able to make identifications quickly.'\n\nAs its own CEO stated, Clearview AI was used extensively on January 6th and later boasted of its \"potential for identifying rioters at the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\" In a 2023 interview, New York Times reporter Kashmir Hill added that, not only was Clearview AI used at the Capitol that day, but also in the days and weeks that followed to identify alleged rioters:\n\nThe FBI had photos of all these people because many of them were filming themselves on social media and posting photos online, and they weren't wearing masks. And so many police departments started running their photos through Clearview AI to identify them.\n\nAfter the events of January 6, 2021, Clearview AI reported a 26 percent uptake of its services from law enforcement, having used its role in targeting Trump supporters as a sales pitch.\n\nClearview AI is not the only Thiel-linked company willing to target Trump's base, as Palantir's co-founder and current CEO Alex Karp is obsessed with his long-time fear that the \"far right\" is going to murder him for his ethnic background. That fear, per Karp, \"propels a lot of the decisions\" made at Palantir. \"I still can't believe I haven't been shot and pushed out the window,\" Karp told New York Times reporter Michael Steinberger in 2020. Steinberger added that \"if the far right came to power, [Karp] said, he would certainly be among its victims. 'Who's the first person who is going to get hung? You make a list, and I will show you who they get first. It's me. There's not a box I don't check.'\"\n\nThen, in 2023, Karp stated during an interview at the World Economic Forum annual meeting that \"We built PG [proprietary software], which single-handedly stopped the rise of the far-right in Europe.\" Given that the labels \"far right\" as well as \"far left\" are often misused to describe those on either side of the political spectrum that do not subscribe to or support official narratives, it's worth asking if the \"far right\" Karp claims to have stopped referred to people who actually deserve the label, or right-leaning populism, given populism of any flavor is a threat to Palantir's benefactors in the corporate world and in the US National Security community.\n\nIn addition, Trump supporters that did not subscribe to official narratives around Covid-19-era policies should be aware of Palantir's role in the Trump administration's Covid response and also in the Covid vaccination roll-out. During Covid, Palantir developed Tiberius, which was used by HHS to \"help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccine each state will receive\" and also to \"decide where every allocated dose will go - from local doctors' offices to large medical centers.\" Tiberius, and by extension Palantir, collected all the Covid-19 and healthcare data from US government agencies, local and state governments, pharmaceutical firms, vaccine manufacturers and companies contracted to act as vaccine distributers. Palantir was also provided Americans' sensitive health information by the Trump-era HHS as well as \"a wide range of demographic, employment and public health data sets\" in order to \"help identify high-priority populations\" to receive the vaccine first. During Covid, Palantir was also a member of the Covid-19 Health Coalition, whose other members included the CIA's In-Q-Tel, which was Palantir's first funder, as well as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\n\nPalantir also managed the HHS Protect database, a secretive database that hoarded (and still hoards) information related to the spread of Covid-19 gathered from \"more than 225 data sets, including demographic statistics, community-based tests, and a wide range of state-provided data.\" At the time, HHS Protect was criticized by several public health experts and epidemiologists, among others, because of the sudden decision by the Trump-era HHS to force US hospitals to provide all data on COVID-19 cases and patient information directly to HHS Protect and, thus, to Palantir. Hospitals were threatened with the loss of Medicare or Medicaid funding if they declined to regularly feed all of their COVID-19 patient data and test results into the HHS Protect database. Palantir declined to provide information on any safeguards it had in place to protect Americans' health data in any of its HHS-related programs, despite requests to do so from Senators and Congressmen. HHS Protect also later incorporated HHS Vision, an artificial intelligence-driven \"predictive\" component, which \"uses prewritten algorithms to simulate behaviors and forecast possible outcomes.\" Aspects of HHS Protect share remarkable similarities with the scrapped TIA sub-program known as \"Bio-surveillance.\"\n\nNot only that, but a long-time consultant to Palantir, Avril Haines, was a key fixture at the controversial pandemic \"simulation\" in late 2019 that was tied to previous, intelligence-linked biosecurity events like the 2001 anthrax attacks. Haines, a former CIA deputy director, worked very closely with her superior, John Brennan, at the CIA, including during the time Brennan illegally surveilled Trump associates during the 2016 election cycle and helped propagate and develop the \"Russiagate\" narrative, which Haines is now conveniently resurrecting. Haines, shortly after participating in Event 201, joined the Biden administration and has been serving as the administration's top intelligence official - the Director of National Intelligence - since Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nPalantir is also controversial among the America left for its role in using big data to facilitate ICE raids on migrants and its decision to pilot its \"predictive policing\", i.e. pre-crime, functionality in low-income, minority communities. Ultimately, Palantir - like many of the other military/intelligence contractors with close ties to Peter Thiel - is a tool of the National Security State, which has been ramping up its \"War on Domestic Terror\" apparatus that - per government documentation - will target dissent on both left and right and essentially anyone who attempts to stand, or even speak, against government overreach and criminality.\n\nWith Thiel, Palantir and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale now pumping millions into the Trump-Vance campaign after the recent VP announcement, it seems almost inevitable that Palantir and the other Thiel-linked military contractors will have even more influence in a second Trump administration than it did during his first term.", "source": {"uri": "sonsoflibertymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sons of Liberty Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "whitney_webb@sonsoflibertymedia.com", "name": "Whitney Webb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DARPA LifeLog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palmer Luckey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_(workflow_engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anduril (workflow engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Main Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Poindexter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palantir Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oliver North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\u2013Contra_affair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran\u2013Contra affair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In-Q-Tel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Since Trump picked Vance as his VP, a slew of other tech billionaires have gone public in support of Trump, their fellow billionaire.\n\nSome of the more high-profile backers includes Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk, who The Wall Street Journal reported is planning to donate $45 million a month to a pro-Trump super PAC, as well as venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who announced earlier this week that they plan to make large donations to groups backing Trump.\n\nAndreessen and Horowitz say they're supporting a Trump-Vance ticket because they believe Trump will be better for tech companies -- like the ones they have stakes in -- than Joe Biden because they disagree with his policies around AI, cryptocurrency, and tax policy.\n\nSilicon Valley entrepreneur and podcaster David Sacks is also backing Trump and Vance, and in a post to X this week, he listed many other Silicon Valley executives and entrepreneurs backing Trump and Vance.\n\nThe growing number of tech billionaires supporting Trump and Vance mirrors rising support for the Republican ticket among billionaires at large.\n\nIn fact, more than five dozen billionaires are now backing Trump for president as he's promised to slash taxes for the ultra-wealthy, according to a More Perfect Union. More than a dozen new billionaire Trump backers were revealed just this week, according to new campaign finance filings.\n\nNone of this is shocking, however, as Trump himself has spent the better part of the last several months promising billionaires tax cuts in exchange for campaign donations.\n\nIn April, Trump asked oil industry executives to donate $1 billion to his reelection campaign in exchange for his reversal of dozens of President Biden's environmental policies should he be elected in November, for example. He also promised to stop future ones from being enacted, effectively saving them billions due to tax cuts and avoided regulations.\n\n\"So give me some of your money,\" Trump said at a May fundraiser hosted by Harold Hamm, an oil executive. \"I'm begging for your money.\"\n\nTrump also met with wealthy donors at a New York hotel in May, where he explained to attendees that it was in their best interest to invest in his campaign because President Biden has vowed to let Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations expire at the end of 2025. And last month, the former president met with 80 CEOs in Washington and promised them that they'll see tax cuts and a decrease of business regulations should he be elected.\n\nVance also has close ties to Big Pharma, Big Oil, and has the support of countless corporate CEOs.\n\nVance spent less than five years in Silicon Valley's tech industry, where he worked as a junior venture capitalist and a biotech executive. He certainly didn't shake up the tech world during this stint, but those few years were crucial to fostering his connections with the ultra-wealthy.\n\nPeople like Thiel and Musk have funded Vance's political aspirations over the years, while simultaneously raising his profile among other wealthy donors and on social media. In fact, Vance met Thiel over a decade ago after the investor delivered a speech at Yale, where Vance attended law school.\n\nVance partially credits Thiel's speech, in which he argued law students' time would be better spent in Silicon Valley, for influencing his decision to move to the San Francisco Bay Area just a few years later.\n\n\"Peter's talk remains the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School,\" Vance wrote in a 2020 essay for a Catholic literary journal.\n\nThiel even went on to write a promotional blurb for Vance's 2016 memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which depicted his childhood growing up in Jackson, Kentucky and Middletown, Ohio. Around the time his memoir was published, Thiel gained notoriety for his support of Trump during the 2016 election.\n\nAfter using his connections to snag a few mid-level positions at a few different venture firms, and even becoming a partner at one of them, Vance turned to his connections--former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, Andreessen, and Thiel -- in 2020 to help fund his own venture capital firm.\n\nAround the same time, Vance became interested in backing tech platforms favored by conservatives, such as social network Parler and YouTube competitor Rumble. In 2021, Vance co-founded a network of major conservative donors called the Rockbridge Network before announcing his run for office.\n\nVance has also gotten help from Sacks, who donated $1 million to a political action committee backing his campaign in 2022, and who hosted a fundraiser for the Trump campaign at his Pacific Heights mansion last month, which Vance himself attended.\n\nDuring this event, Trump reportedly asked Sacks, tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya, and the others in attendance whom he should choose as his running mate. According to two people with knowledge of this exchange and who spoke to The New York Times, everyone agreed that Trump should choose Vance.\n\nThe former president has also \"been impressed by Mr. Sacks's wealth and media profile,\" a person familiar with Trump's thinking told The New York Times earlier this week.\n\nSacks celebrated Vance being chosen for the VP slot on X on Monday afternoon, saying \"this is who I want by Trump's side,\" and spoke at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee later that night.\n\nAnd although Thiel's relationship with Trump has gotten rocky in the past several years -- at a June conference in Colorado, Thiel said he would vote for Trump only \"if you hold a gun to my head\" -- the billionaire investor is reportedly much more likely to vote for the former president now that Vance is his running mate.\n\nAs for the reason that so many tech billionaires are suddenly backing Trump and Vance, fellow billionaire Mark Cuban offered one explanation: cryptocurrency.\n\n\"It's a bitcoin play,\" Cuban said, arguing that these tech execs are backing Trump because his policies are likely to be inflationary, create geopolitical uncertainty, and destabilize the dollar's status as the primary reserve currency used by other countries, all of which together could drive up the price of Bitcoin and make these billionaires even richer.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times reported, Andreessen -- whose firm is one of the biggest cryptocurrency investors in the world -- has publicly criticized the Biden administration's investigations into crypto startups, which are often rife with fraud and frequently scam ordinary Americans out of their savings.\n\n\"This is a brutal assault to a nascent industry that has never happened before,\" Marc Andreessen recently said on the \"The Ben & Marc Show\" podcast.\n\nCrypto businesses also face issues when trying to get financing from banks, and these entrepreneurs are confident Trump will make their lives easier with both regulations and borrowing.\n\nTrump's campaign platform has vowed to end the \"unAmerican Crypto crackdown\" and to \"defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control.\"\n\nAndreessen has also claimed that President Biden's capital gains tax proposal -- which would tax an individual's assets worth $100 million or more -- would make startups \"completely implausible.\"\n\nWhether it's traditional conservative issues that are motivating this circle of tech billionaires (tax cuts for the rich and corporations) or more modern conservative economic interests (cryptocurrency and AI), this week made one thing clear: they're all in on Trump and Vance.", "source": {"uri": "iowastartingline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iowa Starting Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabel_soisson@iowastartingline.com", "name": "Isabel Soisson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Thiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Andreessen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Horowitz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Horowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Trump_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Never Trump movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David O.

He is then recruited from an Ivy league law school by shadow figures, a specific billionaire and a network of interests. He changes his name, writes a book about his life story, and with the support of the aforementioned - who eventually pays for the assembly of a strategic campaign influence network, becomes a Senator for 2 years before being quickly elevated into position in the White House.\n\nMany people reading that paragraph would be familiar with the life story of Barack Hussien Obama. However, that paragraph also explains the right-side version of the exact same storyline, James David Vance. It's a mirror.\n\nOn one side of the UniParty mirror we have an emotionally constructed political figure for the left. On the other side of the UniParty mirror we have an emotionally constructed political figure for the right. Each person, each emotional narrative, carrying the specific nuances to appeal to their wing of the UniParty audience. However, both are following the same playbook.\n\nIt started with a conversation several weeks ago. Who is JD Vance and where did he come from?\n\nHow does a person without any baseline in politics, not a council member, not a mayor, not a state rep - or state senate, governor etc., become a U.S. Senator and then quickly get into the White House?\n\nWhat I was told sounded eerily familiar.\n\nJD Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio (August 2, 1984). He then changed his name to James David Bowman. He then changed his name to James David Hamel. Eventually, in 2014, notably after Yale Law School (class of 2013) and after marrying his wife Usha, now age 30, he changed his name to write a book.\n\nIt was 2014, that's when JD Vance was born.\n\nVance's book, Hillbilly Elegy was published by Rupert Murdoch's publishing house, Harper Collins in 2016. The book was made into a Netflix movie, [Reed Hastings] created by Imagine Entertainment and directed by Ron Howard (2020). However, the interesting background on JD Vance goes back to Yale, and the Obamaesque tap on the shoulder that comes from a billionaire most are familiar with, Peter Thiel.\n\nThiel first recruited Vance into his circle while Vance was still a student at Yale Law School. Shortly thereafter, Vance joined Thiel's investment firm Mithril Capital, where he worked for two years before joining Revolution Ventures. Vance played a major role in Revolution's \"Rise of the Rest\" seed fund whose major investors included Amazon's Jeff Bezos. {Citation}\n\nFrom this timeline we can see how JD Vance went from no money (student loans) in 2013, to big money in 2020. Everything came via Peter Thiel and Eric Schmidt, but mostly Thiel.\n\nTo understand JD Vance as an Ohio senator, the inflection points in 2013 and the subsequent relationship with billionaire Peter Thiel (Palantir Technologies) from 2013 to now, becomes important.\n\nBillionaires Eric Schmidt and Peter Thiel are key members of the steering committee of the controversial, closed-door and overtly globalist Bilderberg conference. Newsweek once called Schmidt and Thiel the two most influential figures at Bilderberg.\n\nPeter Thiel's company Palantir Tech is the driving force of a global surveillance system using artificial intelligence (AI). Palantir has massive contract interests in US military and intelligence communities.\n\nKeep in mind, Palantir is the current company creating the tech mechanisms for the U.S government to conduct foreign and domestic surveillance. The actual technology needed by the Deep State to advance their interests, is provided by Peter Thiel. {Citation}\n\nAccording to the popular narrative, JD Vance opposes the Intelligence Community deep surveillance state, while simultaneously being the political front for the interests of Peter Thiel and Palantir Technology? This doesn't reconcile.\n\nPeter Thiel was the money and network behind the 2022 Ohio senate race between JD Vance and Tim Ryan. It was Peter Thiel who took JD Vance to meet President Trump in Mar-a-Lago to get the needed endorsement to launch Vance into the U.S. Senate. Without Thiel there is no Senator JD Vance.\n\nIt is also important to remember that prior to 2018; prior to Peter Thiel becoming aligned with the FBI as a confidential human source, and prior to Vance needing the Trump endorsement; JD Vance was a staunch never-Trumper.\n\nJD Vance went from calling President Trump \"a literal Hitler,\" to appreciating Trump's incredible leadership, a remarkable shift in opinion. To his strategic credit, Peter Thiel was successful in gaining both the endorsement and the outcome of the 2022 Ohio senate race.\n\nWithin the Thiel network you will note the aligned interests of another key financial friend and big federal contractor, Elon Musk. Together, Musk and Thiel form the core of a very wealthy group of modern tech political influence agents, including another Yale Law School graduate and JD Vance supporter, Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nJD Vance even named one of his three children Vivek; suffice to say, they are close.\n\nWhat you have read so far is the background of how one billionaire, Thiel, deeply enmeshed in the surveillance state creates the process to construct a political tool useful for the retention of his interests. A few dozen millions are a worthy investment if the investment creates and supports the objectives of the billionaire (Palantir Technology).\n\nUnfortunately, this approach also diminishes the Trump policy objective intended to eliminate the IC deep state.\n\nAs an outcome of a control network in 2006 Senator Barack Obama was successfully installed. As an outcome of a control network in 2022 Senator JD Vance was successfully installed. Both Barry Sotero (Obama) and James Bowman (Vance) are mirror images of each other; the playbooks used to create both are identical.\n\nWe have exhaustively outlined the UniParty operation in Washington DC. What was once a radical concept and controversial, is now accepted as factual. Additionally, we have outlined the how the Fourth Branch of Government was created under Obama. What was once conspiracy theory is now accepted as the truth.\n\nOnce you understand how both wings of the UniParty operate you can then see how the system of silo creation, retention and protection works.\n\nThe Obama network ultimately led to the modern IC surveillance state. The Vance network now appears to be positioned to retain it.\n\nLike an abuser toward the abused, our ideological enemy uses our virtues of love and trust as weapons. We are in an abusive relationship with government.\n\n\u2666 ALL IS NOT LOST - In everything that happens, the geopolitical power players -including the Intelligence Community- have what are called \"strategic interests.\" Meaning, they plan out their future position based on current events (data), pathways and predictions.\n\nSome of these power structures are, putting it mildly, not good. In fact, they are eroding liberty, freedom and making us serfs. We feel it daily.\n\nIn order to best weaken them and/or make them more vulnerable, you put them into a position where they cannot strategize the future because they cannot confirm a data point in their pathway.\n\nHaving a known 2028 U.S. presidential nominee gives them the ability to plan for it. They are able to make moves to get beyond the 2024 to 2028 challenges they face; they look toward who they will be faced with as an opponent in '28.\n\nFrom that position, they conduct enemy operations against Trump's strategy.... they essentially plan to outlast him, ignore him, put on a mask when they talk to him etc.\n\nPresident Trump, making it known who will be the '28 nominee actually gives his opposition power. Essentially makes Trump's position less strong.\n\nHad Trump selected a \"one-term\" running mate (I don't care who it would have been), the opposition would not know what to expect in 2028. They are then forced to focus every day on what Trump is doing now. That opposition cannot not look forward (proactive), they are forced to react. They are kept vulnerable.\n\nDo you want your enemies planning, or do you want them reacting to the unknown variables?\n\nDo you want them focused on your attack, or do you want them brushing you off as irrelevant in the longer term?\n\nDo you want them on their heels each day/week as they try to figure out what you are doing.... or do you want them to know the destination ahead, regardless of the daily or weekly policy moves?\n\nBy selecting a VP nominee that will be the 2028 presidential nominee (what 90% of short-sighted people wanted), Trump can give greater power to the ideological enemy.\n\nFor the next four years, the deep state at home and geopolitical enemy abroad, must not know what they will face in the future.\n\nFrom that position of potential vulnerability, they are forced to focus on daily events and counterstrategies, while unable -by design- to compromise the future opponent.\n\nI never resign Trump to a failed position, as long as there is a way to turn a necessary decision into a winning and more powerful position.\n\nThe problem of Peter Thiel, his network and the potential problem JD Vance represents can be dealt with.\n\nPresident Donald J Trump makes it very well known, and constantly reminds people for 3 years, that if JD Vance sucks, flinches, is inept or doesn't follow orders, then JD Vance doesn't get the 2028 endorsement. Thankfully, I saw the first indications of this last night during President Trump's acceptance speech at the RNC Convention.\n\nFor Trump supporters and all supporters of the goal to deconstruct the worst and most toxic elements of the Deep State, we must support that tenuous 2028 endorsement message. After all, we are expecting Vance to uphold actionable policies against the interests of his benefactors.\n\nThose benefactors and the aligned Vance influence network includes Charlie Kirk, Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Bill Ackman, David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya, Jacob Helberg, Vivek Ramaswamy and of course, many more.\n\nI don't care about anything that happened prior to that 2013 inflection point, the tap on the shoulder at Yale. James Donald Bowman, aka JD Vance's background construct as lived or as sold is irrelevant to me. We do not have the time to be emotionally attached to any individual. We need actionable results.\n\nWe are not going to be battered conservatives, pushed yet again into the position of Charlie Brown to Lucy's deep state, 'trust the plan' football. The trust account of the American electorate is bankrupt. Corruption is running amok.\n\nThe threat to JD Vance's political career must be actual, loud and repeated often to keep the toxic IC and domestic Silo operators guessing. While simultaneously, every righteous attack takes down a small segment like a bite out of an elephant.\n\nWe accept that this approach is going to make Peter Thiel, JD Vance and the entire Thiel/Musk network quite unhappy.", "source": {"uri": "theconservativetreehouse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Last Refuge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Vance has his own controversies, his close connection to billionaire Peter Thiel, who is poised to have unprecedented influence in a new Trump administration, should deeply unsettle every American who cares about freedom, privacy and reining in the surveillance state.\n\nAfter the recent revelation that Donald Trump had selected J.D. Vance as his Vice President, public attention not only turned toward Vance, but also to the billionaire Peter Thiel. Vance has been one of several prominent Thiel prot\u00e9g\u00e9s whose profile has risen in recent years, with other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the PayPal co-founder including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anduril's Palmer Luckey.\n\nRecent reports have also noted that Thiel first recruited Vance into his circle while Vance was still a student at Yale Law School. Shortly thereafter, Vance joined Thiel's investment firm Mithril Capital, where he worked for two years before joining Revolution Ventures. Vance played a major role in Revolution's \"Rise of the Rest\" seed fund whose major investors included Amazon's Jeff Bezos and the Walton family of WalMart, who boast long-standing deep ties to the Clinton family. Vance later launched his own venture capital firm Narya Capital in 2020, which was heavily funded by Thiel as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt, a major Democrat donor, has been the guiding hand behind the Biden administration's science and technology policy and has dominated the development of the AI policies of the US military and intelligence communities, largely through his leadership of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, the Schmidt-led NSCAI promoted policies like the end of private car ownership and in-person shopping in the United States to advance Americans' adoption of AI as supposed national security imperative in the lead-up to the Covid-era lockdowns.Both Schmidt and Thiel are key members of the steering committee of the controversial, closed-door and overtly globalist Bilderberg conference. Newsweek once called Schmidt and Thiel the two most influential figures at Bilderberg.\n\nBuy All-American!

Thiel also joined Vance, a former \"Never Trumper,\" on a visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago where Vance successfully won the former president's blessing. Thiel also connected Vance to other members of the so-called PayPal mafia, like David Sacks who donated $1 million to Vance and hosted a fundraiser for him. Sacks, along with PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, were allegedly a key factor in Trump's selection of Vance as Vice President as they ran \"a secret lobbying campaign\" for Vance that also included media presenter Tucker Carlson.\n\nThiel had been a major donor to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and served on Trump's transition team, with other Thiel-linked figures like Trae Stephens dramatically influencing Trump's Pentagon appointments. Stephens' influence at the Trump Pentagon also helped develop the military's relationship with the Thiel-funded company Anduril, which was co-founded by Stephens and Thiel fellow Palmer Luckey. Before Anduril, Luckey develop the Virual Reality system Oculus Rift, which was later sold to Facebook, where Thiel then served on the board. Anduril is now building a \"virtual border wall\" for the federal government and Trump, who long campaigned on building a physical barrier on the US-Mexico border, abandoned that promise during his first term and now supports the exact solution Anduril is selling.\n\nAnduril's unmanned drones have also come to play a major role in Ukrainian military operations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as have other controversial Thiel-funded companies like Palantir (a CIA contractor) and ClearView AI, which used mainly photos posted on Facebook (another Thiel-backed company) to develop its Orwellian facial recognition database. These companies' close ties to the Ukrainian military may impact a second Trump administration's policies as it relates to American support for Ukraine, particularly if Thiel is slated to hold significant influence. Beyond Ukraine, this network of Thiel-funded defense companies are remaking the face of warfare and slowly but surely replacing human decision-making with AI.\n\nWhile these ties should be unsettling on their own, the potential influence of Thiel on the upcoming Trump administration should concern every American, regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, due to Thiel's efforts to rehabilitate and remake some of the intelligence communities' most Orwellian and unconstitutional efforts to target domestic dissent.\n\nThiel Information Awareness\n\nWhile Peter Thiel has long marketed himself as a libertarian, his track record from PayPal on has revealed him to instead be an architect of the modern surveillance state and a successor to the neoconservative cabal that had once tried (but failed) to do the same. During PayPal's earliest days, Thiel and his colleagues went around to various government agencies, including intelligence agencies, to see how they could best tailor their product to win government support (and contracts) for their products and services. After leaving PayPal, Thiel would follow a similar path in creating another company, Palantir. Palantir is the engine on which the surveillance state runs and, soon after Vance was announced as Trump's Vice President, it was reported that Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale as well as Palantir itself were backing a Trump-Vance super PAC called America PAC.\n\nUnlimited Hangout has reported extensively on Thiel and Palantir for several years. As noted in past reports, the company was created to be the privatized version of a post-9/11 surveillance program that had been dreamt up by the Iran-Contra criminals responsible for the unconstitutional Main Core database. During the Reagan administration, the individuals at the heart of the Iran-Contra scandal developed a database called Main Core, which firmly placed the US national-security state on its current, tech-fuelled path for crushing dissent. A senior government official with a high-ranking security clearance and service in five presidential administrations told Radar in 2008 that Main Core was \"a database of Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic might be incarcerated. The database can identify and locate perceived 'enemies of the state' almost instantaneously.\"\n\nMain Core was expressly developed for use in \"continuity of government\" (COG) protocols by the key Iran-Contra figure Oliver North and his allies that operated an \"off the books\" intelligence apparatus with direct CIA involvement known as \"The Enterprise.\" North and his associates used COG and Main Core to compile a list of US dissidents and \"potential troublemakers\" to be dealt with if the continuity of government protocol was ever invoked. Troublingly, these protocols could be invoked for a variety of reasons, including widespread public, non-violent opposition to a US military intervention abroad, widespread internal dissent, or a vaguely defined moment of \"national crisis\" or \"time of panic.\" North would later brush up against the Trump administration, joining former Blackwater founder Erik Prince in an effort to lobby the administration to create an \"off the books,\" private CIA.\n\nMain Core utilized the PROMIS software, which was stolen from its owners at Inslaw Inc. by top Reagan and US intelligence officials as well as Israeli spymaster Rafi Eitan. Also intimately involved in the PROMIS scandal was media baron and Israeli \"super spy\" Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell and reportedly the man who brought Jeffrey Epstein into the Israeli intelligence orbit. Like PROMIS, Main Core involved both US and Israeli intelligence and was a big data approach to the surveillance of perceived domestic dissidents.\n\nThe Iran-Contra and PROMIS scandals were exposed, but were subsequently covered up, largely by the then US attorney general William Barr, who would return to serve in that same position during the Trump administration. The use of Main Core by the federal government persisted and continued to amass data. That data could not be fully tapped into and utilized by the intelligence community until after the events of September 11, 2001, which offered a golden opportunity for the use of such tools against the domestic US population, all under the guise of combating \"terrorism.\" For example, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 government officials reportedly saw Main Core being accessed by White House computers.\n\nSeptember 11 was also used as an excuse to remove information \"firewalls\" within the national-security state, expanding \"information sharing\" among agency databases and, by extension, also expanding the amount of data that could be accessed and analyzed by Main Core and its analogues. As Alan Wade, then serving as the CIA's chief information officer, pointed out soon after 9/11: \"One of the post-September 11 themes is collaboration and information sharing. We're looking at tools that facilitate communication in ways that we don't have today.\"\n\nIn an attempt to build on these two post-9/11 objectives simultaneously, the US national-security state attempted to create a \"public-private\" surveillance program so invasive that Congress defunded it just months after its creation due to concerns it would completely eliminate the right to privacy in the US. Called Total Information Awareness (TIA), the program sought to develop an \"all-seeing\" surveillance apparatus managed by the Pentagon's DARPA. TIA's supporters argued that invasive surveillance of the entire US population was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks, bioterrorism events, and even naturally occurring disease outbreaks (such as pandemics) before they could take place.\n\nThe architect of TIA, and the man who led it during its relatively brief existence, was John Poindexter, best known for being Reagan's National Security Advisor during Iran-Contra and being convicted of five felonies in relation to that scandal. Poindexter, during the Iran-Contra hearings, had famously claimed that it was his duty to withhold information from Congress.\n\nIn regard to TIA, one of Poindexter's key allies was the chief information officer of the CIA, Alan Wade. Wade met with Poindexter in relation to TIA numerous times and managed the participation of not just the CIA but all US intelligence agencies that had signed on to add their data as \"nodes\" to TIA and, in exchange, gained access to its tools. Wade, while at the CIA, had previously partnered with Robert Maxwell's daughter, Christine Maxwell, on national security software called Chiliad, which had similarities to TIA (as well as Palantir) but fell short of the proposed program's scope and ambition. Christine had previously been involved in her father's efforts to market bugged PROMIS software to US national laboratories.\n\nThe TIA program, despite the best efforts of Poindexter and his allies such as Wade, was eventually forced to shut down after considerable criticism and public outrage. Though the program was defunded, it later emerged that TIA was never actually shut down, with its various programs having been covertly divided among the web of military and intelligence agencies that make up the US national security state. While some of those TIA programs went underground, the core panopticon software that TIA had hoped to wield began to be developed by the company now known as Palantir, with considerable help from the CIA and Alan Wade, as well as Poindexter.\n\nAt the time it was formally launched in February 2003, the TIA program was immediately controversial, leading it to change its name in May 2003 to Terrorism Information Awareness in an apparent attempt to sound less like an all-encompassing domestic surveillance system and more like a tool specifically aimed at \"terrorists.\" The TIA program was shuttered by the end of 2003.\n\nThe same month as the TIA name change Peter Thiel incorporated Palantir. Thiel, however, had begun creating the software behind Palantir months in advance, though he claims he can't recall exactly when. Some reports state that Palantir began as an anti-fraud algorithm at Thiel's PayPal. Thiel, Karp, and other Palantir cofounders claimed for years that the company had been founded in 2004, despite the paperwork of Palantir's incorporation by Thiel directly contradicting this claim.\n\nAlso, in 2003, apparently soon after Thiel formally created Palantir, Iraq War architect and Bush-era neoconservative Richard Perle called Poindexter, saying that he wanted to introduce the architect of TIA to two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp. According to a report in New York Magazine, Poindexter \"was precisely the person\" whom Thiel and Karp wanted to meet, mainly because \"their new company was similar in ambition to what Poindexter had tried to create at the Pentagon,\" that is, TIA. During that meeting, Thiel and Karp sought \"to pick the brain of the man now widely viewed as the godfather of modern surveillance,\" shaping Palantir into a TIA equivalent.\n\nSoon after Palantir's incorporation, though the exact timing and details of the investment remain hidden from the public, the CIA's In-Q-Tel became the company's first backer, aside from Thiel himself, giving it an estimated $2 million. In-Q-Tel's stake in Palantir would not be publicly reported until mid-2006. In addition, Alex Karp recently told the New York Times that \"the real value of the In-Q-Tel investment was that it gave Palantir access to the CIA analysts who were its intended clients.\" A key figure in the making of In-Q-Tel investments during this period, including Palantir, was the CIA's chief information officer at the time, Alan Wade.\n\nAfter the In-Q-Tel investment, the CIA held the unique position of being Palantir's only client until 2008. During that period, Palantir's two top engineers -- Aki Jain and Stephen Cohen -- traveled to CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia every two weeks. Jain recalls making at least two hundred trips to CIA headquarters between 2005 and 2009. During those regular visits, CIA analysts \"would test [Palantir's software] out and offer feedback, and then Cohen and Jain would fly back to California to tweak it.\" As with In-Q-Tel's decision to invest in Palantir, the CIA's chief information officer at the time, Alan Wade, played a key role in many of these meetings and subsequently in the \"tweaking\" of Palantir's products. It should come as no surprise, then, that there is an overlap between Palantir's products and the vision that Wade and Poindexter had held for the failed TIA program. The extensive overlap between the two is detailed in previous Unlimited Hangout investigations.\n\nThe benefits in repurposing the \"public-private\" TIA into a completely private entity after TIA was publicly dismantled are obvious. For instance, given that Palantir is a private company as opposed to a government program, the way its software is used by its government and corporate clients benefits from \"plausible deniability\" and frees Palantir and its software from constraints that would be present if it had remained a public project.\n\nA 2020 New York Times profile on Palantir noted:\n\nThe data, which is stored in various cloud services or on clients' premises, is controlled by the customer, and Palantir says it does not police the use of its products. Nor are the privacy controls foolproof; it is up to the customers to decide who gets to see what and how vigilant they wish to be.\n\nThe Social Media Panopticon\n\nNot long after Thiel helped resurrect TIA as Palantir, another post-9/11 DARPA program was also seeking a private sector makeover. Developed by Douglas Gage, a close friend of Poindexter's and a DARPA program manager, LifeLog sought to \"build a database tracking a person's entire existence\" that included an individual's relationships and communications (phone calls, mail, etc.), their media-consumption habits, their purchases, and much more in order to build a digital record of \"everything an individual says, sees, or does.\" LifeLog would then take this unstructured data and organize it into \"discreet episodes\" or snapshots while also \"mapping out relationships, memories, events and experiences.\"\n\nLifeLog, per Gage and supporters of the program, would create a permanent and searchable electronic diary of a person's entire life, which DARPA argued could be used to create next-generation \"digital assistants\" and offer users a \"near-perfect digital memory.\" Gage insisted, even after the program was shut down, that individuals would have had \"complete control of their own data-collection efforts\" as they could \"decide when to turn the sensors on or off and decide who will share the data.\" In the years since then, analogous promises of user control have been made by the tech giants of Silicon Valley, only to be broken repeatedly for profit and to feed the government's domestic-surveillance apparatus.\n\nThe information that LifeLog gleaned from an individual's every interaction with technology was to be combined with information obtained from a GPS transmitter that tracked and documented the person's location, audio-visual sensors that recorded what the person saw and said, as well as biomedical monitors that gauged the person's health. Like TIA, LifeLog was promoted by DARPA as potentially supporting \"medical research and the early detection of an emerging epidemic.\"\n\nCritics in mainstream media outlets and elsewhere were quick to point out that the program would inevitably be used to build profiles on dissidents as well as suspected terrorists. Combined with TIA's surveillance of individuals at multiple levels, LifeLog went farther by \"adding physical information (like how we feel) and media data (like what we read) to this transactional data.\" One critic, Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, warned at the time that the programs that DARPA was pursuing, including LifeLog, \"have obvious, easy paths to Homeland Security deployments.\"\n\nAt the time, DARPA publicly insisted that LifeLog and TIA were not connected, despite their obvious parallels, and that LifeLog would not be used for \"clandestine surveillance.\" However, DARPA's own documentation on LifeLog noted that the project \"will be able . . . to infer the user's routines, habits and relationships with other people, organizations, places and objects, and to exploit these patterns to ease its task,\" which acknowledged its potential use as a tool of mass surveillance.\n\nHowever, despite its proponents' best efforts, LifeLog was shuttered just like TIA. Given what had transpired with TIA, some suspected the program would continue under a different name. For example, Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation told VICE at the time of LifeLog's cancellation, that: \"It would not surprise me to learn that the government continued to fund research that pushed this area forward without calling it LifeLog.\" Along with its critics, one of the would-be researchers working on LifeLog, MIT's David Karger, was also certain that the DARPA project would continue in a repackaged form. He told Wired that \"I am sure such research will continue to be funded under some other title . . . I can't imagine DARPA 'dropping out' of a such a key research area.\" The answer to these speculations appears to lie with the company that launched the exact same day that LifeLog was shuttered by the Pentagon: Facebook.\n\nThe Military Origins of Facebook Facebook's growing role in the ever-expanding surveillance and \"pre-crime\" apparatus of the national security state demands new scrutiny of the company's origins and its products as they relate to a former, controversial DARPA-run surveillance program that was essentially analogous to what is currently the world's largest social network.\n\nA few months into Facebook's launch, in June 2004, Facebook co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz brought Sean Parker onto Facebook's executive team. Parker, previously known for co-founding Napster, later connected Facebook with its first outside investor, Peter Thiel. As discussed, Thiel, at that time, in coordination with the CIA, was actively trying to resurrect at least one controversial DARPA program that had been dismantled the previous year. Notably, Sean Parker, who became Facebook's first president, also had a history with the CIA, which sought to recruit him at the age of sixteen soon after he had been busted by the FBI for hacking corporate and military databases. Thanks to Parker, in September 2004, Thiel formally acquired $500,000 worth of Facebook shares and was added its board. Parker maintained close ties to Facebook as well as to Thiel, with Parker being hired as a managing partner of Thiel's Founders Fund in 2006. Thiel left the Facebook board, which he had joined in 2005, in 2022 to focus on supporting \"Trump-aligned candidates,\" including J.D. Vance.\n\nThiel and Facebook co-founder Mosokvitz became involved outside of the social network long after Facebook's rise to prominence, with Thiel's Founder Fund becoming a significant investor in Moskovitz's company Asana in 2012. Thiel's longstanding symbiotic relationship with Facebook co-founders extends to his company Palantir, as the data that Facebook users make public invariably winds up in Palantir's databases and helps drive the surveillance engine Palantir runs for US police departments, the military, and the intelligence community. Facebook data also feeds another Thiel-backed company, Clearview AI.\n\nNotably, even LifeLog's architect, Douglas Gage, has publicly commented on Facebook's similarities to the program he had once hoped to lead. In 2015, He told VICE that \"Facebook is the real face of pseudo-LifeLog at this point.\" He tellingly added, \"We have ended up providing the same kind of detailed personal information to advertisers and data brokers and without arousing the kind of opposition that LifeLog provoked,\" precisely because it is now a private company and not a project housed at the Pentagon's DARPA.\n\nPalantir and the Surveillance Agenda under Trump\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Palantir enjoyed an even more privileged status than it had held under previous administrations, with Palantir gaining many new lucrative contracts, mainly with the military and intelligence, during Trump's first term. This was likely influenced by Thiel's presence on Trump's transition teams and the role of close Thiel associates in choosing key Pentagon appointees.\n\nNot only that, but the broader agenda behind Palantir - the decades-long effort to create a pre-crime, AI-powered surveillance system in the United States - also got significant boosts during Trump's first term. For instance, Trump's Attorney General William Barr quietly legalized pre-crime in the United States under the guise of detecting potential mass shooters before they commit any crime. The program, called DEEP, enables the DOJ and FBI to work with \"private sector partners\" to surveil people of interest that have committed no crime, but are \"mobilizing towards violence.\" At roughly the same time the program was announced, Barr was also pushing heavily for a government backdoor into consumer apps and devices, particularly those that utilize encryption. He also signed a data access agreement with then-UK Home Secretary Priti Patel that allowed both countries to \"demand electronic data on consumers from tech companies based in the other country without legal restrictions.\"\n\nAlso during the Trump administration, an Israeli intelligence-linked company called Carbyne911 began to be installed throughout the United States in emergency call centers and has since spread throughout the nation. Carbyne911 was heavily funded by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Trae Stephens sits on its advisory board alongside Michael Chertoff (head of DHS under George W. Bush) and Kirstjen Nielsen (head of DHS under Trump). Carbyne was also heavily funded by Jeffrey Epstein and Leslie Wexner and, for much of its early history, was closely associated with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, himself an intimate associate of Epstein.\n\nHow the CIA, Mossad and \"the Epstein Network\" are Exploiting Mass Shootings to Create an Orwellian Nightmare Israel's Mossad and infamous Unit 8200 are partnering with the CIA and US tech firms to create an Orwellian pre-crime nightmare.\n\nCarbyne911 and similar companies extract any and all data from consumer smartphones for merely making emergency calls and then use it to \"analyze the past and present behavior of their callers, react accordingly, and in time predict future patterns,\" with the ultimate goal of smart devices - such as \"smart\" street lamps - making emergency calls to the authorities, as opposed to human beings.\n\nData obtained from these software products, which are slated to be adopted nationwide as part of a new national \"next generation\" 911 system, are shared with the same law enforcement agencies now implementing the Barr-designed \"national disruption and early engagement program\" to target individuals flagged as potentially violent based on vague criteria. Combined with the \"domestic terror\" framework released during the Biden administration, the definition of \"domestic terrorists\" now encompasses those who oppose US government overreach and those who oppose any form of capitalism, including the World Economic Forum-favored \"stakeholder capitalism,\" and/or \"corporate globalization.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, during this same period, also mulled the creation of a new health-focused agency modeled after DARPA. The proposed \"HARPA\", which was promoted extensively to Trump by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka as well as Trump's close friend and former NBCUniversal president Bob Wright. HARPA's proposed flagship program - \"SAFE HOME\" (Stopping Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome Mental Extremes) - would use \"breakthrough technologies with high specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric violence,\" specifically \"advanced analytical tools based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\" The program would have cost an estimated $60 million over four years and would use data from Americans' social media accounts as well as \"Apple Watches, Fitbits, Amazon Echo and Google Home\" and other consumer electronic devices. The program would also collect information provided by health-care providers to identify who may be a \"threat.\"\n\nThough HARPA was not created under the Trump administration, Trump reportedly reacted \"very positively\" to the proposal and was \"sold on the concept.\" In addition, before the proposal was known publicly, Trump had called on Big Tech, and specifically social media to collaborate with the DOJ to create software that stops mass murders before they happen by detecting potential mass shooters before they can act. However, Trump ultimately passed on creating HARPA, which was ultimately created during the Biden administration as ARPA-H, underscoring the bipartisan nature of this agenda.\n\nAre Peter Thiel-Backed Intelligence Contractors \"MAGA\"?\n\nDespite many Thiel-backed or Thiel-founded companies describing themselves as \"America First\" and as defenders of \"Western values,\" a closer examination of those companies suggests this is not the case. One lesser known example of this is Palantir's early role in developing a way for the US government to target Julian Assange, leaks-based journalism in the public interest, and what it called \"The WikiLeaks Threat.\" In looking at other Thiel-linked firms, it's quite clear that at least some are more than willing to target Americans on either side of the political divide on behalf of their biggest client, the so-called \"Deep State\" that Trump supporters revile. Take, for example, the Thiel-backed Clearview AI - which claims to now be able to identify every person in the world using its advanced facial recognition system. As Unlimited Hangout contributor Stavroula Pabst noted in a recent report:\n\nWhen asked in an NBC interview about Clearview AI's possible negative ramifications for society, the company's CEO, Hoan Ton-That, said '[a] lot of peoples' minds on facial recognition technology were changed around Jan. 6th, when the insurrection happened [at the United States Capitol Building]. It was very instrumental in being able to make identifications quickly.'\n\nAs its own CEO stated, Clearview AI was used extensively on January 6th and later boasted of its \"potential for identifying rioters at the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\" In a 2023 interview, New York Times reporter Kashmir Hill added that, not only was Clearview AI used at the Capitol that day, but also in the days and weeks that followed to identify alleged rioters:\n\nThe FBI had photos of all these people because many of them were filming themselves on social media and posting photos online, and they weren't wearing masks. And so many police departments started running their photos through Clearview AI to identify them.\n\nAfter the events of January 6th, 2021, Clearview AI reported a 26 percent uptake of its services from law enforcement, having used its role in targeting Trump supporters as a sales pitch.\n\nClearview AI is not the only Thiel-linked company willing to target Trump's base, as Palantir's co-founder and current CEO Alex Karp is obsessed with his long-time fear that the \"far right\" is going to murder him for his ethnic background. That fear, per Karp, \"propels a lot of the decisions\" made at Palantir. \"I still can't believe I haven't been shot and pushed out the window,\" Karp told New York Times reporter Michael Steinberger in 2020. Steinberger added that \"if the far right came to power, [Karp] said, he would certainly be among its victims. 'Who's the first person who is going to get hung? You make a list, and I will show you who they get first. It's me. There's not a box I don't check.'\"\n\nThen, in 2023, Karp stated during an interview at the World Economic Forum annual meeting that \"We built PG [proprietary software], which single-handedly stopped the rise of the far-right in Europe.\" Given that the labels \"far right\" as well as \"far left\" are often misused to describe those on either side of the political spectrum that do not subscribe to or support official narratives, it's worth asking if the \"far right\" Karp claims to have stopped referred to people who actually deserve the label, or right-leaning populism, given populism of any flavor is a threat to Palantir's benefactors in the corporate world and in the US National Security community.\n\nIn addition, Trump supporters that did not subscribe to official narratives around Covid-19-era policies should be aware of Palantir's role in the Trump administration's Covid response and also in the Covid vaccination roll-out. During Covid, Palantir developed Tiberius, which was used by HHS to \"help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccine each state will receive\" and also to \"decide where every allocated dose will go - from local doctors' offices to large medical centers.\" Tiberius, and by extension Palantir, collected all the Covid-19 and healthcare data from US government agencies, local and state governments, pharmaceutical firms, vaccine manufacturers and companies contracted to act as vaccine distributers. Palantir was also provided Americans' sensitive health information by the Trump-era HHS as well as \"a wide range of demographic, employment and public health data sets\" in order to \"help identify high-priority populations\" to receive the vaccine first. During Covid, Palantir was also a member of the Covid-19 Health Coalition, whose other members included the CIA's In-Q-Tel, which was Palantir's first funder, as well as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\n\nPalantir also managed the HHS Protect database, a secretive database that hoarded (and still hoards) information related to the spread of Covid-19 gathered from \"more than 225 data sets, including demographic statistics, community-based tests, and a wide range of state-provided data.\" At the time, HHS Protect was criticized by several public health experts and epidemiologists, among others, because of the sudden decision by the Trump-era HHS to force US hospitals to provide all data on COVID-19 cases and patient information directly to HHS Protect and, thus, to Palantir. Hospitals were threatened with the loss of Medicare or Medicaid funding if they declined to regularly feed all of their COVID-19 patient data and test results into the HHS Protect database. Palantir declined to provide information on any safeguards it had in place to protect Americans' health data in any of its HHS-related programs, despite requests to do so from Senators and Congressmen. HHS Protect also later incorporated HHS Vision, an artificial intelligence-driven \"predictive\" component, which \"uses prewritten algorithms to simulate behaviors and forecast possible outcomes.\" Aspects of HHS Protect share remarkable similarities with the scrapped TIA sub-program known as \"Bio-surveillance.\"\n\nPalantir's Tiberius, Race, and the Public Health Panopticon The controversial data mining firm, whose history and rise has long been inextricably linked with the CIA and the national security state, will now use its software to identify and prioritize the same minority groups that it has long oppressed on behalf of the US military and US intelligence.\n\nNot only that, but a long-time consultant to Palantir, Avril Haines, was a key fixture at the controversial pandemic \"simulation\" in late 2019 that was tied to previous, intelligence-linked biosecurity events like the 2001 anthrax attacks. Haines, a former CIA deputy director, worked very closely with her superior, John Brennan, at the CIA, including during the time Brennan illegally surveilled Trump associates during the 2016 election cycle and helped propagate and develop the \"Russiagate\" narrative, which Haines is now conveniently resurrecting. Haines, shortly after participating in Event 201, joined the Biden administration and has been serving as the administration's top intelligence official - the Director of National Intelligence - since Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nPalantir is also controversial among the America left for its role in using big data to facilitate ICE raids on migrants and its decision to pilot its \"predictive policing\", i.e. pre-crime, functionality in low-income, minority communities. Ultimately, Palantir - like many of the other military/intelligence contractors with close ties to Peter Thiel - is a tool of the National Security State, which has been ramping up its \"War on Domestic Terror\" apparatus that - per government documentation - will target dissent on both left and right and essentially anyone who attempts to stand, or even speak, against government overreach and criminality.\n\nWith Thiel, Palantir and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale now pumping millions into the Trump-Vance campaign after the recent VP announcement, it seems almost inevitable that Palantir and the other Thiel-linked military contractors will have even more influence in a second Trump administration than it did during his first term.\n\nArticle posted with permission from Whitney Webb\n\nWhitney Webb Whitney Webb is a MintPress News journalist based in Chile.

And Vance is one more link in the chain", "body": "Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, a longtime backer of the new vice-president pick, are among those pledging support\n\nLess than a month after Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016, he invited the cream of Silicon Valley's tech elite to a meeting at his transition team's headquarters at Trump Tower.\n\nIt was an awkward affair. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Google's Larry Page and Amazon's Jeff Bezos had facial expressions that ranged from a semi-rictus grin to full tech-mogul-in-a-hostage-situation. But then, in a sense they were. There was a new sheriff in town - and none of them had seen him coming.\n\nBut one person was in his element. Seated next to Trump, uncomplicatedly beaming, was a South African-born tech entrepreneur whose early investment in Facebook had made him billions.\n\nThis was Peter Thiel. And if this past week marked an inflection point, and there are many reasons to believe it did, the seeds of it were planted in the summer of 2016. This was when Trump was the outside candidate. The man no respectable west coast tech entrepreneur or east coast business elite wanted to touch.\n\nLast week marked a decisive end to that era. A week in which Donald Trump not only appointed a tech bro to be his second in command, choosing Senator JD Vance to be his VP, but in which he received the benediction of the tech bro-in-chief, Elon Musk.\n\nMusk has said he will donate $45m a month to Trump's campaign, though his ongoing endorsement on X, the platform he bought and owns, is worth countless millions more.\n\nBut it's some lesser-known figures in Silicon Valley who last week boarded the Trump bandwagon who are perhaps even more telling. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who own one of the most storied and influential venture capital (VC) firms in Silicon Valley, have declared they're all in for Trump alongside a host of lesser-known but important names who have either followed suit or who beat them to the punch, including the Winklevoss twins and investors and podcast hosts Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks.\n\nBack in 2016, Peter Thiel was the voice in the wilderness. And in that meeting in Trump Tower, it was Thiel's hand that Trump picked up and stroked. (And whose data mining firm, Palantir, picked up billions of dollars in contracts from Trump's Department of Defense, and, most controversially, Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, where it profiled and surveilled migrants.)\n\nThe principle that underpins Silicon Valley investing is to bet early and bet big. It worked for Thiel with Facebook. It worked for Thiel with Trump. And last week another of his bets paid off, though few could ever have predicted how spectacularly.\n\nBecause JD Vance, the new potential VP, is Thiel's creature. He is a man Thiel moulded in his own image through lavish investments in his business and political careers. Thiel gave Vance a job at his VC firm, Mithril Capital, backed him to start his own venture fund, Narya Capital, then later invested $15m in his successful run for the senate. Max Chafkin, Thiel's biographer, describes Vance as his \"extension\".\n\nThe payoff from Thiel's early gamble in Trump is a lesson that has not passed others by. As with their other obsession, crypto, the best time to have invested in Trump was 2016, and the second best time is today. We already have a word for what we're watching now: it's oligarchy. And we've already seen how this plays out. In Putin's Russia, political and commercial interests are one and the same.\n\nThiel is betting - again - on the same phenomenon in America. Betting that he will be first among a new breed of tech bro oligarchs - a new super-class of broligarchs.\n\nIn Trump's America, there will be hard choices for everyone, including the billionaires. Though it may be less hard for them. Vance has said he wants to deregulate crypto and unshackle AI. He's said he'd dismantle Biden's attempts to place safeguards around AI development.\n\nAnd while he has it in for the legacy monopolies of Google and Facebook - the platforms that his ideological bedfellows in the \"new right\" see as part of the \"censorship industrial complex\" suffocating rightwing speech - Silicon Valley is betting on a gloves-off, regulation-free, pro-business goldrush.\n\nAnother Peter Thiel acolyte was on stage at the Republican National Convention last week, electrifying the crowd: Hulk Hogan. Hogan is less well known as one of Thiel's longterm bets, though in some ways he's even more instructive than Vance. In 2007, the online magazine Gawker outed Thiel and ran a series of unflattering articles about him. It took him years, but he ultimately got his revenge, covertly funding Hulk Hogan to the tune of $10m to sue the publication for invasion of privacy and forcing it into bankruptcy.\n\nOn stage at the RNC, the wrestler, a permatanned orange, ripped off his shirt for the man who increasingly looks like he'll be America's next president. Or, if JD Vance, is correct, the man who will prove to be the Caesar he says America needs. A man who he has already urged to fire the nation's civil servants to \"replace them with our people\", to defy the courts and rule his own way. Or, to put this in simple terms: to foment a coup.\n\nThiel knows what every investor knows. That a crisis is an opportunity. And that if Trump succeeds in tearing up the federal administration, there is not only billions to be made in the ensuing market turmoil but that a new breed of oligarchs, close to Caesar's throne, will be the first to share the spoils.\n\nAnd chief among them will be Thiel. It's not a stretch to see how Palantir, his data-mining company - that under the Conservatives got its teeth into the NHS - will profile and surveil and target Caesar's enemies.

So, who is JD Vance and why did Trump pick him as his running mate? and most importantly, will Vance be as much of a weasel as Mike Pence was?\n\nHere's what the media won't tell you about JD Vance.\n\nJust to let y'all know my bias, right out of the gate, because everyone has a bias:\n\nI think, even though the whole shooter narrative they've given us is unbelievable, at best, you got to give it to him: Trump looked pretty cool, pumping his fist after his assassination attempt and it stirred feelings of Red, White and Blue, Andrew Jackson dueling absolutely anybody who looked at him the wrong way, eating a Publix sub, right on the beach, the sound of Eagle cries. You get it.\n\nBut on the other hand, I despise Operation Warp Speed and my memory isn't that short and I also despise the people who Trump has chosen to surround himself with in the past. And I know the bottom line, which is that American politics are controlled by anti-American interests; corporations, secret societies but I believe in the country America used to be; the country it could become, if American interests were put first, if we took back our monetary system from the Federal Reserve if our troops were brought back from the \"Forever Wars\" to secure our border.\n\nAnd I'm paying attention, because I'm interested in Trump's last president trajectory as detailed over a 100 Years Ago, by Ingersoll Lockwood and I'm curious if there will even be an election, at all.\n\nSo, 39-year-old JD Vance, unlike most politicians, Vance wasn't born into wealth and Fortune but into a working class Irish Scottish family. His childhood was marked by his mother's struggles with addiction and a revolving door of father figures.\n\nLuckily, he had his grandparents', who played a key role in his upbringing.\n\nAfter High School, he enlisted in the US Marine Corps and served in Iraq after 4 years of service to his country.\n\nHe graduated from Ohio State University after which he attended Yale Law School.\n\nAnd it wouldn't be a video of mine if I didn't dunk on every politician who attended Yale, because of their Bonesman secret society association and the sexual blackmail associated with it - it's a presidential machine - but as far as I can tell, Vance never did the Skull and Bones thing while at Yale\n\nYale, like Harvard and other Ivy Leagues serves as a government recruitment center for alphabet agencies and networking opportunities with the upper echelon.\n\nVance actually met his wife, Usha, daughter of Indian immigrants while they were both students at Yale Law.\n\nUsha clerked for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the DC Circuit and also, Chief Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court, after graduating from Yale Law School. So she seems pretty well-connected for being a First-Generation American.\n\nThe California legal firm, Munger Tolsen Olssen, which calls its culture \"Radically Progressive\" employed Usha from 2015 to 2017 and The New York Times said that she was a Registered Democrat until 2014.\n\nAccording reports, JD and Usha had a mixed-faith marriage ceremony, as he's Christian and she's Hindu and JD and Usha have three children together.\n\nAfter graduating from Law School in 2013, Vance worked briefly as a law clerk for like, 1 second before becoming a principal at Peter Thiel's Venture Capital firm, Mithril Capital Management.\n\nMithril Capital is not directly affiliated with the CIA but its co-founder, Peter Thiel has connections to Palantir Technologies, which received investment from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm.\n\nGovernment institutions use Palantir Technologies as data analysis tools, artificial intelligence, spying and data collection. Palantir is still listed as a Mithril company on their website.\n\nI'll link my video on enq below if you're interested.\n\nIt all boils down to this: Vance worked for a CIA contractor at a CIA contractor company before getting into politics.\n\nI also just want to note that Peter Thiel is closely linked to Elon Musk from his time at PayPal and Thiel is constantly in the whole Joe Rogan sphere of influence\n\nThiel is not my favorite guy. He's like his gay, conservative Silicon Valley guy getting blood infusions from teenagers for the purposes of life extension - and, hey your business partner your boss isn't your personality - okay I get that. It wouldn't matter if that's all he was to JD Vance - but instead, JD Vance received considerable funding from Peter Thiel. He donated $15 million to Vance's 2022 Senate race super pac.\n\nBut we're getting ahead of ourselves, OK, because, you know, I like to stick to the timeline and we got to talk about Vance during Trump's first presidency:\n\n(Roll video of Vance dissing Trump)\n\n\"I'm a never-Trump guy. I never liked him as somebody who doesn't like Trump, I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton. I didn't vote for Trump.\n\n'Hillbilly Elegy' was JD Vance's first memoir, that came out in 2016 [when Vance was only 31]. Many people loved the book, because they felt like it told the truth about Vance's difficult childhood and a poor white working class family in the Rust Belt - while other folks hated his memoir, because of the nsulting stereotypes.\n\nThe main point of he book was to show how bad things are for the white working class in America and how people need to take responsibility to get help from their communities and change the system, as a whole to fix these problems so they can ultimately achieve the American Dream through hard work.\n\nThere was a whole Netflix adaptation of the book so we should have known Vance was going to come Center Stage, sooner or later.\n\nThe whole publication of this memoir really bolstered his career and gave him a voice in the political sphere during the 2016 presidential race. JD Vance was openly critical of Donald Trump. Vance was a never Trumper with Orange Man Derangement Syndrome and came off as pro-Hillary.\n\nHowever, over time, apparently Vance changed his mind, which I just want to say, immediately struck me as unbelievable. But then again, I do know people in real life who were like this; Never-Trumpers or liberals who changed teams at some point. It can happen, apparently.\n\nVance had gotten Trump's support before he ran for Senate in 2021 and of course, Trump's endorsement gave his campaign a big boost and helped them win the race - which I told you, he would not have won had it not been for Peter Thiel's donation.\n\nNow, I want to get into the part about Vance that I'll get memory-holed and never reported by media, because hey were compliant with these issues the entire time - but it is of note to me, at least - and maybe to you, that Vance was pro-vaxxine but anti-mandates.\n\n(Roll video montage of Vance c. 2021 responding to media about the vaxx)\n\nHe wrote some very sarcastic tweets about the mandates, which I think are being screenshotted and misconstrued.\n\nIt appears Vance is very pro-Israel he did the whole ritual, that all of our politicians do, by going to the Western Wall and wearing the small hat and has publicly stated that \"Israel is one of the United States' most important allies\".\n\nAnd y'all - I understand that the barrier for entry to American politics is pledging allegiance to Israel - I get it - but it's like, these things never get discussed and get swept under the rug - like, your children won't get drafted for the military and sent to their deaths over the constant war crimes in the Middle East.\n\nSo, it needs to be Loud and Proud and Understood: you're either America First or your Israel First. You can't serve two masters. It just don't work like that.\n\nOn the issue of Ukraine, Vance stated: \"I got to be honest with you, I don't really care what happens to Ukraine, one way or the other.\"\n\nI think the general sentiment - at least around here -is American politicians should care about America First and stop sending our tax dollars to foreign countries.\n\nAlso of note, Vance believes abortion is a State issue and wants to ban gender-affirming care for minors and he supports building a wall along the southern border.\n\nMitt Romney was also quoted as, \"I don't know that I can disrespect someone more than I do JD Vance,\" and this was over Vance flip-flopping on Trump - and you know, by now that on this channel, we thoroughly disrespect Mitt Romney, because he's a fake Mormon and Bain Company stooge who was BFFs with Netanyahu at Boston Consulting. I've done videos on him that I'll link below. So, if Mitt Romney doesn't like Vance, maybe Vance is, at least a decent person.\n\n(Roll video of Vance on Trump's campaign trail in New Hampshire, responding to a question from the audience about the truth of January 6th)\n\nJD Vance: That's a very good - that's, that's maybe the most important thing that he [Trump] needs to do, when he's elected President. Look, we still don't know who planted the pipe bomb at the RNC. Do you remember that? That was headline news for all of about 4 hours, okay? A pipe bomb was planted, we have video of it and the FBI guy is more concerned about a 70-year-old grandmother who was walking through the halls of the Capitol than a person who apparently tried to blow up the RNC.\n\nUnlike Mike Pence, Vance raised money for people jailed on January 6th. He's also, according to reports anti-seed oils and pro-nicotine.\n\nVance disclosed owning nearly $200,000 of Bitcoin in 2022.\n\nSo: pro-crypto currency and also reportedly owns Rumble stock. He's also self-admittedly plugged into a lot of weird right-wing subcultures, which just means he's online a lot.\n\nSo, to summarize, in the face of mass criticism about both candidates being up-there in age, Trump picked a white guy in his 30s as a running mate to refresh his campaign.\n\nThe Optics on Vance are that he appears to be an American First Good Ole Boy from the Rust Belt. And while I'm not 100% sold on that pitch, I understand the posturing.\n\nVance's age and inexperience in politics gives the Trump campaign their assassination insurance and it also gives them a future for the MAGA party, because they need someone to run in 2028.\n\nWill JD Vance be better than Mike Pence? You tell me, Internet Friends.\n\nWas I fair was I fair to this VP pick? I tried to be. Let me know your thoughts, Internet Friends. You know I always look forward to your comments.", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Thiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palantir Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skull and Bones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secret society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yale Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Warp Speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Americanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who own one of the most storied and influential venture capital (VC) firms in Silicon Valley, have declared they're all in for Trump alongside a host of lesser-known but important names who have either followed suit or who beat them to the punch, including the Winklevoss twins and investors and podcast hosts Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks.\n\nBack in 2016, Peter Thiel was the voice in the wilderness. And in that meeting in Trump Tower, it was Thiel's hand that Trump picked up and stroked. (And whose data mining firm, Palantir, picked up billions of dollars in contracts from Trump's Department of Defense, and, most controversially, Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, where it profiled and surveilled migrants.) The principle that underpins Silicon Valley investing is to bet early and bet big. It worked for Thiel with Facebook. It worked for Thiel with Trump. And last week another of his bets paid off, though few could ever have predicted how spectacularly.\n\nBecause JD Vance, the new potential VP, is Thiel's creature. He is a man Thiel moulded in his own image through lavish investments in his business and political careers. Thiel gave Vance a job at his VC firm, Mithril Capital, backed him to start his own venture fund, Narya Capital, then later invested $15m in his successful run for the senate. Max Chafkin, Thiel's biographer, describes Vance as his \"extension\". The payoff from Thiel's early gamble in Trump is a lesson that has not passed others by. As with their other obsession, crypto, the best time to have invested in Trump was 2016, and the second best time is today. We already have a word for what we're watching now: it's oligarchy. And we've already seen how this plays out. In Putin's Russia, political and commercial interests are one and the same.\n\nThiel is betting - again - on the same phenomenon in America. Betting that he will be first among a new breed of tech bro oligarchs - a new super-class of broligarchs. In Trump's America, there will be hard choices for everyone, including the billionaires. Though it may be less hard for them. Vance has said he wants to deregulate crypto and unshackle AI. He's said he'd dismantle Biden's attempts to place safeguards around AI development. And while he has it in for the legacy monopolies of Google and Facebook - the platforms that his ideological bedfellows in the \"new right\" see as part of the \"censorship industrial complex\" suffocating rightwing speech - Silicon Valley is betting on a gloves-off, regulation-free, pro-business goldrush.\n\nEDIT\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/20/tech-broligarchs-court-trump-vance-elon-musk-peter-thiel", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Thiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David O.

According to Axios, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and venture capitalist David Sacks personally lobbied Donald Trump to choose JD Vance as his running mate. The 39-year-old Ohio senator was announced as the GOP nominee for Vice President of the United States on Monday.\n\nMike Allen, Axios co-founder, wrote in the publication's newsletter that Trump had confided in friends about his decision to pick Vance several days before the announcement. However, Vance only learned he would be Trump's running mate moments before the former president shared the news on Truth Social, according to multiple sources speaking to CNN.\n\nThe other two contenders, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Marco Rubio, were reportedly informed around midday on Monday. Axios revealed that a secret lobbying effort, led by influential figures like Musk, Carlson, and Sacks, persisted until Monday morning, but the publication did not detail their involvement. Business Insider could not verify the report.\n\nCNN reported that Carlson supported Vance, believing he would resonate with working-class voters, while Rupert Murdoch, Carlson's former boss at Fox News, lobbied for Burgum.\n\nWhen Tucker Carlson heard a few weeks ago that former President Donald J. Trump might be reconsidering J.D. Vance as his running mate, he stepped in. During a speaking tour in Australia, Carlson called Trump with a dire warning.\n\nAccording to two sources cited in a New York Times article detailing Vance's long journey to winning Trump over, Carlson's June phone call was intense. He told Trump that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another leading contender for the vice-presidential slot, was untrustworthy and would lead America into nuclear war. Carlson also expressed distrust for another contender, Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota.\n\nCarlson warned Trump that choosing a \"neocon\" -- Republicans who support using U.S. power to spread democracy abroad -- as his VP would make U.S. intelligence agencies see Trump as a threat, potentially leading to assassination attempts to install their preferred president.\n\nAdditionally, Carlson cautioned Trump against taking advice from allies of Rupert Murdoch, his former employer. \"When your enemies are pushing a running mate on you,\" Carlson said, referencing the Murdoch empire, \"it's a pretty good sign you should ignore them.\"\n\nElon Musk also played a pivotal role in persuading Donald Trump to select J.D. Vance as his running mate. Musk, along with other influential tech figures, actively lobbied for Vance, emphasizing the strategic advantages that aligned with their interests. Following an assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania, Musk argued that Vance's appointment would act as \"assassination insurance,\" underscoring Vance's reliability and alignment with Trump's agenda.Musk's influence in this decision was bolstered by his significant presence and advocacy on social media, where he expressed strong support for Vance. This effort was part of a larger campaign by several tech billionaires who viewed Vance as a candidate capable of promoting policies beneficial to the tech industry.\n\nWhy Big Tech loves JD Vance\n\nJ.D. Vance, the 39-year-old Ohio senator and recent GOP nominee for Vice President of the United States, has garnered significant support from big tech and influential Silicon Valley figures. This endorsement is not coincidental but rooted in Vance's deep connections to the tech industry and his alignment with its key players, notably Peter Thiel. Vance's relationship with Silicon Valley dates back to his early career. Before entering politics, he worked in the tech industry and became a prominent figure through his venture capital firm, Narya Capital, which he co-founded with backing from Peter Thiel. Thiel, a billionaire tech investor and co-founder of PayPal, has been a mentor and major supporter of Vance, providing both financial backing and strategic advice.\n\nPeter Thiel's influence on Vance's career cannot be overstated. Thiel, known for his contrarian views and substantial impact on the tech world, saw potential in Vance early on. Thiel's investment in Narya Capital not only gave Vance a platform to engage with Silicon Valley's elite but also positioned him as a key player in the venture capital scene. This association has significantly boosted Vance's credibility and influence within the tech community. One of the primary reasons big tech supports Vance is his ideological alignment with the industry's visionaries. Vance shares Thiel's skepticism of unchecked government power and his belief in the potential of technology to drive societal change. This perspective resonates with many in Silicon Valley who view innovation and entrepreneurship as vital to America's future.\n\nVance's policy positions also align with the interests of the tech sector. He advocates for deregulation, which appeals to tech companies looking for fewer constraints on their operations. Additionally, his stance on issues like data privacy and digital infrastructure development is in line with the goals of many tech giants aiming to expand their influence and capabilities. Beyond the boardrooms and investment firms, Vance's appeal extends to tech workers. His background and narrative, especially his rise from a modest upbringing to success in Silicon Valley, mirror the aspirations of many in the tech industry. His bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which details his journey, resonates with those who see technology as a pathway to upward mobility.\n\nThe recent lobbying efforts by tech titans like Elon Musk and David Sacks to position Vance as Trump's running mate highlight the strategic importance of having a tech-savvy individual in a high governmental role. These figures recognize that Vance's potential influence in the White House could lead to policies favorable to the tech industry, promoting innovation, and ensuring America's competitive edge in the global tech race. In essence, J.D. Vance is a favored candidate in Silicon Valley due to his deep-rooted connections with influential tech figures like Peter Thiel, his ideological alignment with the tech sector's vision, and his policy perspectives that promise to foster a conducive environment for technological advancement. As he steps onto the national stage, Vance represents not just a political figure but a bridge between Washington and Silicon Valley, embodying the aspirations and interests of the tech industry.\n\nWho is Elon Musk?\n\nElon Musk is a renowned entrepreneur, inventor, and CEO of several groundbreaking companies.

The Ohio senator's selection as Donald Trump's running mate has been celebrated by American First and \"Restrainer\" groups, even as it has panicked liberal internationalists and supporters of the trans-Atlantic community.\n\nTo ask, \"What does JD Vance believe\" is to make a category error. The better question is, \"What beliefs will JD Vance espouse in order to draw closer to power?\"\n\nSince Vance abandoned his \"Never Trump\" posture after 2017, he has taken every opportunity to endear himself to Trump and even to offer a kind of intellectual scaffolding for MAGA foreign policy. There is little reason to believe that Vance would provide a meaningful voice for restraint (on any issue other than Ukraine) in a Trump White House, or that he is interested in a long-term revision of U.S. foreign policy priorities.\n\nBut Vance's principled commitment to \"restraint\" is mostly wishful thinking among a set of pundits seeking political relevance.\n\nLike the vast bulk of his Republican brethren, Vance is a strong supporter of Israel and of Israel's war in Gaza. He has argued that the United States has a critical role in establishing a balancing coalition against Iran in the Middle East. Vance has consistently supported a hard line against Iran, having expressed outright admiration for Trump's decision to assassinate Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and has even described his late-found opposition to the Iraq War in terms of Iran's growing regional influence. Vance has expressed few, if any, qualms about the size of the defense budget or the influence of the defense industrial base on American politics.\n\nCloser to home, Vance is an enthusiastic supporter of the notion that the U.S. military should play an active role in the war on drugs, up to and including direct military intervention in Mexico. Vance has positioned himself as a China hawk, and in the past has argued for a security commitment to Taiwan that feels much more like President Joe Biden's foreign policy than Trump's. Vance would likely abandon that commitment for tactical reasons -- Trump has suggested that the U.S. relationship with Taiwan should be transactional rather than categorical -- but this simply serves to illustrate Vance's ideological flexibility.\n\nVance has displayed the kind of skepticism of the national security state that is now common in MAGA circles, but this has less to do with any principled non-interventionism than it does with concern that career national security bureaucrats are unenthusiastic about Trump. Given Vance's enthusiasm for prosecuting the domestic components of the \"deep state,\" it seems possible that one of his early tasks in a second Trump administration would be to discipline the intelligence community and force it into conformity with Trump's foreign policy perspective.\n\nBut some of his commitments seem genuine. He seems genuinely impressed by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and he seems interested in doing business with Putin, a vision of great-power relations that is fundamentally transactional rather than ideological. Indeed, Vance seems particularly animated by hostility towards U.S. support for Ukraine's defensive war against Russia. Vance is evidently unburdened by the need to make his claims about Ukraine accord with objective reality, and has repeatedly claimed that the war represents a dire threat of escalation and a significant burden on the American economy.\n\nThe influence of Silicon Valley money seems apparent on this question; Vance is a favorite of Silicon Valley conservatives such as Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and David Sacks; Sacks in particular has demonstrated extraordinary hostility towards Ukrainian aspirations. Much of this rather peculiar ideological commitment seems to have something to do with the perceived \"anti-wokeness\" of the Russian regime, which is also a value that Vance has embraced.\n\nJD Vance is a political chameleon. He has rapidly built an impressive career in American politics, earning notoriety and acclaim from his book, support from tech overlords such as Thiel and Sacks, and now the acceptance of the MAGA world. But no one, including his patrons and his co-ideologists, should make the mistake of trusting him.\n\nVance is flexible, which is a polite way of saying that he is full of it. In pursuit of power he is happy to lie about his people, his past, his principles and his ideology. Thiel and Sacks and the Quincy Institute may come to regret the faith that they have invested in him. Realists and restrainers may discover that they have abandoned Ukraine only to invade Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Silvia Izquierdo/Associated Press\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO -- Madonna put on a free concert on Copacabana beach Saturday night, turning Rio de Janeiro's vast stretch of sand into an enormous dance floor teeming with a multitude of her fans.\n\nIt was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London.\n\nThe \"Queen of Pop\" began the show with her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters.\" Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nMadonna performed her classic hits, including \"Like A Virgin\" and \"Hung Up.\" For the introduction to \"Like A Prayer,\" her head was completely covered in a black cape, a rosary gripped in her hands.\n\nThe star paid an emotional tribute to \"all the bright lights\" lost to AIDS as she sang \"Live to Tell,\" with black and white photos of people who died from the illness flashing behind her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, she was joined on stage by Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar.\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall's tourism agency. That is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees could hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would bring $57 million into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state - approximately 1,555 miles from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\" cocktails. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on standby. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.\n\nAna Beatriz Soares, a fan who was at Copacabana on Saturday, said Madonna has made her mark across the decades.\n\n\"Madonna had to run so that today's pop artists could walk. That's why she's important because she serves as an inspiration for today's pop divas,\" Soares said.\n\n\"And that's 40 years ago. Not 40 days, 40 months. It's 40 years,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Douglas Engle contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Others held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd.

That is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable.

The event injected 293M reals into the local economy, attracting fans from around the world.Madonna put on a free concert on Copacabana beach on Saturday night, turning Rio de Janeiro's vast stretch of sand into an enormous dance floor teeming with a multitude of her fans.\n\nIt was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London.\n\nThe \"Queen of Pop\" began the show with her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters.\" Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers.\n\nOthers held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nMadonna performed her classic hits, including \"Like A Virgin\" and \"Hung Up.\" For the introduction to \"Like A Prayer,\" her head was completely covered in a black cape, a rosary gripped in her hands.\n\nThe star paid an emotional tribute to \"all the bright lights\" lost to AIDS as she sang \"Live to Tell,\" with black and white photos of people who died from the illness flashing behind her.\n\nLater, she was joined on stage by Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar.\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall's tourism agency. That is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-coloured cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10.37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals (USD 57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98 per cent in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state - approximately 2,500 km (1,555 miles) from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nHeineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement.

Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers.\n\nMadonna put on a free concert on Copacabana beach on Saturday night, turning Rio de Janeiro's vast stretch of sand into an enormous dance floor teeming with a multitude of her fans.\n\nIt was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 'Queen of Pop' began the show with her 1998 hit 'Nothing Really Matters.' Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers.\n\nOthers held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nMadonna performed her classic hits, including 'Like A Virgin' and 'Hung Up.' For the introduction to 'Like A Prayer,' her head was completely covered in a black cape, a rosary gripped in her hands.\n\nThe star paid an emotional tribute to 'all the bright lights' lost to AIDS as she sang 'Live to Tell,' with black and white photos of people who died from the illness flashing behind her.\n\nLater, she was joined on stage by Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar.\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance. An estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall's tourism agency. That is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-coloured cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10.37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals (USD 57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98 per cent in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement.\n\nRio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state, approximately 2,500 km (1,555 miles) from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nHeineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \u00bfLike a Virgin\u00bf cocktails. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganisation of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nMany of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.\n\nAna Beatriz Soares, a fan who was at Copacabana on Saturday, said Madonna has made her mark across the decades.\n\n\"Madonna had to run so that today's pop artists could walk. That's why she's important because she serves as an inspiration for today's pop divas,\" Soares said.\n\n\"And that's 40 years ago. Not 40 days, 40 months.

Madonna will conclude her tour on Saturday with a free concert at Copacabana Beach.\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Madonna put on a free concert on Copacabana beach Saturday night, turning Rio de Janeiro's vast stretch of sand into an enormous dance floor teeming with a multitude of her fans.\n\nIt was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London.\n\nThe \"Queen of Pop\" began the show with her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters.\" Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others looked on from brightly lighted apartments and hotels lining the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nRio's City Hall predicted 1.5 million spectators, more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area teemedwith street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state -- approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,555 miles) from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nHeineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\" cocktails, named for her 1984 hit. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London. The \"Queen of Pop\"\u009d began the show with her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters.\"\u009d Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay. \"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\"\u009d Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\" Madonna performed her classic hits, including \"Like A Virgin\"\u009d and \"Hung Up.\"\u009d For the introduction to \"Like A Prayer,\"\u009d her head was completely covered in a black cape, a rosary gripped in her hands. The star paid an emotional tribute to \"all the bright lights\"\u009d lost to AIDS as she sang \"Live to Tell,\"\u009d with black and white photos of people who died from the illness flashing behind her. Later, she was joined on stage by Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar. Rio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance. An estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall's tourism agency. That is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career. In recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand. By midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\u009d Flags with \"Madonna\"\u009d printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun. \"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\"\u009d said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap. \"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\"\u009d said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area. Eighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule. City Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement. \"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\"\u009d said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state - approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,555 miles) from Rio. \"Welcome Queen!\"\u009d read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown. Heineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\"\u009d cocktails. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear. Organization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show. Rio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show. A number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time. Ana Beatriz Soares, a fan who was at Copacabana on Saturday, said Madonna has made her mark across the decades. \"Madonna had to run so that today's pop artists could walk. That's why she's important, because she serves as an inspiration for today's pop divas,\" Soares said. \"And that's 40 years ago. Not 40 days, 40 months. It's 40 years,\"\u009d she said. ___ AP video journalist Douglas Engle contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"},

AFP\n\nPop idol Madonna gave it all in Rio de Janeiro as she looked back on her four-decade career in a historic show before throngs of joyful fans jammed onto Brazil's famed Copacabana beach on Saturday night.\n\nThe 65-year-old singer walked down an elevated bridge from the Copacabana Palace hotel shortly after 10:30 pm (0130 GMT Sunday) to a massive stage for one of the most important shows of her career.\n\nDressed all in black, Madonna broke into her hit \"Nothing Really Matters\" at the start of a burst of brute energy.\n\n\"Rio, here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" she said at the start of a performance that brought the giddy Brazilian audience to its feet.\n\nThe show marked the final stop on her \"Celebration Tour\" noting her 40 years atop pop charts, in a free event that drew an estimated 1.6 million people from across Brazil, according to the city tourism office.\n\nFans cheer as US pop star Madonna performs during a free concert at Copacabana beach.\n\nBilled as a \"historic\" show, it blended music and dance with cabaret.\n\nLive To Tell\n\nMadonna was joined on stage during the performance of her hit \"Vogue\" by Brazilian singer Anitta, who is known for taking Carioca funk -- the soundtrack of Rio's favelas -- to the rest of the world.\n\nWith \"Live To Tell\", she paid tribute to AIDS victims, including Freddie Mercury and the legendary Brazilian musician Cazuza.\n\nUS electronic dance music master DJ Diplo opened the show as thousands jostled to get a view of the stage. Boats bobbed in the water offshore, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder was Madonna's phrase: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection in June last year.\n\nOi, Rio\n\nMadonna's concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million production cost.\n\nA crowd of fans is seen as US pop star Madonna performs during a free concert at Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAuthorities expected it would pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood were billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nHundreds of her fans swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace since her arrival on Monday.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType":

Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98 percent in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state, approximately 2,500 kilometers from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nBars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\" cocktails. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nMany of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Madonna ended her \"The Celebration Tour\" with a performance attended by some 1.5 million enthusiastic fans. Pablo PORCIUNCULA / AFP\n\nPop idol Madonna gave it all in Rio de Janeiro as she looked back on her four-decade career in a historic show before throngs of joyful fans jammed onto Brazil's famed Copacabana beach on Saturday night.\n\nThe 65-year-old singer walked down an elevated bridge from the Copacabana Palace hotel shortly after 10:30 p.m. (0130 GMT Sunday) to a massive stage for one of the most important shows of her career.\n\nDressed all in black, Madonna broke into her hit \"Nothing Really Matters\" at the start of a burst of brute energy.\n\n\"Rio, here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" she said at the start of a performance that brought the giddy Brazilian audience to its feet.\n\nThe show marked the final stop on her \"Celebration Tour\" noting her 40 years atop pop charts, in a free event that was estimated to draw upward of 1.5 million fans from across Brazil.\n\nBilled as a \"historic\" show, it blended music and dance with cabaret.\n\nMadonna showcased her versatility with dozens of set and costume changes, spectacular lights and many giant screens along the beach.\n\nShe went from being dressed as a schoolgirl in a miniskirt to an irreverent Christian in a black cape while luminous crosses circled around her during \"Like a Prayer,\" a song that cost her excommunication from the Catholic Church.\n\nLive To Tell\n\nMadonna was joined on stage during the performance of her hit \"Vogue\" by Brazilian singer Anitta, who is known for taking Carioca funk -- the soundtrack of Rio's favelas -- to the rest of the world.\n\nWith \"Live To Tell\", she paid tribute to AIDS victims, including Freddie Mercury and the legendary Brazilian musician Cazuza.\n\nUS electronic dance music master DJ Diplo opened the show as thousands jostled to get a view of the stage.\n\nBoats bobbed in the water offshore, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP.\n\nTattooed on her shoulder was Madonna's phrase: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a transgender woman, standing near the huge stage that was twice the size of any other used on the tour.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection in June last year.\n\nMadonna has released an album every two or three years since the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar.\n\nBut the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, such as when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" which was seen as blasphemous.\n\nOi, Rio!\n\nMadonna's concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million Reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million production cost.\n\nAuthorities expected it would pump a far larger sum -- 293 million Reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood were billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nHundreds of her fans swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace since her arrival on Monday.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

After 80 ticketed shows, two continents, and two lawsuits for starting late (resolutions still pending), all that was left was a free concert in Rio on May 4. And how did it go? An estimated 1.6 million people attended last Saturday's show. We'll never know how much it was the power of Madonna, the appeal of free tickets, or some combination of both. But reports indicate that the revelry was joyful in the days leading up to the concert and on the night of, when Madge took to the stage only 52 minutes late! That's basically on time for her, right? Associated Press captured highlights of the scene at Copacabana beach:\n\nMadonna takes a bow: Madonna put on a free concert on Copacabana beach Saturday night, turning Rio de Janeiro's vast stretch of sand into an enormous dance floor teeming with a multitude of her fans. ... Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay. \"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"this place is magic.\"\n\nMadge's previous audience record was broken: An estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall's tourism agency. That is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nCopacabana beach got into the groove: In recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside that stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand. ... Flags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun. ... Eighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nRio followed NYE holiday planning: Organization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show. Rio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA fan justifies her love: Ana Beatriz Soares, a fan who was at Copacabana on Saturday said Madonna has made her mark across the decades. \"Madonna had to run so that today's pop artists could walk. That's why she's important, because she serves as an inspiration for today's pop divas,\" Soares said.\n\n[From Associated Press]\n\nYou guys, I know there may be a second language issue here, but I am positively howling at the statement, \"Madonna had to run so that today's pop artists could walk.\" We have to keep it, it's too good! So instead of paving the way for artists to follow, Madonna flew high so that others could trudge after her? I think Madonna would (not so) secretly endorse this twist on the popular phrase. I can just see her going, \"Hey Gaga, I ran so you could walk!\" Anyway, it sounds like it was everything you'd want for a final show, with millions of fans excited to be there. And I guess having the concert be free somehow removed the pressure for Madge to start on time. At least that's what I'm going with.

Boats bobbed in the water offshore, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder was Madonna's phrase: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a transgender woman, standing near the huge stage that was twice the size of any other used on the tour.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection in June last year.\n\nMadonna has released an album every two or three years since the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, such as when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" which was seen as blasphemous.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nMadonna's concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million production cost.\n\nAuthorities expected it would pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood were billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nHundreds of her fans swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace since her arrival on Monday.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThat scene was repeated on Friday.\n\n\"Oi, Rio!\" she called out in Portuguese to fans.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"\n\nll/app/sn/pbt", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors":

It was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London. The \"Queen of Pop\"\u009d began the show with her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters. Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others looked on from brightly lighted apartments and hotels lining the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead. \"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\"\u009d Madonna told the crowd. \"The ocean, the mountains. Jesus, this place is magic.\" Rio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance. Rio's City Hall predicted 1.5 million spectators, more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career. In recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand. By midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\u009d Flags with \"Madonna\"\u009d printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area teemedwith street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun. \"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\"\u009d said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap. \"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\"\u009d said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area. Eighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule. City Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement. \"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\"\u009d said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state - approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,555 miles) from Rio. \"Welcome Queen!\"\u009d read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown. Heineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\"\u009d cocktails, named for her 1984 hit. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear. Organization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show. Rio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show. A number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Others looked on from brightly lighted apartments and hotels lining the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna told the crowd.\n\nPointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nRio's City Hall predicted 1.5 million spectators, more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987.\n\nMadonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. They danced on the sand during the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel.\n\nBy midday on Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying: \"Welcome, Madonna. You are the best. I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black-and-white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area teemed with street vendors, and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-coloured cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure all attendees could hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10.37pm local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals (\u00a346 million) into the local economy.\n\nHotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association.\n\nFans from Brazil, Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement.\n\nRio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights for the first week of May from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna; who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state -- approximately 1,555 miles from Rio.\n\nRSS Syndicated

Boats bobbed in the water offshore, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder was Madonna's phrase: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a transgender woman, standing near the huge stage that was twice the size of any other used on the tour.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection in June last year.\n\nMadonna has released an album every two or three years since the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, such as when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" which was seen as blasphemous.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nMadonna's concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million production cost.\n\nAuthorities expected it would pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood were billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nHundreds of her fans swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace since her arrival on Monday.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThat scene was repeated on Friday.\n\n\"Oi, Rio!\" she called out in Portuguese to fans.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"\n\nll/app/sn/pbt\n\nMore from this section\n\nArizona's Democratic governor signs a bill to repeal 1864

Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nMadonna performed her classic hits, including \"Like A Virgin\" and \"Hung Up.\" For the introduction to \"Like A Prayer,\" her head was completely covered in a black cape, a rosary gripped in her hands.\n\nThe star paid an emotional tribute to \"all the bright lights\" lost to AIDS as she sang \"Live to Tell,\" with black and white photos of people who died from the illness flashing behind her.\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall's tourism agency.\n\nThat is more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star.\n\nDuring the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies.\n\nThe area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. H\n\notel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement.\n\nRio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nMany of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star.\n\nBy midday on Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying: \"Welcome, Madonna. You are the best.

It comes after Rio de Janeiro spent the last few days readying itself for the historic performance by the Queen of Pop.\n\nRio's City Hall has said some 1.5 million spectators are anticipated, more than 10 times more than Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 in Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website has been hyping the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIt will be the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective which kicked off in October in London.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz has been palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage that's in front of her hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy about noon Saturday, hundreds of fans had gathered in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you\".\n\nFlags with Madonna printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies.

Hotel capacity is expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. And Rio's international airport forecast an extra 170 flights from May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Ceara state -- approximately 2500 km from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of a upturned bottle cap resembling a crown. Heineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement, with bars and restaurants reportedly preparing \"like a virgin\" cocktails, named for her 1984 hit. A shop in the downtown neighbourhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganisation of the mega-event will be similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for the world-famous fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there has been some concern such problems may occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan includes the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy carried out inspections of vessels that wish to position themselves at sea to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nMany spectators had come to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police cited by Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper at the time.", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "1 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@1news.co.nz", "name":

It comes after Rio de Janeiro spent the last few days readying itself for the historic performance by the \"Queen of Pop\".\n\nRio's City Hall has said some 1.5 million spectators are anticipated, more than 10 times more than Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 in Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website has been hyping the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIt will be the last show of the Celebration Tour, her first retrospective which kicked off in October in London.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz has been palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage that's in front of her hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nHundreds of fans gathered in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you\".\n\nFlags with 'Madonna' printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved footpath pattern hung from balconies. The area was teeming with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who was supporting a gold-coloured cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers have been spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show was set to start at 9.45pm local time.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert will inject 293 million reals ($96.1m) into the local economy. Hotel capacity is expected to reach 98 per cent in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. And Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights from May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Ceara state -- approximately 2500km from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of a upturned bottle cap resembling a crown. Heineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement, with bars and restaurants reportedly preparing \"Like a Virgin\" cocktails, named for her 1984 hit. A shop in the downtown neighbourhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganisation of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for the world-famous fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there has been some concern such problems may occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's Navy carried out inspections of vessels that wish to position themselves at sea to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana Beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than four million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many spectators had come to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police cited by Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper at the time.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Boats bobbed in the water offshore, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder was Madonna's phrase: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a transgender woman, standing near the huge stage that was twice the size of any other used on the tour.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection in June last year.\n\nMadonna has released an album every two or three years since the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, such as when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" which was seen as blasphemous.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nMadonna's concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million production cost.\n\nAuthorities expected it would pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood were billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nHundreds of her fans swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace since her arrival on Monday.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThat scene was repeated on Friday.\n\n\"Oi, Rio!\" she called out in Portuguese to fans.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"\n\nll/app/sn/pbt\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com",

Boats bobbed in the water offshore,\n\nletting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\"\n\n29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder was\n\nMadonna's phrase: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and\n\nchange my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a transgender woman,\n\nstanding near the huge stage that was twice the size of any other used on the\n\ntour.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert\n\nprovided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the\n\nsinger suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection in June last year.\n\nMadonna has released an album every two or three years since the 1984 release\n\nof \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-\n\nprovocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, such as when she\n\nkissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church,\n\nwith Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989\n\nvideo \"Like a Prayer,\" which was seen as blasphemous.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nMadonna's concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed\n\n20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million production cost.\n\nAuthorities expected it would pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or\n\n$57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood were billboards, souvenirs or\n\nT-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean\n\nPaul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nHundreds of her fans swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace since her arrival\n\non Monday.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a\n\nsound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen\n\nMadonna!\"", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Others looked on from brightly lighted apartments and hotels lining the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead.\n\nPointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nRio's City Hall predicted 1.5 million spectators, more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987.\n\nMadonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. They danced on the sand during the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel.\n\nBy midday on Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying: \"Welcome, Madonna. You are the best. I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black-and-white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area teemed with street vendors, and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-coloured cone bra and a black cap.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure all attendees could hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10.37pm local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals (\u00a346 million) into the local economy.\n\nHotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association.\n\nFans from Brazil, Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement.\n\nRio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights for the first week of May from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna; who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state -- approximately 1,555 miles from Rio.", "source": {"uri":

Over 1.6 million fans came to see Madonna's concert on Saturday, which broke a record for the largest concert for a stand-alone show by any artist. The concert was also broadcast live on the Brazilian network Globo TV.\n\nWhile performing in Brazil, Madonna brought out two of the country's top artists as special guests. Brazil's premier drag pop star Pabllo Vittar joined Madonna onstage during her performance of \"Music.\" Vittar later reflected on Instagram about the experience of performing a samba-infused version of the Madonna classic. \"I love you Madonna,\" she wrote in the caption of her post.\n\nMadonna's second special guest was Brazilian superstar Anitta. She brought out the \"Envolver\" hit-maker during her performance of \"Vogue.\" Madonna and Anitta judged her dancers on the runway in the style of the queer ballroom scene. Anitta also shared words on Instagram about her time with Madonna.\n\n\"Yesterday was a historical night for my city Rio de Janeiro,\" she wrote. \"Madonna finished her tour at the Copacabana beach for more than 1 million people. Such a special time for all of us. I feel really honored you invited me to be part of this moment. You represent the freedom of a whole community that yesterday celebrated together your victory.\"", "source": {"uri": "remezcla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Remezcla"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_villa@remezcla.com", "name": "Lucas Villa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Globo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TV Globo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabllo_Vittar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pabllo Vittar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anitta (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ball culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://remezcla.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1736271104.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 79, "textEnd": 84}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London.\n\nThe \"Queen of Pop\" began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters. Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others looked on from brightly lighted apartments and hotels lining the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\" Rio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nRio's City Hall predicted 1.5 million spectators, more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand. By midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area teemedwith street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nHeineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\" cocktails, named for her 1984 hit. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs, and even underwear.\n\nOrganization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio State's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on standby. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Madonna's official website has been hyping the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career.\n\nIt will be the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective which kicked off in October in London.\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nREAD MORE: She's known as Ricciardo's girlfriend but she's F1 royalty in her own right\n\nREAD MORE: Huge news for Australian ABBA fans\n\nIn recent days, the buzz has been palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage that's in front of her hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy about noon on Saturday (overnight in Australia), hundreds of fans had gathered in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with 'Madonna' printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was teeming with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who was supporting a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers have been spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show is set to start at 9:45pm local time.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert will inject 293 million reals (approx. $87 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity is expected to reach 98 per cent in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. And Rio's international airport forecast an extra 170 flights from May 1 to 6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\nREAD MORE: Bindi Irwin's emotional endometriosis message to millions\n\nREAD MORE: Kevin Spacey denies new allegations of inappropriate behaviour\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Ceara state - approximately 2500 km from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown. Heineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement, with bars and restaurants reportedly preparing 'Like a Virgin' cocktails, named for her 1984 hit. A shop in the downtown neighbourhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganisation of the mega-event will be similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for the world-famous fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there has been some concern such problems may occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan incudes the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy carried out inspections of vessels that wish to position themselves at sea to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than four million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nMany spectators had come to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police cited by Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper at the time.", "source": {"uri": "celebrity.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "celebrity.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Huge screens dotted the venue. Offshore, boats bobbed in the water, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP.

But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer was expected to, over a span of two hours, portray all the Madonnas: the \"Material Girl,\" the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nSince the singer's arrival in Rio on Monday, hundreds of her fans have swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThat scene was repeated on Friday.\n\n\"Oi, Rio!\" she called out in Portuguese to

She's celebrating 40 years in music.\n\nMadonna teased fans with a preview before the concert. Some seven hours before the show, the singer posted on Instagram and wrote, \"Are you ready?\"\n\nIt was everything that a Madonna fan would want - there was exemplary music, dance, a lot of set and costume changes and beautiful light displays - that set the mood for the night.\n\nBefore Madonna arrived for the show, crowds of fans were seen dancing to Madonna's songs played from the speakers on the stage. This was hours before her concert began and she made an appearance.\n\nMadonna sang some of her greatest hits, including \"Nothing Really Matters\", \"Like a Prayer\" and \"Vogue\". She was also joined on stage at one point by Brazilian singer Anitta.\n\nAlso read: Ouch!

Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand.\n\nBy midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, \"Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state -- approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,555 miles) from Rio.\n\n\"Welcome Queen!\" read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown.\n\nHeineken wasn't the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared \"Like a Virgin\" cocktails. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear.\n\nOrganization of the mega-event was similar to New Year's Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna's show.\n\nRio state's security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil's navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show.\n\nA number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio's fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio's military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time.\n\nAna Beatriz Soares, a fan who was at Copacabana on Saturday, said Madonna has made her mark across the decades.\n\n\"Madonna had to run so that today's pop artists could walk. That's why she's important, because she serves as an inspiration for today's pop divas,\" Soares said.\n\n\"And that's 40 years ago. Not 40 days, 40 months. It's 40 years,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nationthailand.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation Thailand"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balcony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_(trade)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawker (trade)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.rio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".rio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heineken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cear\u00e1", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cear\u00e1"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cear\u00e1"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folha_de_S.Paulo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folha de S.Paulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fanny pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rod Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.nationthailand.com/uploads/images/md/2024/05/S7fSKeCz9o134aBYXuqu.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "dateEnd": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1628, "textEnd": 1635}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Tattooed on her shoulder is a phrase from the pop idol: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a trans woman, standing near the huge stage -- twice the size of any used previously on the tour -- built on the beach.\n\nAt nightfall, the \"world's largest dance floor\" will light up, with a succession of DJs performing.\n\nHours before the show, throngs of fans were already dancing to Madonna's songs blasting from speakers on the stage.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner in an attempt to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\nIf things stick to schedule, at 9:50 pm (00H50 GMT Sunday), the pop queen will stride onto an elevated walkway from the emblematic Copacabana Palace hotel, where she is staying, to the stage for one of the most important performances of her career.\n\n- A 'virgin' and a mother -\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert will provide a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer in June suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection.\n\nSince the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin,\" Madonna has released an album every two or three years.\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer will, over a span of two hours, portray ALL the Madonnas: the \"Material Girl,\" the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\nShe will affirm her motherhood as well: four of her six children will share the stage with her.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nTwo rehearsals on the eve of the concert, held in view of beachgoers, offered some clues as to what can be expected.\n\nMadonna sang \"Nothing Really Matters\" and \"Burning Up,\" as well as \"Live to Tell,\" in homage to AIDS victims.\n\nThe singer Pabllo Vittar, backed by a group of young drummers, also took part in the rehearsals, as did funk queen Anitta, who in 2020 recorded \"Faz Gostoso\" with Madonna.\n\nThe audience can also expect to hear hits such as \"Material Girl,\" \"Papa Don't Preach,\" \"La Isla Bonita\" and more than 20 other songs.\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nSince the singer's arrival in Rio on Monday, hundreds of her fans have swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThe response will come Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Others looked on from brightly lighted apartments and hotels lining the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna told the crowd.\n\nPointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: \"This place is magic.\"\n\nRio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance.\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million people attended the gig, more than 10 times Madonna's record attendance of 130,000 at Paris' Parc des Sceaux in 1987.\n\nMadonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. They danced on the sand during the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel.\n\nBy midday on Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying: \"Welcome, Madonna. You are the best. I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black-and-white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area teemed with street vendors, and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-coloured cone bra and a black cap.\n\n\"It's going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,\" said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area.\n\nEighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure all attendees could hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10.37pm local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals (\u00a346 million) into the local economy.\n\nHotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association.\n\nFans from Brazil, Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement.\n\nRio's international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights for the first week of May from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to see Madonna; who knows if she'll ever come back,\" said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil's Ceara state -- approximately 1,555 miles from Rio.", "source": {"uri": "yourlocalguardian.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Your Local Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Really_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nothing Really Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christ the Redeemer (statue)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balcony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_(trade)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawker (trade)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceaux,_Hauts-de-Seine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cear\u00e1", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cear\u00e1"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cear\u00e1"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/resources/images/18045729/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The concert marked the final show of Madonna's Celebration Tour, which started in October.\n\nThe 65-year-old pop singer's last concert included her classic hits like \"Like A Virgin\" and \"Hung Up.\" Fans packed the area and pushed against barriers, cheering on. House parties in apartments and hotels started to join the festivities while others watched from boats in the bay.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna said on stage. \"This place is magic.\"\n\nAccording to Madonna's official website, the Brazil show was the biggest of her four-decade career. It ten-fold exceeded the record attendance of 130,000 fans at her 1987 show at Paris' Parc dex Sceaux.\n\nKey moments from the show included Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar joining the singer on stage. During Madonna's performance of \"Live to Tell,\" she paid tribute to \"all the bright lights\" lost to AIDS, with black-and-white photos of those who lost their lives flashing behind her.\n\nMadonna was given warm welcomes from fans and companies like Heineken, who put out ads that said, \"Welcome Queen!\" Fans crowded around the Copacabana Palace Hotel, where Madonna stayed, to see the star.\n\nThe show started 50 minutes later, at 10:37 p.m. local time. Madonna has had issues with scheduling in the past. In January, two fans filed a lawsuit against the singer for starting her New York concert two hours late. Regardless, the free Brazil concert received a positive reception.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Madonna The Celebration Tour", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_hoang@uinterview.com", "name": "Ann Hoang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_Up", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung Up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Virgin_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Like a Virgin (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_hits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classic hits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabllo_Vittar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pabllo Vittar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anitta (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceaux,_Hauts-de-Seine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_to_Tell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live to Tell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heineken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/American-singer-Madonna-performs-on-stage-during-a-massive-free-show-to-close-The-Celebration-Tour-c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Huge screens dotted the venue. Offshore, boats bobbed in the water, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder is a phrase from the pop idol: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a trans woman, standing near the huge stage -- twice the size of any used previously on the tour.\n\nHours before the show, fans were already dancing to Madonna's songs blasting from the speakers on stage.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\n- A 'virgin' and a 'material girl' -\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer in June suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection.\n\nSince the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin,\" Madonna has released an album every two or three years.\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nMore from this section 87 Days: The Search for

News\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer was expected to, over a span of two hours, portray all the Madonnas: the \"Material Girl,\" the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nSince the singer's arrival in Rio on Monday, hundreds of her fans have swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThat scene was repeated on Friday.\n\n\"Oi, Rio!\" she called out in Portuguese to fans.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"\n\nll/app/llu/lbc/bbk/tjj/dhw",

It's the largest audience on record to watch a single-artist perform.\n\nThe legendary singer walked down an elevated bridge from the Copacabana Palace hotel at around 10:30 pm to kick things off on the massive stage. She wore all black and started the show with her hit, \"Nothing Really Matters.\" Millions of Brazilians packed the beach to see her, with her starting the concert calling Rio \"the most beautiful place in the world.\"\n\nMadonna performed dozens of songs in her set which featured several costume changes, lighting, and giant screens for the massive crowd to see her. Video from social media panning across the crowd showcases just how large the event really was. Madonna was joined on stage during her performance of \"Vogue\" by Brazilian singer Anitta. Later she moved on to \"Live to Tell,\" paying homage to AIDS victims including Freddie Mercury and Brazilian musician Cazuza.\n\nThe massive Madonna concert is estimated to provide a huge economic boon to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4M) toward the $12M show production costs.\n\nAccording to local authorities, they expect to see around 293 million reales ($57M) pumped back into the local economy thanks to this massive event. Brazil loves Madonna, with every corner of the Copacabana neighborhood littered with billboards, souvenirs, and t-shirts featuring images of the pop star.\n\nThe concert was a celebration of Madonna over the decades, made especially potent by the health scare the pop star had in June 2023. She was found unconscious and rushed to a hospital, where she received treatment for a serious bacterial infection. After more than 80 shows performed across Europe and North America -- Madonna put the capstone on her successful 'Celebration Tour' with an unforgettable night in Rio.\n\nShare on:\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link", "source": {"uri": "digitalmusicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Music News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_king@digitalmusicnews.com", "name": "Ashley King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Really_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nothing Really Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_to_Tell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live to Tell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cazuza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cazuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homage (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anitta (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/madonna-rio-concert-record-crowd-feat.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Huge screens dotted the venue. Offshore, boats bobbed in the water, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder is a phrase from the pop idol: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a trans woman, standing near the huge stage -- twice the size of any used previously on the tour -- built on the beach.\n\nAt nightfall, the \"world's largest dance floor\" will light up, with a succession of DJs performing.\n\nHours before the show, throngs of fans were already dancing to Madonna's songs blasting from speakers on the stage.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner in an attempt to minimise the usual mass robberies.\n\nA 'virgin' and a mother\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert will provide a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer in June suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection.\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video Like a Prayer, seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer will, over a span of two hours, portray ALL the Madonnas: the Material Girl, the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\nShe will affirm her motherhood as well: four of her six children will share the stage with her.\n\n'Oi, Rio!'\n\nTwo rehearsals on the eve of the concert, held in view of beachgoers, offered some clues as to what can be expected.\n\nMadonna sang Nothing Really Matters and Burning Up, as well as Live to Tell, in homage to AIDS victims.\n\nThe singer Pabllo Vittar, backed by a group of young drummers, also took part in the rehearsals, as did funk queen Anitta, who in 2020 recorded Faz Gostoso with Madonna.\n\nThe audience can also expect to hear hits such as Material Girl, Papa Don't Preach, La Isla Bonita and more than 20 other songs.\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales (RM18.7 million) toward the US$12 million (RM56.9 million) cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or US$57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighbourhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nSince the singer's arrival in Rio on Monday, hundreds of her fans have swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colourful balaclava.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices:

Huge screens dotted the venue. Offshore, boats bobbed in the water, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told Agence France-Presse.

But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer was expected to, over a span of two hours, portray all the Madonnas: the \"Material Girl,\" the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\n'Oi, Rio!'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nSince the singer's arrival in Rio on Monday, hundreds of her fans have swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThat scene was repeated on Friday.\n\n\"Oi, Rio!\" she

Madonna's official website hyped the show as the biggest in her four-decade career.\n\nIn recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star.\n\nBy midday on Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying: \"Welcome, Madonna. You are the best. I love you.\"\n\nFlags with \"Madonna\" printed against a background of Copacabana's iconic black-and-white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies.\n\nThe area teemed with street vendors, and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun. Eighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure all attendees could hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10.37pm local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule.\n\nCity Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would inject 293 million reals (\u20ac56m) into the local economy.\n\nHotel capacity was expected to reach 98pc in Copacabana, according to Rio's hotel association.

Huge screens dotted the venue. Offshore, boats bobbed in the water, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder is a phrase from the pop idol: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a trans woman, standing near the huge stage -- twice the size of any used previously on the tour.\n\nHours before the show, fans were already dancing to Madonna's songs blasting from the speakers on stage.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\n- A 'virgin' and a 'material girl' -\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer in June suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection.\n\nSince the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin,\" Madonna has released an album every two or three years.\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer was expected to, over a span of two hours, portray all the Madonnas: the \"Material Girl,\" the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and

The record was previously held by The Rolling Stones, when they performed at the venue in 2006 for a then record-setting 1.5 million fans.\n\nMadonna's Celebration Tour show included performances of some of her biggest hits including \"Just Like A Prayer,\" \"Nothing Really Matters,\" and \"Music.\" The performance marked Madonna's first show in Brazil since 2012.\n\nThe songstress had a special hometown guest during the \"Vogue\" portion of the show, as Anitta surprised the audience. For the segment, the \"Bellakeo\" singer joined Madonna as a judge for the ball, as she participated with the dancers and held up a \"10\" sign.\n\nFollowing the show, Madonna took to Instagram to share a video from the stage, where she celebrates Brazil's culture by waving the flag.\n\n\"Blame it on Rio \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Thank You Brazil!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83d\udd25 @pabllovittar @itau @tvglobo\n\n#musicmakesthepeoplecometogether,\" she wrote.\n\nAhead of the moment, Anitta -- who just released her latest album Funk Generation -- told ET she would be missing the Met Gala, because she was showing up for Madonna.\n\n\"Not this year,\" she told ET when asked if she's going to be at the Met Gala. \"I'm gonna be in Brazil with Madonna.\"\n\nMadonna kicked-off her Celebration Tour in October 2023 at London's O2 Arena. The North American leg of the tour began in December 2023, and ran with a series of special guests including Andy Cohen, Kelly Ripa, Cardi B, Pamela Anderson and Julia Garner.\n\nThe tour was delayed, as the singer recovered from a near-fatal viral infection. Madonna got emotional during night one of the show as she reflected on the health scare.\n\n\"It's been a crazy year for me. I didn't think I was going to make it, neither did my doctors.

Huge screens dotted the venue. Offshore, boats bobbed in the water, letting those onboard enjoy the show.\n\n\"I'm a mess, I haven't slept well, I've been listening to Madonna all week,\" 29-year-old sociologist Ina Odara told AFP. Tattooed on her shoulder is a phrase from the pop idol: \"All that you ever learned, try to forget.\"\n\n\"Madonna helped me leave the Catholic Church, think about many things and change my relationship with my family,\" said Odara, a trans woman, standing near the huge stage -- twice the size of any used previously on the tour.\n\nHours before the show, fans were already dancing to Madonna's songs blasting from the speakers on stage.\n\nPolice patrolled almost every corner to minimize the usual mass robberies.\n\n- A 'virgin' and a 'material girl' -\n\nAfter 80 performances across Europe and North America, the Rio concert provided a crowning touch to a tour that took on sudden urgency when the singer in June suffered a life-threatening bacterial infection.\n\nSince the 1984 release of \"Like a Virgin,\" Madonna has released an album every two or three years.\n\nHer shows, with their spectacular productions, set a high bar. But the ever-provocative Madonna has also provided unforgettable moments, like when she kissed Britney Spears at 2003's MTV Music Video Awards.\n\nHer irreverence led to a tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church, with Pope John Paul II urging fans to boycott her over her provocative 1989 video \"Like a Prayer,\" seen as blasphemous.\n\nIn Rio, the singer was expected to, over a span of two hours, portray all the Madonnas: the \"Material Girl,\" the bride, the rebellious Catholic, the virgin, the cowgirl, and others.\n\n- 'Oi, Rio!' -\n\nThe concert should provide an economic boost to Rio, which contributed 20 million reales ($4 million) toward the $12 million cost of the production.\n\nAuthorities say the concert should pump a far larger sum -- 293 million reales, or $57 million -- into the local economy.\n\nOn every corner in the Copacabana neighborhood are billboards, souvenirs or T-shirts bearing images of Madonna or of the conical corset designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and made famous by the diva.\n\nSince the singer's arrival in Rio on Monday, hundreds of her fans have swarmed outside the Copacabana Palace.\n\nThe excitement spiked Thursday night when Madonna unexpectedly appeared for a sound check, her face almost completely hidden behind a colorful balaclava.\n\nThe response on Saturday night from more than a million voices: \"Oi, Queen Madonna!\"",

The tour kicked off in October in London. According to AP, the concert in Copacabana was attended by 1.6 million people. It made history as the largest standalone concert for a single artist ever. Eighteen sound towers were set up on the beach to ensure that all the attendees were able to hear Madonna.\n\nThe 'La Isla Bonita' singer started off the show with her hit song 'Nothing Really Matters'. The crowd was buzzing with excitement and with 1.6 million people, there was hardly room to breathe. Their chants for the singer were echoing for miles.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna, 65, told the crowd.\n\nThe singer performed her many iconic hits including 'Like A Virgin', 'Hung Up, etc. For the introduction of her controversial song 'Like A Prayer', the singer was covered in a black cape and was holding a rosemary. She was also joined by Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar.\n\nMadonna has always been outspoken about the problems that the LGBTQ+ community faces and her concert was no different. She paid an emotional tribute to victims of AIDS as she sang 'Live To Tell'. Black and white pictures of people who lost their lives because of the illness were flashing on the screen behind her.\n\nThe whole city lit up in anticipation of Madonna. Flags with 'Madonna' printed on them were hanging from balconies. There was literally no space to walk on the beach. The whole city was brimming with excitement and the beach has probably never been this full.

Madonna performed this weekend.\n\nOn Saturday evening, more than a million people turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor as the pop star ended her global tour.\n\nIn front of the tightly packed crowd, Madonna, 65, said, \"We are in one of the most beautiful places on earth.\" While pointing out the ocean and the mountains, Madonna stated that \"this place is magical.\"\n\nPrior to the concert, the city was abuzz with anticipation as fans waited outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in hopes of catching a glimpse of the star. It is estimated that an additional 170 flights were landed at the city's airport as fans poured in from all over the world to attend the event.\n\nApproximately 1.6 million people attended the concert, some from brightly lit apartments and hotels overlooking the beach, while others from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.\n\nA dazzling show was put on by the singer, who played classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycled through several sets and costumes.\n\nShe performed her 1997 hit Nothing Really Matters flanked by giant screens to a roar of approval from the audience.\n\nDuring her performance of Live to Tell, the singer also paid an emotional tribute to \"all the bright lights\" lost to Aids. Black-and-white photographs of people who died of Aids accompanied the performance.\n\nThere is no doubt that Madonna is spectacular, said another.

On Saturday, that list also included late Brazilian artists, including the singers Cazuza, Renato Russo and the writer Caio Fernando de Abreu.\n\nLater in the show, Madonna welcomed to the stage Brazilian superstar Anitta, who served as a judge in the show's highly Instagrammable -- and often NSFW -- ballroom runway segment.\n\nPabllo Vittar, another Brazilian pop culture giant, also made a surprise appearance during Saturday's show. The global drag superstar helped Madonna kick the energy level into ecstasy levels as the duo sang Madonna's 2000 No. 1 hit \"Music,\" a new addition to the tour set list, alongside drum players from the city's samba schools.\n\nThe \"wonderful\" show proved that Madonna \"has always been ahead of her time,\" Mirelle de Fran\u00e7a, a 50-year-old journalist and longtime fan of the artist, told the Daily News.\n\n\"She was happy, radiant ... and made Rio happy,\" she added.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna told the audience at the beginning of the eagerly awaited performance that promised to turn Copacabana into \"the world's largest dance floor.\"\n\n\"This place is magic,\" she said, pointing out the ocean to her right, the mountains to her left and the Christ the Redeemer statue right behind her.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "muri_assuncao@nydailynews.com", "name": "Muri

While 65 years old, Madonna recently showcased her massive appeal when her final stop of her Celebration Tour welcomed over one million fans.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nBack in March, Madonna shared her excitement when she announced her final show during her Celebration Tour would take place at Copacabana Beach. And to make it even better, the concert was free. Making her way to Rio de Janeiro on May 4, Madonna kept her promise of a free concert. But nobody expected close to two million people to attend. But that is exactly what happened.

Others, like Live To Tell and Don't Tell Me, are beloved fan favourites.\n\nLast year, the superstar was found unconscious in her New York apartment in June and rushed to hospital, where she received treatment for a serious bacterial infection.\n\nBut she has since returned to full strength and her tour has been marked by her characteristically energetic performances.\n\nThe Rio concert was the final touch on a tour made up of 80 shows across Europe and North America.", "source": {"uri": "tvcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVC News Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Really_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nothing Really Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Like a Prayer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anitta (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greatest hits album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_of_Light_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray of Light (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_to_Tell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live to Tell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Tell_Me_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don't Tell Me (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holiday (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.tvcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/w980-p16x9-2024-05-05T051531Z_629960772_RC2YJ7ATWJVK_RTRMADP_3_MADONNA-BRAZIL.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

On May 4, 2024, an estimated 1.6 million people gathered to witness the grand finale of the singer's Celebration Tour, marking the largest audience ever for a stand-alone concert. This achievement not only underscores Madonna's enduring appeal but also her unique connection with fans worldwide.\n\nThe concert was a heartfelt \"thank you\" to her followers, celebrating more than four decades of groundbreaking music. Throughout the show, Madonna performed a slew of her biggest hits, including anthems like \"Like a Virgin,\" \"Hung Up,\" and \"Into the Groove,\" captivating the audience with her dynamic presence and the timeless quality of her music.\n\nA highlight of the night was Brazilian superstar Anitta joining Madonna on stage for a memorable rendition of \"Vogue,\" amplifying the excitement and underscoring the cultural synergy of the event. The inclusion of special guests such as Diplo, Pabllo Vittar, and Bob the Drag Queen, alongside the visual feast of Madonna's multiple outfit changes, magnified the concert's allure.\n\nMadonna's choice of Copacabana Beach as the venue for the tour's climax is symbolic, given its legacy of hosting monumental music events. It speaks to her flair for creating unforgettable moments that resonate on a global scale. This performance not only shattered attendance records but also set a new standard for live performances, turning the beach into what was dubbed \"the world's largest dancefloor.\"\n\nBeyond the glitz and glam of the night, the concert held a deeper significance. Madonna's touching acknowledgement of her children's support during her tour poignantly highlighted her resilience and personal journey back to the stage, emphasizing the concert's overarching message of gratitude, celebration, and triumph.\n\nAs the lights dimmed on Copacabana Beach, Madonna left an indelible mark on her Brazilian fans and on concert history.

There was a carnival atmosphere as crowds descended en masse to party to her iconic songs, including Holiday, Like a Virgin, Vogue, Express Yourself, Like a Prayer, Music, and Hung Up.\n\nThe audience in Rio was more than ten times her previous attendance record of 130,000 fans at Parc des Sceaux in Paris in 1987.\n\n\"Here we are, Rio, the most beautiful place in the world!\" greeted the diva - in her fourth concert in Brazil - who brought tears of emotion to the audience, which was expected to reach 1.5 million.\n\n\"Holiday\" served as a reminder of her beginnings, when she arrived in New York with $35 in her pocket, but \"with a dream.\"\n\nBlame it on Rio\n\nWith dozens of costume changes, spectacular lights, and many giant screens along the beach, Madonna demonstrated her infinite capacity for innovation.\n\nThe star wore a tight catsuit combined with reflective sunglasses and matching gloves. In a costume change, she wore a red and black lace robe and, in a tribute to the country passionate about football, she put on a Brazil soccer jersey that unleashed collective madness.\n\nDuring the show, special guests such as Diplo, Anitta, Pabllo Vittar and Bob the Drag Queen joined her on stage.\n\nThe concert had its emotional moments when the star paid a heartfelt tribute to \"all the bright lights\" lost to AIDS by singing \"Live to Tell.\" But it also had its usual controversial moments, including grabbing and passionately kissing a dancer.\n\nUnprecedented hotel occupancy\n\nThe megaconcert on the beach, whose production involved thousands of people and altered the life of the neighborhood, was an economic gamble by the Rio authorities, who injected $4 million of the $12 million that the production cost.\n\nThe City of Rio estimates that the show will bring $60 million to the local economy, with unprecedented hotel occupancy for the time of year and hundreds of restaurants and businesses doing their extra season.\n\nThe queen of pop did not disappoint those who waited up to twelve hours to see her and approached the audience several times along the three walkways that came off the giant 812-square-meter stage set up on the sands of Brazil's most famous beach.\n\nMadonna's Celebration Tour culminated in a spectacular finale in Rio de Janeiro, concluding a remarkable journey that is poised to surpass $225 million in earnings. The tour commenced its international odyssey in London in October 2023, thrilling audiences across Canada, the United States, and Mexico City.\n\nMadonna reigns supreme as the Guinness World Record holder for best-selling female recording artist, with an astounding 400 million records sold across albums, digital formats, and singles throughout her illustrious 40+-year career. Her reign extends beyond record sales, as she also holds the title of the highest-grossing female touring artist, a figure that is bound to rise even further following the conclusion of her

Madonna created history and proved why she is the Queen of Pop in the true sense when more than 1.6 million fans attended her free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro in the Latin American country of Brazil, reports 'Deadline'. As the concert was free, there is no ticket data, and without ticket data, it was difficult to gauge the size of the concert correctly.

Madonna's previous largest live concert crowd was attended by 130,000 fans in Paris in 1987.\n\nAccording to the 'New York Times', days of Madonna-mania in the city came to its extreme. Her songs spilled out of stores and car stereos, fans gathered outside her hotel and shouted her name. It was a milestone spectacle in Madonna's career. She chronicled her rise to stardom, with a cadre of dancers, four of her six children, and a wardrobe of elaborate costumes that recalled some of her most memorable looks.\n\nHow many fans did attend Madonaa's free concert held at Copacabana Beach in Brazil?\n\nAs the concert was free, there was no ticket data, and without ticket data, it is difficult to gauge the size of the concert correctly.

Madonna has taken her iconic hits around the world, and her final show in Rio showcased the overwhelming popularity she still enjoys after four decades as the Queen of Pop.\n\nThe city of Rio was gripped with \"Madonna-mania\" in the lead-up to the concert, with the singer's songs playing everywhere and fans gathering outside her hotel to catch a glimpse of the star. Updates about the concert dominated local media, while the event itself was broadcast on Globo TV.\n\nThe concert drew an enormous crowd to Copacabana Beach, a location known for hosting massive events in the past. Madonna's performance attracted an even larger audience than when the Rolling Stones played there to 1.2 million fans in 2006. It also approached the record set by Rod Stewart's 1994 concert, which drew 4 million people.\n\nThis large-scale free concert stands out amid a trend of soaring ticket prices and production costs for major live shows. In the United States, festivals like California's Coachella and Pennsylvania's Musikfest attract hundreds of thousands of attendees but at significant costs.\n\nThe Queen of Pop still reigns as far as her fans are concerned.\n\nThe concept for the grand event was initially conceived two years ago when Luiz Oscar Niemeyer, an executive at Rio de Janeiro-based live entertainment company Bonus Track, approached Madonna's managers after learning of her upcoming tour plans.

The security measures echo the ones taken on New Year's Eve, and for other similar performances by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones.\n\nThe show was the big finale to her Celebrations tour She performed all her hits, including Like A Virgin\n\nIn the days leading up to the event, the Brazilian Navy inspected the vessels that wished to drop anchor offshore for passengers to watch the show. More fans were hanging from apartment and hotel balconies, watching down on the show and the hoardes of attendees.\n\nThe massive gig is believed to have earned the local economy about 293 million reals (\u00a346m).\n\nUntil last night, Madonna's biggest ever gig had been in 1987 when she performed to 130,000 people at Paris' Parc des Sceaux.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat ,

The pair judged Madonna's dancers during the ballroom section of the performance, which sees the performers strutting their stuff down the runway before receiving scores from Madonna and the interchangeable celebrity guest judge.\n\nCity officials ordered firefighters to keep fans cool by spraying water on them before the concert and offering free drinking water as temperatures hit 27 degrees Celsius during the evening performance, according to The Guardian.

It was one of the biggest standalone concerts for any artist in history, with 1.6 million fans present. It was free to attend, and I could not resist.\n\nMadonna was only half the show; the rest of the spectacle was provided by Rio. Copacabana beach was the \"the world's biggest dancefloor\" and its people the most energetic performers, many dressed as the star herself. But the show started days before Madonna set foot on stage.\n\nFrom the moment I disembarked from the plane into Rio's international airport, I heard her songs and saw variations of her iconic conical corset. It set the tone for the Madonna-mania outside.\n\nBrazilians - and party-loving Rio residents - provided a contagiously energetic welcome. I'd been advised to get cabs everywhere for safety - and the minute I opened my taxi door outside the tropical, boutique Santa Teresa Hotel RJ-MGallery, I heard a nearby pub pumping out more vintage Madonna.\n\nI couldn't resist. Excited Brazilian fans were belting out early-noughties era songs as a widescreen projector played her videos. The pub, like every other shop and street stall I saw, was selling unofficial merchandise; sometimes creative, sometimes tacky: T-shirts, fans, cups, bandannas. I bought it all, before setting off to sip strong, sugary caipirinhas in a late-night street bar with my new friends. The singing continued.\n\nOn day one I headed to Ipanema Beach - the other main draw on the city's coastline - feeling safe enough to take public transport. It costs \u00a31 to travel from Saint Teresa's nearest subway stop, Gloria, almost directly to the beachfront; you simply tap in with your debit card.\n\nI was warned countless times to keep an eye on my phone. What was I wasn't prepared for was for my old flip-flops to be stolen on the beach, making for an uncomfortable barefoot trip back.\n\nIpanema Beach isn't somewhere to kick back and relax. It's somewhere to party, dance and drink more caipirinhas. They'll be served to your towel, along with souvenirs, sunglasses, food and anything else you could possibly want, but not really need.\n\nBeachgoers partied to Madonna songs. Billboards thanked her. Bars, restaurants and cafes had her posters on the walls and music on their speakers. It was an atmosphere unlike anything I'd experienced before.\n\nOver breakfast the next day, the hotel - \"a calm haven of serenity\" - was gloriously interrupted by a travelling samba street band: stilt walkers and drum bangers swigging Brazilian beer at 10.45am. A small monkey clambered for a better view in a tree overlooking the hillside view. It was the only music I heard all weekend that was not Madonna.\n\nOn Friday night, the night before the show, I met five superfans who - like me - had travelled from the UK to see the megastar, to them, as iconic as Christ the Redeemer himself. They suggested we meet at the grandiose beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel where Madonna was staying. Outside, hundreds chanted her name, wearing her T-shirt and waving adoring signs.\n\nAlessandro Storer, 39, from London, pointed at a bridge on the beach. \"She'll walk over that from rehearsals soon,\" he said as a pianist started a mid-tempo version of Like A Prayer. Storer had come for this \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity. \"This is Rio on steroids,\" he told me. \"There's a real sense from Brazilians that they're making history. I saw a bus of drag queens dressed as her yesterday.\"\n\nHe persuaded friend Stephen Bell, 45, also from London, to accompany him. They had booked their table for drinks at a bar close to the beach six months in advance. \"The hot, sunny weather has surprised me - it's not even summer,\" he told me. \"I'm mixed-race - I love the heat. I want to come back Asap.\"\n\nMarco Bertarini, 54, another Londoner, had seen every Madonna tour since 1987's Who's That Girl? Today, he'd got a tattoo behind his ear of a crown, symbolising his queen. The buzz had surprised and moved him. \"I didn't like Rio the first time I came, but I've realised maybe it was the people I was with,\" he said. \"The friendly welcome has made me fall in love with the city.\"\n\nClaudio Alberto, 49, also travelled over from London. \"I've never experienced anything like this,\" he said. \"We've been coming back here, outside the Copacabana Palace, to see all the people camped out daily. It's madness. It reminds me of the 90s.\"\n\nAcross the road, gay bar Pink Flamingos had transformed into a Madonna grotto, with giant posters of every album on every wall and her Superbowl performance playing on loop. Punters were dressed as her.\n\nAs concert time drew closer, I headed to the beach. Because the concert was taking place on the sand, it was an entirely different experience to the leg I saw at London's O2 last year, where the buzz largely stopped for other big-city interruptions. Rather than sitting in fixed arena seats, everyone was dancing. I was barefoot, which added to the liberated beach party feel; Brazilians swayed their hips to a samba version of Music.\n\nAn emotional Brazilian stranger, seeing me well up at Madonna's tribute to those we lost to Aids, hugged me tightly; our tears spoke for us.\n\nMusic may make people come together - 1.6 million of us - but Rio made us hug strangers, dance and cry together when we heard it, carried to our ears on the tropical breeze.\n\n\"Look around you,\" Madonna commanded mid-set. \"The sea. The warm beach, surrounded by love. Jesus behind us. This is f***ing heaven.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki",

This historic event not only marked the end of her tour, which started in October of the previous year, but also celebrated four decades of her influential presence in pop music.\n\nThe concert kicked off with Madonna performing her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters,\" followed by a string of her most beloved songs, including \"Like a Virgin,\" \"Hung Up,\" and \"Like a Prayer.\" The show featured electrifying guest appearances from Brazilian superstars Anitta and Pabllo Vittar, adding a local flavor to the global icon's performance.\n\nThe turnout at Copacabana Beach was monumental, matching the scale of major events the venue has witnessed in the past. To put it in perspective, the Rolling Stones drew 1.2 million people to the same location in 2006, and Rod Stewart holds the record for the largest free rock concert ever with 4 million attendees in 1994 -- although that number was likely bolstered by the New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nMadonna's concert at Copacabana Beach is now recorded as one of her largest live audiences since her 1987 performance in Paris, which drew 130,000 fans.

This grand event marked the conclusion of her global retrospective tour, which has mesmerized audiences worldwide since its commencement last October.\n\nIn what AP News described as an ethereal beginning to the concert, Madonna greeted her massive audience by saying, \"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world. This place is magic.\" And magical it was, as Madonna, the Queen of Pop, launched into her 1998 hit \"Nothing Really Matters,\" setting the tone for a night of memorable performances that spanned her illustrious career. Hits like \"Like a Virgin,\" \"Hung Up,\" and \"Like a Prayer\" echoed across the Brazilian shoreline, each song a testament to Madonna's enduring appeal and talent.\n\nBrazilian music sensations Anitta and Pabllo Vittar, who appeared at the concert, further elevated the international spectacle, adding a local flair. These artists' inclusion not only showcased Latin music's global influence but also highlighted Madonna's support for diverse talents in the music industry.\n\nRio's tourism agency said the event drew 1.6 million people to Copacabana Beach, a venue no stranger to colossal gatherings. This audience number surpassed previous records set by legendary acts like The Rolling Stones in 2006 and even Rod Stewart's 1994 concert, which holds the record for the largest free rock concert in history. However, it's noted that Stewart's concert coincided with the New Year's Eve celebration.\n\nMadonna's Copacabana Beach concert is now a milestone in her career, eclipsing her previous record of drawing 130,000 fans in Paris in 1987. This historic event celebrates her four decades of pop dominance and positions her as an unparalleled figure in the live music scene. The night on Copacabana Beach was more than a concert; it celebrated a storied career, a testament to Madonna's lasting legacy, and an unforgettable gift to her fans.\n\nLast update on 2024-05-05 /

such Like A Prayer, Vogue, Hung Up, Into The Groove and Like A Virgin.\n\nThe Brazil city was buzzing ahead of Saturday's free two-hour show, with hotels and Airbnb's packed and about 170 extra flights expected into the city.\n\nHelicopters and drones buzzed over the beach as the Queen of Pop took to the stage at 10:37pm, nearly 50 minutes late.\n\n\"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,\" Madonna told the crowd as she pointed out Rio's famous mountains and Christ the Redeemer statue.\n\nThe 65-year-old opened up with Nothing Really Matters from 1998's Ray of Light album.\n\nEighteen speaker towers were dotted along the beach to ensure everyone could hear the US star's vocals.\n\nBrazilian musicians and people from local samba schools were involved in the show - with many fans dressing up in Madonna-themed outfits.\n\n\"Since Madonna arrived here, I've been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,\" said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who wore a version of Madonna's iconic gold cone bra.\n\nMany fans had staked out a spot many hours - or even days - before the show, while others took in the spectacle from yachts or apartment balconies.\n\nMadonna's website said it was the biggest she had ever done - more than 10 times the 130,000 she played to in Paris in 1987.\n\nHowever, Rio is used to huge shows - The Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have played to similar-size crowds there.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nFlight nightmare causes Murs to cancel gig with Take That\n\nIs now a golden age for

million reals (\u00a346m).\n\nFor Madonna, it was the culmination of an 81-date retrospective tour that began in London in October and moved across Europe and North and South America.\n\nThe singer

Years later, she is still a massive draw live and she recently performed to a record-breaking audience.\n\nFans of Madonna know that even four decades into her career, she still refuses to play by the industry's rules. It was just a few months ago that she caused controversy by appearing on stage hours late for a scheduled performance, upsetting her audience and causing shockwaves through the industry with such behavior. Despite this, her star power remains intact and was out in full force Saturday, May 4th, as the 65-year-old singer took to the stage on the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.\n\nThe free event saw fans lining up to enter the event space days in advance and the city announced a 98% capacity for its hotels. An estimated 1.6 million fans eventually settled in for the concert, as giant screens and 18 sound towers were erected to ensure the audience could enjoy the event. Following last year's Taylor Swift concert where one fan died due to extreme heat, officials took extra measures for safety, watering down the area with firetrucks and providing free water to those in attendance.\n\nLooking out over the beautiful landscape of the region, Madonna stated, \"Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world. This place is magic.\" The evening certainly was a magical way to close out her Celebration world tour.", "source": {"uri": "weraveyou.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Rave You"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_vuoncino@weraveyou.com", "name": "Chris Vuoncino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://weraveyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Madonna.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540140", "eventUri": "eng-9540140", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 655, "textEnd": 662}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Throughout the evening, she flawlessly transitioned between personas, costumes, and musical styles, leaving the audience in awe with each transformation. Madonna showcased her unparalleled ability to command the stage from her early days as a rebellious schoolgirl in a cheeky miniskirt to her daring portrayal of an irreverent Christian draped in a black cape.\n\nBut perhaps the crowning jewel of Madonna's performance was her homage to Brazil itself. She donned a custom Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture ensemble inspired by the Brazilian flag. Complete with vibrant colors and intricate details, Madonna's outfit paid tribute to the rich cultural heritage of the host nation, earning her praise from fans and fashionistas alike.\n\nThe collaboration between Madonna and Jean Paul Gaultier was not just a sartorial triumph; it shows the enduring power of artistic partnerships. Gaultier's design, meticulously crafted to capture Madonna's essence, served as the perfect complement to her larger-than-life persona, elevating the concert to new heights of glamour and sophistication.\n\nThis monumental event, marked the grand finale of her \"Celebration.\" \"The traffic is chaos but the concert will be great, especially because it's Madonna, the queen of pop,\" said Borges, a resident of the area, to the publication Japan Today.\n\nThe only concern about the concert was the heat.

She recalled the ordeal during a reflective moment onstage at the first of her five sold-out Celebration World Tour shows at Los Angeles' Kia Forum in March.\n\n\"This show every night is not really so hard on me physically. It's hard on me emotionally because I'm really telling you the story of my life. My heart is on my sleeve,\" she said, according to People. \"I've fallen off a lot of horses and broken a lot of bones ... but nothing can stop me.\"\n\nMadonna went on to reference her health scare, revealing that the \"first word\" she said was \"No\" when she woke up from the coma.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure that was God saying to me, 'Do you want to come? Want to come up with me? No,'\" Madonna said.\n\nShe later recalled a conversation she had with her longtime manager, Guy Oseary, while in the hospital.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, when do you think you want to go back on tour?' I took the oxygen out of my nose. I looked at him, and I said, 'in two [expletive] months!\" she said. \"I just said it. Sometimes you just have to say [expletive] and put it out in the universe.

Masters 2024 raged on Monday with James Holzhauer and Victoria Groce winning big, and Amy Schneider looking defeated in last place.\n\nKen Jennings hosts the six-champ special worth $500,000 across the month of May.\n\nJeopardy! Masters Season 2 aired its second episode of two quarterfinal matches on ABC tonight.\n\nThe six elite-level contestants are Amy Schneider, James Holzhauer, Matt Amodio, Mattea Roach, Victoria, and Yogesh Raut.\n\nNewcomers Victoria and Yogesh led in the standings going in, hot off their \"dominating\" runaway wins in the premiere.\n\nSo episode two was all about the four returning Masters looking to settle the score.\n\nIn Game 1, Mattea faced Matt and \"self-proclaimed final boss\" reigning champ James (a rematch of last year's Masters finale).\n\nAfter their Jeopardy! round, Matt doubled to 10,000 on the first Daily Double, which he aced as Haydn, giving him 12000, James 6800, Mattea 1200.\n\nIn the interviews, James revealed he attended the SuperBowl but had \"pink eye\" which Ken quipped must have been tough for those with \"nose tickets.\"\n\nIn Double Jeopardy!, James - who was beaten by Yogesh in the premiere in a runaway - had a return to form, nabbing an early Daily Double and the lead.\n\nThen, came the dagger - Jeopardy! James caused gasps by going all in with 20,000 on the last Daily Double despite Matt being 1200 behind, which brought him to 40,000.\n\nJames finished Double Jeopardy with 45200, the highest score of Masters history.\n\nEveryone was correct with \"Clemenseau,\" giving James an extra 908 and a record-breaking 46108 for 3 matchpoints, Matt 1, Mattea 0.\n\nFans flooded social media dazzled by James' massive win though some admitted they were expecting a joke Final Jeopardy answer with a runaway.\n\nIn fact, aside from his name being written in Japanese on his podium, there were no jokes on the board from James who seemed hellbent on just winning.\n\n\"I thought James might come up with an unhinged message,\" joked a third surprised by James' seriousness.\n\nA fourth agreed, \"I'm a little sad we haven't had a pro wrestling taunt intro or a joke Final Jeopardy response from James this year. But it is still fun.\"\n\nIn Game 2, Amy faced last week's winners Victoria and Yogesh.\n\nIn the Jeopardy! round, Victory doubled to 8800 on the first Daily Double, winding up with 12200, Yogesh hammered away at the buzzer to 5000, and Amy had a mere 600.\n\n\"They should put Yogesh in a video daily double and the answer be \"what is violating a buzzer button\"\" one Redditor joked.\n\n\"All hail queen Victoria,\" another X user wrote, as a third pointed out \"Amy is in way back third place.\"\n\n\"Yogesh, your clicker is working. You don't need to put your full body weight into it each time. The other contestants are just faster than you #Jeopardy,\" wrote a third.\n\n\"Watching Yogesh mash the buzzer is hilarious,\" wrote a fourth.\n\nIn the interviews, Victoria revealed her daughter Nora, in college, is barred from having an emotional support \"lobster\" in her dorm.\n\nIn Double Jeopardy, Amy gained 2000 \"Jeoparbucks\" on the second Daily Double in \"the nick of time.\"\n\nVictoria found the last Daily Double and aced it as \"hoover\" bringing her to 33600 and a runaway.\n\nBy the end of Double Jeopardy she had 41000, Yogesh 11800 and Amy 10200- which meant she once again finished last place.\n\n\"We knew Victoria would be good but WOW,\" an additional fan wrote.\n\nAnother lamented, \"Amy's confidence is so shot. 40 games and second-place finishes in ToC are sooooo commendable chin up babes!\"\n\nAn additional fan wrote, \"Imagine if the Producer's Pick ends up in 6th place lol,\" referring to Amy.\n\nOne more wrote, \"She most likely will. Amy is super smart and likable and one of my favorite players but she just isn't on the same level as the others.\"\n\nThe standings now are as follows: Victoria leads with 6 match points, James has 4, Yogesh has 4, Matt has 1, Mattea has 1 and Amy has 0.\n\nMasters began on May 1 and is scheduled to conclude with a grand finale on May 22.\n\nThe annual spinoff is meant to determine the best player in any given year.\n\nThe Masters grand prize is $500,000, a glitzy Alex Trebek trophy to honor the late iconic host and the title of Masters Champion.\n\nFear not, show traditionalists, as Masters will not interfere with regular gameplay, and both will air those nights.\n\nEach Masters episode consists of two half-hour games, and the winner of each is awarded three points, while the runner-up receives one.\n\nThe four players with the most points will then advance to the semifinals, and the top three competitors will face off in finals.\n\nJames is the one to beat, and that's no secret as he's considered the best aside from host Ken- and won Masters 2023.\n\nBut Yogesh and Victoria - who went on mere three-day and one-day winning streaks, respectively - have clearly come to play.\n\nIn the premiere, Victoria notched a 30,000 runaway that Ken called a \"statement,\" and Yogesh defeated James in a runaway too.\n\nVictoria and James are (or were?) co-stars on the ABC sister show The Chase, one major draw this year.\n\nJames only lost once during Masters last year, so it was especially surprising to see him lose on arrival.\n\nJames trailed nearly all game and going into Double Jeopardy!, Ken remarked it was a rarity to see James \"in third place.\"\n\nAnother major draw is the rivalry between Yogesh and James.\n\nThe special's \"villains\" grew up in the same area of Michigan and did trivia together, as Yogesh mentioned in the premiere to a stoic James.\n\nIndeed, Yogesh also once bragged about being \"better\" than James at high school trivia on stage.\n\nOn Reddit fans are already predicting a \"Yogesh, James, Victoria top three\"\n\nJames is a 32-time winner and pro sports better living in Las Vegas - known for his \"all in\" Daily Doubles and huge wins - he won Masters Season 1 in a breeze.\n\nMattea, a 23-time winner, returns as the runner-up and they nearly defeated James in last year's finale.\n\nMatt, a 38-time winner, placed third last year and was the only player to notch a win against James the entire special, but also was \"most inconsistent\".\n\n\"I feel like a stronger competitor,\" Amodio said on his prep at a recent event attended by The U.S. Sun.\n\nAmy, a 40-time champion, placed second-to-last last year and also lost the recent JIT to Victoria - she was chosen as the Producer's Pick due to her popularity.\n\nAmy being named the Producer's Pick wasn't without its drama as she placed bottom of Masters Season 1.\n\nShe also decisively lost the recent Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament to Groce, only for both to move forward to Masters either way.\n\nAmy even acknowledged the backlash on stage in the premiere, \"I do think I belong here, and I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited to be here,\" Schneider said to Jennings. \"\n\nBut it also feels like it gives me a little bit something more to prove, that I didn't earn my way back in the same way that the other contestants did.\"\n\nYogesh is a controversial three-day champ who punched his ticket by winning the intense 2024 Tournament of Champions.\n\nVictoria, a mere one-day champ from 2005, qualified by winning the recent Jeopardy's Invitational Tournament against Amy and Andrew He, no small feat.\n\nJeopardy! Masters continues on Wednesday May 8 with Games 3 and 4 on ABC at 8 p.m. ET. and on Hulu.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darian_lusk@the-sun.com", "name": "Darian Lusk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Schneider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amy Schneider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Holzhauer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Holzhauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!

Vancouver's Yogesh Raut, a cognitive and behavioral scientist, faced off against Matt Amodio, a quantitative researcher from New York, and Amy Schneider, a writer from Oakland, California.\n\n(No cable or satellite? You can stream \"Jeopardy Masters\" via Fubo, which offers a free trial.)\n\nRaut, who won in his first appearance in the \"Jeopardy Masters\" tournament, but who finished second to Victoria Groce in the episode that aired Monday, May 6, enjoyed a healthy lead going into the \"Final Jeopardy\" round on Wednesday's episode.\n\nThe \"Final Jeopardy\" category was \"Theater.\" The clue: \"This show debuted December 30, 1879 at a theater on the Devon coast, with the cast in costumes from a related show.\"\n\nAs with so many of the \"Final Jeopardy\" clues in this \"Jeopardy Masters\" tournament, it was tough. But Amodio had the correct answer, with \"What is 'The Pirates of Penzance?'\" Amodio had 7,200 and bet it all, raising his total to 14,400.\n\nSchneider also had the right answer. She wagered 2,201, which raised her 12,200 total to 14,401, beating Amodio by one dollar.\n\nRaut, who entered \"Final Jeopardy\" with 36,400, didn't know the answer. But he wagered zero, which left him with 36,400 and a second win.\n\nFollowing the Game 5 victory for Raut, it was time for Game 6, which saw the much-anticipated competition between Groce, a writer and television personality from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and James Holzhauer, the self-described \"Final Boss\" of \"Jeopardy!,\" from Las Vegas. The third player was Mattea Roach, a writer and podcast host from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhen it was time for \"Final Jeopardy,\" Groce was in the lead, with 29,600; Holzhauer was in second, with 17,600; and Roach was in third, with 7,000.\n\nThe \"Final Jeopardy\" category was \"Famous Last Words.\" The clue: \"In 1530 he made his last confession and wished that 'I had served God as diligently as I have done the king.'\"\n\nRoach guessed \"Who is Thomas More?\" which wasn't correct. Roach wagered everything, leaving them with zero.\n\nHolzhauer also guessed that the answer was Thomas More, and he wagered 6,400, which dropped his total to 11,200.\n\nGroce also guessed wrong, with More. The correct answer, as host Ken Jennings said, was More's predecessor, Cardinal Wolsey. Groce wagered 5,601, which dropped her total to 23,999, so Groce, as Jennings said, escaped with the win.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the \"Jeopardy Masters\" leaderboard had Groce in the lead, Raut in second, Holzhauer in third, Amodio in fourth, Schneider in fifth, and Roach in sixth place.\n\nThe three players who accumulate the most match points over the three-week \"Jeopardy Masters\" tournament will advance to the finals. The ultimate winner of \"Jeopardy Masters\" will take home a grand prize of $500,000.\n\n\"Jeopardy Masters\" continues with Games 7 and 8 at 8 p.m., Friday, May 10, on ABC.\n\n-- Kristi Turnquist covers features and entertainment.

Tell us about your name.\"\n\nShe proudly replied, \"I am a member of the Comanche tribe, it is a Comanche name.\n\n\"It was my mother's, grandmother's, and great-great grandmother's name - and it means a woman on a horse looking for something.\"\n\nShe continued, \"And in the story, of course, what she's looking for is her sweetheart.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Ken replied in awe and asked if the name \"applies differently\" to Jeopardy! - \"Are you looking for the Tournament of Champions, for example?\"\n\n\"I've got it in my sights,\" she concluded, but it wasn't meant to be.\n\nAfter the Jeopardy! round, Weckiai had a dazzling $10,000 and an early Daily Double, Matthew $2,800, and Carrie $3,000.\n\nIn Double Jeopardy!, Weckiai controlled the game, but despite 28 correct responses overall, she couldn't notch a runaway.\n\nShe missed a $2000 Daily Double, while Matt got the remaining Daily Double for $4000 with only two clues left.\n\nGoing into Final Jeopardy, Weckiai had $19,600, Matthew had $13,200, and Carrie had $10,600, so it was anyone's game.\n\nThe clue under \"HISTORIC GROUPS\" read, \"Like their uniform, the flag of this group created in 1506 has stripes of red, blue & yellow, the colors of the Medici family.\"\n\nOnly Matthew was correct with \"Swiss Guard\", doubling up to $26,400 and winning from second place.\n\nFans took to social media feeling for Weckiai since, despite her \"strongest performance,\" she lost - and was on the Tournament of Champions cusp.\n\n\"This was kind of a reverse situation for Weckiai from Friday's game: she did REALLY well in the main part of the game but missed FJ. I'm sad to see her go and hope she does great in Champions Wildcard,\" one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother agreed, \"What a difference a day can make between Fridays game and Today. Three really strong performances. Even though Weckiai lost she put up her strongest performance.\n\n\"I wouldn't be too shocked if she manages to make it in [to the ToC],\" they added.\n\n\"Weckiai has to be one of the coolest names I've heard!\" a third simply wrote.\n\nA fourth wrote, \" Love native representation on my favorite game show!\"\n\nMatthew will go up against two new challengers tomorrow night to see if he can turn his upset win into a streak.\n\nSo far, the official qualifiers for the next ToC are five-day champs Alison Betts, Amy Hummel, and Celebrity Jeopardy's Lisa Ann Walter.\n\nMeanwhile, Season 2 of Jeopardy! Masters continues tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. ET in primetime, so fans are getting 1.5 hours of Jeopardy!.\n\nMasters pits the six top-ranked contestants from recent seasons against one another to see who is really the best.\n\nThe contenders are reigning champ James Holzhauer, last year's finalists Matt Amodio and Mattea Roach, Producer's Pick Amy Schneider, and newcomers Yogesh Raut and Victoria Groce.\n\nEach hour-long episode features two games, and the grand prize is $500,000, along with the title of Jeopardy! Masters champion.\n\nThe two newcomers dominated the premiere with runaway wins and are at the top of the leaderboard going into Game 3 and Game 4.\n\nFans are waiting with bated breath to see if Yogesh and Victoria will keep the wins coming or if James and the return players can win.\n\nFear not, show traditionalists, as Masters will not interfere with regular gameplay, and both will air those nights.\n\nMasters is an annual spinoff meant to determine the best player in any given year.\n\nMasters began on May 1 and is scheduled to conclude with a grand finale on May 22.\n\nEach Masters episode consists of two half-hour games, and the winner of each is awarded three points, while the runner-up receives one.\n\nAfter the fifth and sixth placers are eliminated, two semifinal episodes will begin on Friday, May 17.\n\nAfter the fourth placer is eliminated, the finale will air on May 22.\n\nOne episode of two finals matches will determine the winner based on the highest combined total.\n\nJames is the one to beat, and everyone is looking to see if he can win Masters back-to-back.\n\nBut Yogesh and Victoria - pro quizzers who only went on three-day and one-day winning streaks, respectively - are the frontrunners so far.\n\nVictoria and James are (or were?) co-stars on the ABC sister show The Chase, one major draw this year.\n\nAnother major draw is the playful rivalry between the special's two \"heels,\" Yogesh and James.\n\nThey grew up in the same area of Michigan as Yogesh mentioned in the premiere to a stoic James.\n\nIndeed, Yogesh also once bragged about being \"better\" than James at high school trivia on stage.\n\nOn Reddit fans are already predicting a \"Yogesh, James, Victoria top three.\"\n\nJeopardy! airs at 7 p.m. ET depending on local affiliates - while Masters will air at 8 p.m. ET on ABC nationwide.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darian_lusk@the-sun.com", "name": "Darian Lusk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(NJSIAA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (NJSIAA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ken Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albuquerque, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albuquerque, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!

Masters", "body": "TRIVIA expert Victoria Groce is blazing a trail in Jeopardy! Masters 2024, all while powering through a recent injury.\n\nThe Queen of The Chase revealed on social media that she sprained her knee before dazzling fans in the tournament.\n\nJeopardy! Masters Season 2 is upon us, now airing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday across May.\n\nKen Jennings hosts the six-champion special, which determines the best Jeopardy! contestant in any given year.\n\nThe prize is $500,000, an Alex Trebek Trophy, and the ultimate bragging rights.\n\nThe contestants are reigning champ James Holzhauer, Matt Amodio, Mattea Roach, Amy Schneider, and newcomers Victoria and Yogesh Raut.\n\nVictoria, a mere one-day champ from 2005, qualified by winning the recent Invitational tournament.\n\nShe has proven to be a buzzsaw, as she is the only Master with two out of two wins after the first two episodes, putting her in first place.\n\nHowever, the trivia expert is actually doing it all while recovering from a minor fall.\n\nIn Masters episode two, Victoria correctly responded to a clue as \"Medial Collateral Ligament,\" or the outside part of the knee.\n\nShe added with a laugh, \"I just sprained mine!\"\n\nVictoria wrote on X after the game that she wasn't joking, \"FWIW, I was absolutely serious about the MCL thing.\n\n\"I fell off a climbing wall last fall and landed on one foot. Not one of the better things you can do to your knee! #JeopardyMasters.\"\n\nFans flooded her post wishing her a speedy recovery and all the more impressed by her Masters gameplay.\n\n\"Sorry to hear that, Victoria. Must be painful,\" one fan wrote.\n\n\"You are a Jeopardy monster lmao I cannot WAIT to see you and James battle it out on Wednesday,\" wrote a second.\n\n\"You're killing it, Victoria. At this point IBM Watson is scared of you,\" joked a third.\n\n\"You are doing a fabulous job! Rooting for you to win it all,\" wrote a fourth.\n\n\"Hope your knee is pain free now. Keep on winning!\" wrote a fifth.\n\nVictoria is a quiz expert hailing from Georgia but now living in Pittsburgh with her husband.\n\nShe has a college-aged daughter, Nora, 18, whom she incorporates into her Final Jeopardy answers.\n\nBefore serving as The Queen on The Chase, she knocked down David Madden's 19-day streak on Jeopardy! at a young age.\n\nVictoria lost one game later and hasn't returned since, becoming a trivia titan away from Jeopardy!, giving her a bit of an outlier origin story.\n\nThis left fans speculating about whether the \"Giant Killer\" truly got to fulfill her Jeopardy! potential and she finally did so in the JIT and now Masters.\n\n\"I never thought I would be here again. I felt I was basically a kid in a lot of ways,\" Victoria recently shared.\n\n\"I know I had a kid of my own but I was at a very unsettled time in my early 20s. So to be back here as an adult is kind of blowing my mind.\"\n\nIn her 20s, Victoria also suffered from \"debilitating\" migraines, which left her struggling to hold down her job and ultimately afforded her the time to hone her trivia excellence.\n\n\"I had days where I had to take sick days off work because I couldn't manage the 15-minute walk from the parking to my office.\"\n\n\"I had time and I had space and I had not a lot of ability to do much of anything else. So, I gradually started just doing more and more [trivia].\"\n\nWhen she finally returned to quizzing, she made a name for herself.\n\nIn 2021, Groce was named World Quizzer of the Year.

Masters' Night Three: Has Victoria Groce Become the 'Final Boss'?", "body": "At the start of Jeopardy! Masters Season 2, Season 1 champ James Holzhauer declared that he was the \"final boss\" of the entire competition, but so far, it's been the Victoria Groce show, through and through.\n\nIn the third night of competition -- for Games 5 and 6 on Wednesday, May 8 -- Groce once again took the lead and held it. And although it wasn't a runaway this time (for the first time in Masters' second season so far), she still had a commanding performance. So is Victoria Groce the new \"final boss\" of this season? Well, there's still a lot of gameplay to go, but she's off to a good start.\n\nComing into the night, the tallies of match powers were: Victoria Groce in 1st place with 6, James Holzhauer in 2nd place with 4, Yogesh Raut in third place with 4 (because of the tiebreaker being the number of correct responses), Matt Amodio in 4th with 1, Mattea Roach in 5th with 1 point, and Amy Schneider trailing in 6th with 0.\n\nHere's a look at everything that happened on night three of Jeopardy! Masters Season 2.\n\nGame Five\n\nThe first match-up saw Amy Schneider, Matt Amodio, and Yogesh Raut going head-to-head. Raut came in with one win and a second-place finish under his belt, while Amodio had just one second-place finish, and Schneider had none.\n\nIt didn't take long for Raut to forge his way to frontrunner status, earning $5,400 in the first round, with Schneider pulling up the rear with $4,600 and Amodio earning $2,200. (Note: Amodio did get the Daily Double; in the category \"European Geography,\" the clue was, \"A palace in this city in Provence is a reminder of its role in the Catholic church in the 14th Century. Amodio wagered $1,000 -- the most he could due to being in the red -- and guessed \"Avignon.\")\n\nThough all the contestants kept it close enough in the first round, Double Jeopardy was an absolute trouncing. While Amodio did get another Daily Double (and correctly guessed that a pangolin is the described scaly cousin of an anteater), Raut got the second and bet the whole house, which was already $15,400 at that point. Raut doubled his score by correctly guessing that O'Brien from 1984 was the character who taunted Winston about being betrayed immediately.\n\nRelated'Jeopardy!': Amy Schneider Speaks Out Amid 'Masters' Appearance Backlash\n\nThus, going into Final Jeopardy, it was yet another runaway with a race for that singular second-place match point: Raut came in with $36,400, while Schneider had $12,200, and Amodio had $7,200.\n\nThe Final Jeopardy category was \"The Theater,\" and the clue was, \"This show debuted December 30, 1879, in a theater on the Devon Coast, with the cast in costumes from a related show.\"\n\nPerhaps ironically, Raut was the one person who didn't get it right -- the answer: Pirates of Penzance -- but he wisely wagered nothing and kept his lead at $36,400, with Schneider taking second (and earning her first match point) with $14,401, just $1 more than Amodio's final score of $14,400.\n\nGame Six\n\nThe second game featured Mattea Roach, James Holzhauer, and Victoria Groce -- the first meeting of the two The Chase stars in the competition.\n\nHolzhauer had a great start and even found the Daily Double in the first round, but he got the answer wrong after being \"all the cheddar\" -- costing him a gutting $5,800. (The clue, in the category of \"Starts and Ends with R,\" was, \"This device allows air to get from a scuba diver's oxygen tanks & into the diver's lungs.\" While Holzhauer did have a guess that matched the category parameters -- \"What is 'respirator'?\" -- the answer was, \"Regular.\")\n\nThus, Groce's $6,000 from the round was enough to head into Double Jeopardy in front, with both Holzhauer and Roach trailing at $1,400.\n\nIn Double Jeopardy, Groce pulled a power move upon finding a Daily Double, echoing Holzhauer by pressing her hands forward and saying, \"I believe the move is 'all-in,'\" putting her entire $14,000 prize pot on the line. Holzhauer cheekily replied with, \"Poor technique. Good strategy, though.\" Indeed it was that; in the category \"They Did Bad,\" Groce correctly guessed that Machine Gun Kelly was the person \"nicknamed for a lethal weapon regulated by Congress in 1934\" who didn't kill anyone but did kidnap.\n\nStill, impressive though her performance was, host Ken Jennings happily noted, \"Look at this! For the first time in this competition, first place is not a foregone conclusion as we head into Final Jeopardy.\"\n\nFor Game 6's Final Jeopardy round, the category was \"Famous Last Words,\" and the clue was, \"In 1530, he made his last confession and wished that 'I had served God as diligently as I have done the king.'\"\n\nNot a single one of the masters correctly guessed it the answers -- they all guessed Thomas More, although the answer was Cardinal Wosley -- so it came down to the betting strategy. Groce put just $5,601 on the line, so she finished with $23,999; Holzhauer lost $6,400, taking his score down to $11,200; and Roach wagered all $7,000 of their money and ended with $0.\n\nAnd with that, the new leaderboard scores are as follows:\n\n1st = Victoria Groce - 3 tonight, 9 total\n\n2nd = Yogesh Raut - 3 tonight, 7 total\n\n3rd = James Holzhauer - 1 tonight, 5 total\n\n4th = Matt Amodio - 0 tonight, 1 total*\n\n5th = Amy Schneider - 1 tonight, 1 total\n\n6th = Mattea Roach - 0 tonight, 1 total\n\n*Tiebreaker is the number of correct responses.\n\nJeopardy!

Congratulations again to Matthew Smith, our new Champion! I was so happy to go out in a game where I was genuinely happy with my performance.\n\n\"I would love another opportunity to prove myself on the Alex Trebek stage.\n\n\"I know I might have given some viewers the impression of being cold or awkward, but I was really just in awe by what I was able to do by even appearing on the show.\"\n\nHer Reddit post stirred up mixed reactions, some giving her props while others still weren't impressed by her demeanor.\n\n\"I did not think you appeared cold or awkward. You seemed confident and sure of yourself to me,\" one user replied.\n\n\"Tbh, I would have no clue how to act on stage. I did not get the cold/awkward vibe from you at all. You crushed it! Congrats on a great run,\" wrote another.\n\nA third replied, \"I'm glad you came here to say this cause honestly, when you didn't win last night, you seemed very cold, and it came off as a sore loser.\n\n\"You didn't even congratulate (at least not on camera/ as the credits rolled) that guy or look in their direction at all.\n\n\"While you probably owe him an explanation or apology, I respect that you acknowledged it here where you know you have a fan base.\"\n\nRight after the broadcast, fans flocked to social media, shocked by what they saw as a lack of sportsmanship.\n\n\"Boy, did Weckiai pout when she lost,\" one Facebook user wrote.\n\nI have never seen a sore loser on Jeopardy like Weckiai. That was so gross,\" another went as far as to say.\n\n\"I think she was just disappointed in herself,\" defended a third.\n\nA fourth agreed, \"She wanted to go farther, understandably enough! I prefer a genuine emotion - she lost, she was upset.\"\n\nLosing in game four is especially tough for Jeopardy! contestants in regular play.\n\nA fourth win all but guarantees a spot in the next Tournament of Champions.\n\nWeckiai was aware of as much, saying on stage that the esteemed tournament was \"in her sights,\" only to fall short.\n\nJames - who lost episode 1 to Yogesh- finished Double Jeopardy with 45200, the highest score of Masters history.\n\nFans flooded social media dazzled by James' massive win, though some admitted they were expecting a joke Final Jeopardy answer with a runaway.\n\nIn fact, aside from his name being written in Japanese on his podium, there were no jokes on the board from James who seemed hellbent on just winning.\n\n\"I thought James might come up with an unhinged message,\" joked a third surprised by James' seriousness.\n\nA fourth agreed, \"I'm a little sad we haven't had a pro wrestling taunt intro or a joke Final Jeopardy response from James this year. But it is still fun.\"\n\nIn Game 2, Amy faced last week's winners Victoria and Yogesh.\n\nVictoria found the last Daily Double and aced it as \"Hoover\" bringing her to 33600 and a runaway.\n\nBy the end of Double Jeopardy Victoria had a stunning 41000 runaway, Yogesh 11800 and Amy 10200- which meant Amy once again finished last place.\n\n\"We knew Victoria would be good but WOW,\" one fan wrote.\n\nAnother lamented, \"Amy's confidence is so shot. 40 games and second-place finishes in JIT are sooooo commendable chin up babes!\"\n\nAn additional fan wrote, \"Imagine if the Producer's Pick ends up in 6th place lol,\" referring to Amy.\n\nOne more wrote, \"She most likely will.

Masters 2024 continued on Wednesday, with Yogesh Raut winning big and Victoria Groce remaining undefeated by beating James Holzhauer.\n\nKen Jennings scored criticism for introducing the highly anticipated Victoria/James match by putting Mattea Roach on the back burner.\n\nJeopardy! Masters Season 2 aired its third act of two quarterfinal matches on ABC tonight.\n\nThe six elite-level contestants are reigning champ James Holzhauer, Amy Schneider, Matt Amodio, Mattea Roach, and newcomers Victoria and Yogesh Raut.\n\nAfter a record-breaking win on night two, James was tied with Yogesh in second place, while Victoria hadn't lost yet, leading overall.\n\nEpisode Three had fans buzzing to see if Victoria could outplay James in their long-awaited matchup.\n\nBut Ken surprisingly and bluntly noted that The Chase co-stars were the main draw when he introduced Game 2.\n\nHe told viewers between the two games, \"Coming up, it's the very first match between two heavy hitters, James Holzhauer and Victoria Groce, with Mattea Roach in the mix as well.\"\n\nFans didn't love the comment as they felt it was rude to Mattea.\n\n\"A bit of disrespect not calling Mattea a 'heavy hitter;' they didn't win 23 games in their initial Jeopardy! run for nothing,\" one X user wrote.\n\n\"Stay strong, Mattea,\" wrote another.\n\nHere's how the gameplay went aside from Ken's surprising Mattea snub.\n\nIn Game 1, Matt faced Yogesh and Amy - with only Yogesh having won a game so far.\n\nA match point here for Amy was especially crucial as she has zero points overall and was in last place.\n\nAfter their Jeopardy! round, things were neck and neck with Yogesh at 5400, Matt at 2200, and Amy at 4600.\n\nIn the interviews, Amy sang the Dayton, Ohio theme song, Matt talked about being a Jane Austen stan, and Yogesh bragged about the laundry list of contestants he's had on his podcast.\n\nIn Double Jeopardy!, Matt found a Daily Double right away, leveling the scores, then Yogesh caused gasps, betting his entire 15000 on the remaining one and acing it.\n\nSuddenly, Yogesh had 30,000, so it was game over, and he notched his second runaway win.\n\nGoing into Final Jeopardy, Yogesh had 36,400, Amy 12,200 and Matt 7,200.\n\nMatt and Amy aced the clue as \"Pirates of Penzance,\" giving Yogesh 3 points, Amy on the board with 1 point, and Matt 0.\n\n\"Just when I thought Amy had a chance! Yogesh with the gutsy DD,\" one Redditor wrote.\n\n\"Wow Yogesh on that true DD late in the game! Holy mackerel. Nerves of steel,\" wrote another.\n\n\"Yogesh can't stop bragging about himself, but backed it up by winning a #JeopardyMasters game,\" wrote a third.\n\nIn Game 2, the big guns came out as Victoria finally faced James, her co-star on The Chase, with Mattea against the buzzsaws.\n\nIn their Jeopardy! round, James found a late Daily Double with 5800 but missed it, sinking to 0. By the end of the round, Victoria had a dazzling 6000, James 1400, and Mattea 1400.\n\nDuring their interviews, Ken asked if Victoria and James were \"rivals\" on The Chase, the two looked at each other and James joked, \"we intrinsically compete with each other.\"\n\nIn Double Jeopardy!, James nabbed the second Daily Double and Victoria found the last one going \"all in,\" mimicking her coworker.\n\n\"Poor technique,\" James joked, then she got it correct, giving her 28000.\n\nBut in a Masters 2024 first, it wasn't a runaway, and Victoria had 29800, James 17600 and Mattea 7000.\n\nNo one got Final Jeopardy and Victoria survived the scare to win, going three for three and pulling ahead of the pack.\n\nShe got another three match points, James 1, and Mattea got 0.\n\nMasters began on May 1 and is scheduled to conclude with a grand finale on May 22.\n\nThe annual spinoff is meant to determine the best player in any given year.\n\nThe Masters grand prize is $500,000, a glitzy Alex Trebek trophy to honor the late iconic host and the title of Masters Champion.\n\nFear not, show traditionalists, as Masters will not interfere with regular gameplay, and both will air those nights.\n\nEach Masters episode consists of two half-hour games, and the winner of each is awarded three points, while the runner-up receives one.\n\nThe four players with the most points will then advance to the semifinals, and the top three competitors will face off in finals.\n\nThe bottom two will be eliminated before the two semifinal episodes beginning on Friday, May 17.\n\nAfter the fourth placer is eliminated, the finale will air on May 22.\n\nThe round-robin tournament sees every combination of the famous contestants face off before any eliminations happen, and it all is determined by points instead of dollar amounts.\n\nJames is the one to beat, and that's no secret as he's considered the best aside from host Ken- and won Masters 2023.\n\nBut Yogesh and Victoria - who went on mere three-day and one-day winning streaks, respectively - have clearly come to play.\n\nIn the premiere, Victoria notched a 30,000 runaway that Ken called a \"statement,\" and Yogesh defeated James in a runaway too.\n\nVictoria and James are (or were?) co-stars on the ABC sister show The Chase, one major draw this year.\n\nJames only lost once during Masters last year, so it was especially surprising to see him lose on arrival.\n\nBut James swung back with a huge 46000 win in game two, so he wasn't going to let the rookies coast that easy.\n\nOn Reddit, fans are already predicting a \"Yogesh, James, Victoria top three,\" as others are convinced Victoria will win the whole shebang.\n\nAnother major draw is the rivalry between Yogesh and James.\n\nThe special's \"villains\" grew up in the same area of Michigan and did trivia together and Yogesh also once bragged about being \"better\" than James at high school trivia during his initial run.\n\nJames is a 32-time winner and pro sports better living in Las Vegas - known for his \"all in\" Daily Doubles and huge wins - he won Masters Season 1 in a breeze.\n\nMattea, a 23-time winner, returns as the runner-up and they nearly defeated James in last year's finale.\n\nMatt, a 38-time winner, placed third last year and was the only player to notch a win against James the entire special, but also was \"most inconsistent\".\n\n\"I feel like a stronger competitor,\" Amodio said on his prep at a recent event attended by The U.S. Sun.\n\nAmy, a 40-time champion, placed second-to-last last year and also lost the recent JIT to Victoria - she was chosen as the Producer's Pick due to her popularity.\n\nAmy being named the Producer's Pick wasn't without its drama as she placed bottom of Masters Season 1.\n\nShe also decisively lost the recent Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament to Groce, only for both to move forward to Masters either way.\n\nAmy even acknowledged the backlash on stage in the premiere, \"I do think I belong here, and I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited to be here,\" Schneider said to Jennings.\n\n\"But it also feels like it gives me a little bit something more to prove, that I didn't earn my way back in the same way that the other contestants did.\"\n\nYogesh is a controversial three-day champ who punched his ticket by winning the intense 2024 Tournament of Champions.\n\nVictoria, a mere one-day champ from 2005, qualified by winning the recent Jeopardy's Invitational Tournament against Amy and Andrew He, no small feat.\n\nJeopardy!

Masters despite 'criticism'", "body": "AMY Schneider has shared a brutally candid social media statement addressing being the Producer's Pick for Jeopardy! Masters.\n\nThe 40-time champ -- currently in last place in the special -- was added back into Masters by producers instead of officially qualifying.\n\nJeopardy! Masters Season 2 is upon us, now airing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday across May.\n\nKen Jennings hosts the six-champion special, which determines the best Jeopardy! contestant in any given year.\n\nThe prize is $500,000, an Alex Trebek Trophy, and the ultimate bragging rights.\n\nThe contestants are Amy, reigning champ James Holzhauer, Matt Amodio, Mattea Roach, and newcomers Victoria Groce and Yogesh Raut.\n\nUnlike Masters Season 1 in 2023, this year's lineup is based on the winners of previous events - except for the last spot.\n\nJames, Matt, and Mattea were guaranteed slots by placing top three in Masters Season 1.\n\nVictoria qualified by winning the recent JIT (over Amy) and Yogesh the 2024 Tournament of Champions.\n\nBut Amy was put back in as the Producer's Pick, which caused mixed reactions from fans, as she didn't \"earn her way back.\"\n\nAmy placed fifth in Masters Season 1 and also decisively lost the Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament to Groce, only for both to move forward to Masters either way.\n\nThe decision to go with Amy over a third new player for Masters 2024 did not sit well with all fans.\n\nAnd that was before Masters began, and two episodes, in, she has zero match points and is in sixth place.\n\nAmy wrote on X on Monday, \"I wanted to start by sharing my thoughts on being the \"producer's pick.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm not naive. I am aware that the producers at Jeopardy see me as marketable, and that they think (rightly or wrongly) that it's good for business to have me on their show.\n\n\"And I'm not ashamed of that in itself; I worked hard to show that a trans person could be marketable, and I'm proud to have had some success at that.\n\n\"But that said, I certainly don't want my marketability to undercut the meritocratic spirit of Jeopardy.\n\n\"If I had been the Producer's Pick without being clearly qualified for it, it would have felt wrong, disrespectful to the game I love.\n\n\"Thankfully, however, that situation did not arise. I don't say that I'm the only person who was clearly qualified to be the Producer's Pick.\"\n\nAmy went on to name-check some other deserving candidates, \"Brad Rutter, Ben Chan, and Troy Meyer immediately spring to mind, and a case could be made for a few others.\"\n\nAmy went on to argue that placing second in the JIT to Victoria justified her spot.\n\n\"But that said: The JIT was arguably (only arguably!) the toughest tournament played in the last year, and I came in second in it (and while I'm not a neutral observer, I think it was a deserved second).\n\n\"So I feel I was perfectly qualified to be in consideration.\n\n\"At that point, did marketability concerns give me the edge over other worthy options? Maybe! I wouldn't be surprised if it did.\n\n\"But we all knew the paths to auto-qualify.\n\n\"If I didn't want to feel like my choice was dictated by marketability, then I should have just won the JIT, and I didn't (This, by the way, is entirely normal in individual competition.\n\n\"However, while I didn't feel fraudulent, I did feel like I had to prove that I belonged.\n\n\"I knew that my choice would face some justifiable criticism, and the only way for me to answer it was \"on the court,\" if you will - comparing her selection to pro tennis.\n\n\"Which would be tough, but my confidence was riding high after JIT.\n\n\"I was ready to go down there and test myself against the best in the world, and I intended to show everyone that \"the best in the world\" included Amy Schneider!\"\n\nFans appreciated her honest take on the situation and reacted with their support.\n\n\"A thoughtful and realistic take on the real world,\" one user replied.\n\n\"You do rock I had never even thought about your marketability as a reason why you would be a Producer's Pick, I assumed it was cause you're one of the best!\" wrote another.\n\nA third critic said, \"You keep mentioning it because you know you don't deserve to be there. You lost the Jit.\"\n\nAmy was announced as the last contestant in Masters Season 2 at a live event attended by The U.S. Sun.\n\nBoth at the event and on social media afterward, the choice got a tepid reaction from fans.\n\n\"How do you have a tournament that eliminates people from masters but still pick them...\" one fan reacted to the news.\n\n\"So then what was the point of the JIT,\" asked another.\n\n\"For the record, as a big Amy fan... I'm not a massive fan of this pick. it's kind of a predictable choice and I just don't know if her gameplay will hold up against the other five,\" wrote a third.\n\n\"So then what was the point of the JIT,\" wrote another.\n\n\"What's the point of producer's pick. Everyone else earned their way back,\" wrote one more.\n\nAmy also agreed that last accusation was true during episode one of Masters, \"It gives me a little bit something more to prove, that I didn't earn my way back in the same way that the other contestants did.\"\n\nExecutive Producer Michael Davies discussed the choice at the Inside Jeopardy Live! at Hudson Yards in New York City, where he first revealed Amy as the Producers Pick.\n\n\"I have to prepare myself for the Redditors,\" Davies quipped to the live audience, as The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed. \"So firstly, it's a Producer Pick, but it's not just me. It's all the producers.\"\n\n\"We have to acknowledge there were several worthy people. But one person stood above everybody else,\" he added.\n\n\"I've got to believe they can go on that stage in Masters and beat everybody. Secondly, we're a TV program. We depend on ratings.\"\n\nJames - who lost episode 1 to Yogesh- finished Double Jeopardy with 45200, the highest score of Masters history.\n\nIn Game 2, Amy faced last week's winners Victoria and Yogesh.\n\nVictoria found the last Daily Double and aced it as \"Hoover\" bringing her to 33600 and a runaway.\n\nBy the end of Double Jeopardy Victoria had a stunning 41000 runaway, Yogesh 11800 and Amy 10200- which meant Amy once again finished last place.\n\n\"We knew Victoria would be good but WOW,\" one fan wrote.\n\nAnother lamented, \"Amy's confidence is so shot. 40 games and second-place finishes in JIT are sooooo commendable chin up babes!\"\n\nAn additional fan wrote, \"Imagine if the Producer's Pick ends up in 6th place lol,\" referring to Amy.\n\nOne more wrote, \"She most likely will.

Masters' Night Three: Has Victoria Groce Become the 'Final Boss'?", "body": "At the start of Jeopardy! Masters Season 2, Season 1 champ James Holzhauer declared that he was the \"final boss\" of the entire competition, but so far, it's been the Victoria Groce show, through and through.\n\nIn the third night of competition -- for Games 5 and 6 on Wednesday, May 8 -- Groce once again took the lead and held it. And although it wasn't a runaway this time (for the first time in Masters' second season so far), she still had a commanding performance. So is Victoria Groce the new \"final boss\" of this season? Well, there's still a lot of gameplay to go, but she's off to a good start.\n\nComing into the night, the tallies of match powers were: Victoria Groce in 1st place with 6, James Holzhauer in 2nd place with 4, Yogesh Raut in third place with 4 (because of the tiebreaker being the number of correct responses), Matt Amodio in 4th with 1, Mattea Roach in 5th with 1 point, and Amy Schneider trailing in 6th with 0.\n\nHere's a look at everything that happened on night three of Jeopardy! Masters Season 2.\n\nGame Five\n\nThe first match-up saw Amy Schneider, Matt Amodio, and Yogesh Raut going head-to-head. Raut came in with one win and a second-place finish under his belt, while Amodio had just one second-place finish, and Schneider had none.\n\nIt didn't take long for Raut to forge his way to frontrunner status, earning $5,400 in the first round, with Schneider pulling up the rear with $4,600 and Amodio earning $2,200. (Note: Amodio did get the Daily Double; in the category \"European Geography,\" the clue was, \"A palace in this city in Provence is a reminder of its role in the Catholic church in the 14th Century. Amodio wagered $1,000 -- the most he could due to being in the red -- and guessed \"Avignon.\")\n\nThough all the contestants kept it close enough in the first round, Double Jeopardy was an absolute trouncing. While Amodio did get another Daily Double (and correctly guessed that a pangolin is the described scaly cousin of an anteater), Raut got the second and bet the whole house, which was already $15,400 at that point. Raut doubled his score by correctly guessing that O'Brien from 1984 was the character who taunted Winston about being betrayed immediately.\n\nRelated'Jeopardy!': Amy Schneider Speaks Out Amid 'Masters' Appearance Backlash\n\nThus, going into Final Jeopardy, it was yet another runaway with a race for that singular second-place match point: Raut came in with $36,400, while Schneider had $12,200, and Amodio had $7,200.\n\nThe Final Jeopardy category was \"The Theater,\" and the clue was, \"This show debuted December 30, 1879, in a theater on the Devon Coast, with the cast in costumes from a related show.\"\n\nPerhaps ironically, Raut was the one person who didn't get it right -- the answer: Pirates of Penzance -- but he wisely wagered nothing and kept his lead at $36,400, with Schneider taking second (and earning her first match point) with $14,401, just $1 more than Amodio's final score of $14,400.\n\nGame Six\n\nThe second game featured Mattea Roach, James Holzhauer, and Victoria Groce -- the first meeting of the two The Chase stars in the competition.\n\nHolzhauer had a great start and even found the Daily Double in the first round, but he got the answer wrong after being \"all the cheddar\" -- costing him a gutting $5,800. (The clue, in the category of \"Starts and Ends with R,\" was, \"This device allows air to get from a scuba diver's oxygen tanks & into the diver's lungs.\" While Holzhauer did have a guess that matched the category parameters -- \"What is 'respirator'?\" -- the answer was, \"Regular.\")\n\nThus, Groce's $6,000 from the round was enough to head into Double Jeopardy in front, with both Holzhauer and Roach trailing at $1,400.\n\nMore from this section Mortal Kombat 1 Official Homelander First Look Teaser Trailer Lady Gaga Announces 'The Chromatica Ball' Film Ingression Official Launch Trailer\n\nIn Double Jeopardy, Groce pulled a power move upon finding a Daily Double, echoing Holzhauer by pressing her hands forward and saying, \"I believe the move is 'all-in,'\" putting her entire $14,000 prize pot on the line. Holzhauer cheekily replied with, \"Poor technique. Good strategy, though.\" Indeed it was that; in the category \"They Did Bad,\" Groce correctly guessed that Machine Gun Kelly was the person \"nicknamed for a lethal weapon regulated by Congress in 1934\" who didn't kill anyone but did kidnap.\n\nStill, impressive though her performance was, host Ken Jennings happily noted, \"Look at this! For the first time in this competition, first place is not a foregone conclusion as we head into Final Jeopardy.\"\n\nFor Game 6's Final Jeopardy round, the category was \"Famous Last Words,\" and the clue was, \"In 1530, he made his last confession and wished that 'I had served God as diligently as I have done the king.'\"\n\nNot a single one of the masters correctly guessed it the answers -- they all guessed Thomas More, although the answer was Cardinal Wosley -- so it came down to the betting strategy. Groce put just $5,601 on the line, so she finished with $23,999; Holzhauer lost $6,400, taking his score down to $11,200; and Roach wagered all $7,000 of their money and ended with $0.\n\nAnd with that, the new leaderboard scores are as follows:\n\n1st = Victoria Groce - 3 tonight, 9 total\n\n2nd = Yogesh Raut - 3 tonight, 7 total\n\n3rd = James Holzhauer - 1 tonight, 5 total\n\n4th = Matt Amodio - 0 tonight, 1 total*\n\n5th = Amy Schneider - 1 tonight, 1 total\n\n6th = Mattea Roach - 0 tonight, 1 total\n\n*Tiebreaker is the number of correct responses.\n\nJeopardy!

Allison led into Final Jeopardy with $11,800, while Matthew had $7,000 and Daniel had $2,000.\n\nFinal Jeopardy! under \"FAMOUS CHARACTERS\" read, \"She's introduced in an 1845 novella in which she wears a short skirt with her mantilla thrown back to show her shoulders.\"\n\nOnly Daniel was correct with \"Carmen\", but Allison played it safe, dropping $2,201 to win with $9,599.\n\nAllison will now face two new challengers tomorrow night to see if she can join Alison Betts in becoming our next streaker named Allison.\n\nDaniel's Daily Double, meanwhile, was an easter egg that not all casual viewers may have been clued in on.\n\nUnder \"PRONUNCIATION ADVICE\" Ken read, \"It became a Canadian province in 1949 & poet E.J. Pratt advised, accent on the last syllable, swallow the 1st D.\"\n\nOne Redditor noticed, \"I believe Ken got into an online squabble about this, so DD2 seemed to be a callback to that.\"\n\nIndeed, as the clue and Ken seemed to be referring, the host got into a social media tussle with a fan last year when he was accused of mispronouncing \"Newfoundland.\"\n\nDuring the episode, Ken said \"New-fin-lind\" instead of \"New-fin-land,\" which caused Canadian critics to come out of the woodwork.\n\nOne fan wrote on X, \"OMG NO!!! He did not pronounce Newfoundland properly AGAIN.\"\n\nAnother person wrote, \"Newfoundland rhymes with understand.\"\n\nA third disgruntled viewer tagged Ken personally and wrote: \"For next time @KenJennings ... Newfoundland rhymes with understand. \"Newfoundland-understand, emphasis on land. Love the show. You're doing a great job.\"\n\nKen replied personally in a response he quickly, deleted, writing, \"Not in the U.S. it doesn't. Maybe on Newfie Jeopardy! someday they'll say it your way.\"\n\nKen also linked to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, backing up that he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nHowever, \"Newfie\" is a term used to describe people from Newfoundland, which, according to the CBC, is divisive when outsiders use it.\n\nThe fan replied to Ken, \"Wow. If your source knew anything about Newfoundland and Labrador, it would know that many people in this province will find your use of Newfie as insulting as it is disappointing.\"\n\n\"Please get the producers to play a few old tapes to find out how Alex (properly) pronounced it.\"\n\nKen then responded once more: \"It's not up to me! That's Merriam-Webster you're arguing with.\"\n\nOther viewers appreciated Jeopardy! rehashing the past in a subtle yet hilarious way.\n\nThe prize is $500,000, an Alex Trebek Trophy, and the ultimate bragging rights.\n\nIn Game 1, Mattea faced Matt and \"self-proclaimed final boss\" reigning champ James (a rematch of last year's Masters finale).\n\nJames - who lost episode 1 to Yogesh - finished Double Jeopardy with 45200, the highest score of Masters history.\n\nFans flooded social media dazzled by James' massive win, though some admitted they were expecting a joke Final Jeopardy answer with a runaway.\n\nIn fact, aside from his name being written in Japanese on his podium, there were no jokes on the board from James who seemed hellbent on just winning.\n\n\"I thought James might come up with an unhinged message,\" joked a third surprised by James' seriousness.\n\nA fourth agreed, \"I'm a little sad we haven't had a pro wrestling taunt intro or a joke Final Jeopardy response from James this year.

Amy is super smart and likable and one of my favorite players but she just isn't on the same level as the others.\"\n\n\"I feel horrible for Amy,\" wrote yet another and \"Yeah, she's having a rough tournament.\"\n\nThe standings now are as follows: Victoria leads with 6 match points, James has 4, Yogesh has 4, Matt has 1, Mattea has 1, and Amy has 0.\n\nJeopardy! airs at 7 pm ET while Jeopardy!

While James is known for cracking jokes with host Ken Jennings and his fellow contestants, viewers saw a different, more intense version of James heading into the game, ready to do whatever it took to get to the next round.\n\nWith this new approach on screen, James shocked everyone when he decided to bet $20,000 of his earlier earnings on the final Daily Double of the night, per TVInsider. To everyone's surprise, when he correctly answered the clue, his earnings went from $25,200 to a whopping $45,200 -- the highest score in Jeopardy! Masters history before heading into Final Jeopardy. And when he correctly guessed that clue (which was in the category of \"20th Century Leaders\"), he managed to earn a whopping $46,108 (having bet $908) and win the entire game.\n\nAfter seeing James' historic Jeopardy! Masters performance in real-time, viewers couldn't help but comment on what happened online.\n\n\"@Jeopardy Man what a dominating performance by @James_Holzhauer. No wonder why he's nicknamed the Final Boss.

Schneider came in third.\n\nDuring \"Jeopardy Masters,\" the winner of each game scores three points; the second-place finisher earns one point; and the third-place player gets zero points.\n\nGoing into tonight's round, the \"Jeopardy Masters\" leaderboard has Monday's results, shows Groce at the top, with six points; Holzhauer in second, with four points; Raut in third, also with four points (Holzhauer is ahead of Raut because of a tiebreaker rule, which takes into account the number of correct answers a contestant offers); Amodio in fourth place, with one point; Roach in fifth place, with one point; and Schneider in sixth place, with zero points.", "source": {"uri": "oregonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oregon Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Schneider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Schneider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Amodio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Amodio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattea_Roach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattea Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Holzhauer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Holzhauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Dominoes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Dominoes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/6OKJHZU62NDSHG2PB2PTHK5RUE.jpg?auth=25ac6cb4f73108d4839fb2642c9ebc879f386ec39538fdf7ed80bf695f3322cf&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550548", "eventUri": "eng-9550548", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 891, "textEnd": 896, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Masters Season 2 is in full swing, now airing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday across May.\n\nThe prize is $500,000, an Alex Trebek Trophy, and the ultimate bragging rights.\n\nSo far, only Victoria (winner of the recent Invitational), Yogesh (winner of the 2024 Tournament of Champions), and James have won games.\n\nFans said it's abundantly clear they will be the finalists already and that breakout star Victoria will likely win.\n\nIn addition, there's been much less humor between the players - especially from James, who has lost twice and has not made any joke Final Jeopardy answers as expected.\n\nA Facebook user started a thread, \"So, I abolutely love Jeopardy! Masters but does anyone else agree that last year's tournament was so much more fun?\n\n\"Last year's contestants had an amazing amount of chemistry, possibly due to both Andrew and Sam!\"\n\n\"Again, I don't want to minimize this year's tournament and I really like each of this year's contestants.

I thought it was horrible!\"\n\nOthers shared their disdain in the game thread, thinking that for Masters, this might have been fair game with a rewrite.\n\n\"Seriously... I had Rigoletto immediately, but had no idea what they were going for as a 'rhyme.' If I'd been playing, I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from going 'Oh, f**k off\" on stage,'\" wrote another.\n\n\"Allison deserves a medal for putting a guess that fits the FJ category, even if it's known as Don Giovanni on the stage,\" remarked a fourth.\n\n\"One of the worst ever for regular season play, I'd contend. I feel bad for the contestants; it's got to be kind of crushing to get something like that when you're hoping for a little redemption on a correct FJ response,\" echoed a fifth.\n\nA sixth agreed, \"I honestly feel bad for the contestants. What a horrendous, horrendous clue.\"\n\nFive-day champ Alison Betts also joined the chorus of criticism, \"I found this FJ super challenging! I got to Rigoletto immediately but then spent the rest of the time wondering if I was missing some other opera that had an internal rhyme, or whose title was rhyming words.\"\n\nRegardless, Allison 2.0 will face two new challengers, hopefully with a less brutal final clue tomorrow night.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeopardy! Masters Season 2 will return with its third episode tonight.\n\nThe tournament is now airing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday across May - so fans are getting 1.5 hours of Jeopardy! goodness.\n\nKen hosts the six-champion special, which determines the best contestant in any given year. The prize is $500,000, an Alex Trebek Trophy, and the ultimate bragging rights.\n\nThe contestants are reigning champ James Holzhauer, Matt Amodio, Mattea Roach, Amy Schneider, and newcomers Victoria Groce and Yogesh Raut.\n\nVictoria, a mere one-day champ from 2005, qualified by winning the recent Invitational tournament.\n\nShe has proven to be a buzzsaw, as she is the only Master with two out of two wins after the first two episodes, putting her in first place.\n\nTonight she faces James Holzhauer, her fellow co-star on The Chase, who is in second place alongside poor Mattea.\n\nIn the episode other match, Amy will face Matt and Yogesh - currently tied for second with four match points.\n\nMasters began on May 1 and is scheduled to conclude with a grand finale on May 22.\n\nFear not, show traditionalists, as Masters will not interfere with regular gameplay, and both will air those nights.\n\nEach Masters episode consists of two half-hour games, and the winner of each is awarded three points, while the runner-up receives one.\n\nThe four players with the most points will then advance to the semifinals, and the top three competitors will face off in finals.\n\nOn Reddit, fans are already predicting a \"Yogesh, James, Victoria top three,\" as others are convinced Victoria will win the whole shebang.\n\nMeanwhile, an Amy win would be crucial tonight as she has 0 points overall.\n\nJeopardy! Masters continues on Wednesday, May 8 with matches 5 and 6 on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darian_lusk@the-sun.com", "name": "Darian Lusk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigoletto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rigoletto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ken Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Libretto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roseanne Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Maria_Piave", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francesco Maria Piave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Don Juan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Giovanni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don Giovanni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giuseppe Verdi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattea_Roach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mattea Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!

Masters' Night Three: Has Victoria Groce Become the 'Final Boss'?", "body": "At the start of Jeopardy! Masters Season 2, Season 1 champ James Holzhauer declared that he was the \"final boss\" of the entire competition, but so far, it's been the Victoria Groce show, through and through.\n\nIn the third night of competition -- for Games 5 and 6 on Wednesday, May 8 -- Groce once again took the lead and held it. And although it wasn't a runaway this time (for the first time in Masters' second season so far), she still had a commanding performance. So is Victoria Groce the new \"final boss\" of this season? Well, there's still a lot of gameplay to go, but she's off to a good start.\n\nComing into the night, the tallies of match powers were: Victoria Groce in 1st place with 6, James Holzhauer in 2nd place with 4, Yogesh Raut in third place with 4 (because of the tiebreaker being the number of correct responses), Matt Amodio in 4th with 1, Mattea Roach in 5th with 1 point, and Amy Schneider trailing in 6th with 0.\n\nIt didn't take long for Raut to forge his way to frontrunner status, earning $5,400 in the first round, with Schneider pulling up the rear with $4,600 and Amodio earning $2,200. (Note: Amodio did get the Daily Double; in the category \"European Geography,\" the clue was, \"A palace in this city in Provence is a reminder of its role in the Catholic church in the 14th Century. Amodio wagered $1,000 -- the most he could due to being in the red -- and guessed \"Avignon.\")\n\nThough all the contestants kept it close enough in the first round, Double Jeopardy was an absolute trouncing. While Amodio did get another Daily Double (and correctly guessed that a pangolin is the described scaly cousin of an anteater), Raut got the second and bet the whole house, which was already $15,400 at that point. Raut doubled his score by correctly guessing that O'Brien from 1984 was the character who taunted Winston about being betrayed immediately.\n\nThus, going into Final Jeopardy, it was yet another runaway with a race for that singular second-place match point: Raut came in with $36,400, while Schneider had $12,200, and Amodio had $7,200.\n\nThe Final Jeopardy category was \"The Theater,\" and the clue was, \"This show debuted December 30, 1879, in a theater on the Devon Coast, with the cast in costumes from a related show.\"\n\nPerhaps ironically, Raut was the one person who didn't get it right -- the answer: Pirates of Penzance -- but he wisely wagered nothing and kept his lead at $36,400, with Schneider taking second (and earning her first match point) with $14,401, just $1 more than Amodio's final score of $14,400.\n\nThe second game featured Mattea Roach, James Holzhauer, and Victoria Groce -- the first meeting of the two The Chase stars in the competition.\n\nHolzhauer had a great start and even found the Daily Double in the first round, but he got the answer wrong after being \"all the cheddar\" -- costing him a gutting $5,800. (The clue, in the category of \"Starts and Ends with R,\" was, \"This device allows air to get from a scuba diver's oxygen tanks & into the diver's lungs.\" While Holzhauer did have a guess that matched the category parameters -- \"What is 'respirator'?\" -- the answer was, \"Regular.\")\n\nThus, Groce's $6,000 from the round was enough to head into Double Jeopardy in front, with both Holzhauer and Roach trailing at $1,400.\n\nIn Double Jeopardy, Groce pulled a power move upon finding a Daily Double, echoing Holzhauer by pressing her hands forward and saying, \"I believe the move is 'all-in,'\" putting her entire $14,000 prize pot on the line. Holzhauer cheekily replied with, \"Poor technique. Good strategy, though.\" Indeed it was that; in the category \"They Did Bad,\" Groce correctly guessed that Machine Gun Kelly was the person \"nicknamed for a lethal weapon regulated by Congress in 1934\" who didn't kill anyone but did kidnap.\n\nStill, impressive though her performance was, host Ken Jennings happily noted, \"Look at this! For the first time in this competition, first place is not a foregone conclusion as we head into Final Jeopardy.\"\n\nFor Game 6's Final Jeopardy round, the category was \"Famous Last Words,\" and the clue was, \"In 1530, he made his last confession and wished that 'I had served God as diligently as I have done the king.'\"\n\nNot a single one of the masters correctly guessed it the answers -- they all guessed Thomas More, although the answer was Cardinal Wosley -- so it came down to the betting strategy. Groce put just $5,601 on the line, so she finished with $23,999; Holzhauer lost $6,400, taking his score down to $11,200; and Roach wagered all $7,000 of their money and ended with $0.\n\nAnd with that, the new leaderboard scores are as follows:", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_bell@tvinsider.com", "name": "Amanda Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Holzhauer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Holzhauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattea_Roach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mattea Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!

This time, Vancouver's Yogesh Raut faced off against Victoria Groce and Amy Schneider for the second game in the episode.\n\n(No cable or satellite? You can stream \"Jeopardy Masters\" via Fubo, which offers a free trial.)\n\nThat combination saw Raut and Groce, who both won in their first appearances in \"Jeopardy Masters,\" competing against each other. The third player in their round, Amy Schneider, also competed against Raut in the previous episode, though Schneider finished third in that game, behind Raut and James Holzhauer, who came in second.\n\nThe \"Jeopardy Masters\" format features six contestants, who compete in a series of hour-long episodes, which include two games, with three masters competing in each game. The winner of each game scores three points; the second-place finisher earns one point; and the third-place player gets zero points.\n\nMonday's installment began with Game 3, which saw Holzhauer, described as the \"final boss\" of \"Jeopardy!,\" playing against Mattea Roach, a writer and podcast host from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Matt Amodio, a quantitative researcher from New York.\n\nIt was an entertaining game, with Amodio doing well, and Holzhauer securing the lead, thanks in part to \"Daily Double\" wins. When \"Final Jeopardy\" arrived, Holzhauer was in first place, with 45,200; Amodio was in second, with 19,200; and Roach was in third, with 5,600.\n\nThe category was \"20th Century Leaders,\" and the clue was: \"One of the 'Big Four' at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and a former journalist, he'd supported the Impressionists and Alfred Dreyfus.\"\n\nAll three players had the correct response, guessing, \"Who is (Georges) Clemenceau?\" Roach bet 158, bringing their total to 5,758; Amodio bet zero, leaving his total at 19,200; and Holzhauer wagered 908, raising his total to a whopping 46,108.\n\nThat left Holzhauer with three points for the win; Amodio with one point for placing second; and Roach with zero, for a third-place finish.\n\nThe three players who accumulate the most match points over the three-week \"Jeopardy Masters\" tournament will advance to the finals. The ultimate winner of \"Jeopardy Masters\" will take home a grand prize of $500,000.\n\nGame 4 came up next. Raut, a cognitive and behavioral scientist who won the 2024 \"Jeopardy!\" Tournament of Champions and the $250,000 grand prize, competed against Groce, a writer and television personality from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Schneider, a writer from Oakland, California.\n\nGroce again showed her strength as a player, and she also got a boost from \"Daily Double\" wins. When it was time for \"Final Jeopardy,\" Groce was in the lead, with 41,000; Raut was in second, with 11,800; and Schneider was in third, with 10,200.\n\nThe \"Final Jeopardy\" category was \"20th Century Writers,\" and the clue was: \"Becoming British subject in 1927, he described himself as a classicist in literature, Royalist in politics and Anglo-Catholic in religion.\"\n\nSchneider had the correct answer with, \"Who is T.S. Eliot?\" She wagered 1,601, raising her total to 11,801. Raut also had the right answer, and his wager of 8,601 raised his total to 20,401. Groce had an incorrect response, guessing \"Who is Tolkien?\" Groce wagered 9,000, which dropped her total to 32,000, but that was still enough to secure a win for Groce.\n\nThe \"Jeopardy Masters\" leaderboard, as of Monday's results, shows Groce at the top, with her two 3-point wins; Holzhauer is in second, with 4 points; Raut is in third, also with 4 points (Holzhauer is ahead of Raut because of a tiebreaker rule, which takes into account the number of correct answers a contestant offers); Amodio is in fourth place, with one match point; Roach is in fifth place, with zero points; and Schneider is in sixth place, also with zero points.", "source": {"uri": "oregonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oregon Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Schneider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amy Schneider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Holzhauer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Holzhauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattea_Roach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattea Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Amodio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Amodio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919\u20131920)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dreyfus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alfred Dreyfus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Clemenceau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georges Clemenceau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impressionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_subject", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British subject"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Masters' Episode 3: Amy Schneider gains momentum, delivers ode to Dayton", "body": "The Oakland, California writer and winner of the 2022 Tournament of Champions is among the super champs vying for trivia glory: reigning \"Masters\" winner James Holzhauer; Season 1 \"Masters\" finalists Matt Amodio and Mattea Roach; 2024 Tournament of Champions winner Yogesh Raut; and 2024 Invitational Tournament winner Victoria Groce. Schneider, the runner-up in the Invitational Tournament, was specifically chosen as a Producers Pick.\n\nOver the course of three weeks, nine one-hour episodes will feature two games among different combinations of the contestants, resulting in a champion who will win a $500,000 grand prize and the \"Jeopardy! Masters\" title.\n\nWednesday's episode featured Schneider against Raut, a cognitive and behavioral scientist from Vancouver, Washington, and Amodio, a quantitative researcher from New York, New York.\n\nBenefitting from Raut and Amodio's slow starts, Schneider, looking more assured and particularly more comfortable with her buzzer, began the Jeopardy! round smoothly out front, finishing in second with 4,600 points. She trailed Raut, who rebounded with 5,400, but led Amodio, who had 2,200.\n\nDuring Double Jeopardy!, the impressive Raut dominated, raising his score to 36,400 points. Even so, Schneider remained steady, easing into second with 12,200 followed by Amodio with 7,200.\n\nThe Final Jeopardy! clue in the category The Theater:\n\n\"This show debuted December 30, 1879 in a theater on the Devon Coast, with the cast in costumes from a related show.\"\n\nSchneider correctly responded \"The Pirates of Penzance,\" wagered 2,201 and finished with 14,401. Amodio also answered correctly, wagered 7,200 and finished with 14,400. Raut did not respond or wager, leaving his total at 36,400.\n\nDuring the interview portion, host Ken Jennings asked Schneider to reflect on her Dayton roots, particularly a song she wrote during her upbringing.\n\n\"I love Dayton, I'm proud of it, I also did move away from it eventually,\" Schneider said. \"So, I wrote a song that was hopefully, lovingly, mocking it.\"\n\nThe lyrics:\n\n\"There are those who say that Kitty Hawk was the home of the Wright brothers\n\nIn Dayton we despise these folk more than any others\n\nDetroit may have their bike shop and their plane is in D.C.\n\nBut Dayton's got their corpses and that's good enough for me.\"\n\n\"It's a good mnemonic for tourists to remember which sites they can see, apparently the Wright brothers grave,\" Jennings said.\n\n\"It's a very beautiful cemetery,\" replied Schneider, referencing Woodland Cemetery.\n\nThe leaderboard at the end of the third episode: First: Groce (9); Second: Raut (7); Third: Holzhauer: (5); Fourth: Amodio: (1); Fifth: Schneider (1); and Sixth: Roach (1). The ranking takes into account the number of correct responses.\n\n\"Jeopardy! Masters\" returns Friday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Masters kicked off last week with six of the game's most elite players battling it out for the coveted title and $500,000 grand prize. Those competing include reigning Masters champ James Holzhauer, last year's runners-up Matt Amodio & Mattea Roach, 2024 Tournament of Champions winner Yogesh Raut, and Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament winner Victoria Groce.\n\nThe sixth and final spot went to Schneider as a Producers' Pick, despite placing fifth in Masters Season 1 and losing the JIT! to Groce. Some fans felt the spot should have gone to someone else who hasn't had as many opportunities as Schneider.\n\n\"We just saw her in JIT, whats the point if she can lose that and just move on anyways,\" said one commenter on the Jeopardy! Reddit forum when the line-up was first announced. \"The 'sport' of Jeopardy: You can lose two opportunities to get into the Masters and be invited anyway! Mind-boggling decision.\"\n\nOn Monday (May 7), Schneider took to social media to address the criticism and share her thoughts on being selected as the Producers' Pick.\n\n\"I wanted to start by sharing my thoughts on being the \"producer's pick,\"\" she wrote on X. \"Look, I'm not naive. I am aware that the producers at Jeopardy see me as marketable, and that they think (rightly or wrongly) that it's good for business to have me on their show.\"\n\n\"And I'm not ashamed of that in itself; I worked hard to show that a trans person *could* be marketable, and I'm proud to have had some success at that,\" she continued.\n\n\"But that said, I certainly don't want my marketability to undercut the meritocratic spirit of Jeopardy,\" she added. \"If I had been the Producer's Pick without being clearly qualified for it, it would have felt wrong, disrespectful to the game I love. Thankfully, however, that situation did not arise.\"\n\nSchneider's track record speaks for itself. With 40 straight wins, she holds the second-longest consecutive win streak after Ken Jennings and the fourth all-time winnings record behind Brad Rutter, Jennings, and Holzhauer. She also won the 2022 Tournament of Champions and finished as runner-up in the JIT!\n\nShe went on to mention some other candidates who would have made great Producers' Picks, including Rutter, Ben Chan, and Troy Meyer.\n\nBut, she argued, her second-place finish in the JIT! more than qualified her for the position.\n\n\"The JIT was arguably (only arguably!) the toughest tournament played in the last year, and I came in second in it (and while I'm not a neutral observer, I think it was a deserved second),\" she wrote. \"So I feel I was perfectly qualified to be in consideration.\"\n\nShe added, \"At that point, did marketability concerns give me the edge over other worthy options? Maybe! I wouldn't be surprised if it did. But we all knew the paths to auto-qualify. If I didn't want to feel like my choice was dictated by marketability, then I should have just won the JIT, and I didn't.\"\n\nWhile Schneider said she felt her spot on Masters was earned, she did note how she also felt \"like I had to *prove* that I belonged. I knew that my choice would face some justifiable criticism, and the only way for me to answer it was \"on the court,\" if you will.\"\n\n\"I was ready to go down there and test myself against the best in the world, and I intended to show everyone that \"the best in the world\" included Amy Schneider!\" she concluded.\n\n\"The best in the world absolutely includes Amy Schneider!\" one fan responded to Schneider's message.\n\n\"Personally, I was EXTREMELY HAPPY you were chosen,\" added another. \"You're a great player, you've won the TOC, and did wonderfully in JIT. You're very watchable and have a lot of personality. The Producer's Pick was a good one!!\"\n\nAnother wrote, \"A thoughtful and realistic take on the real world. You do rock.\"\n\n\"I had never even thought about your marketability as a reason why you would be a Producer's Pick, I assumed it was cause you're one of the best!\" said another.\n\nAfter two games, Schneider currently sits at the bottom of the leaderboard with zero points. Groce leads the charge with six points, while Holzhaur and Raut sit in second and third with four points each. Amodio and Roach take up spots four and five with one point apiece.", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_holmes@tvinsider.com", "name": "Martin Holmes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattea_Roach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mattea Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!

About five clues into DJ she flatlined,\" wrote another.\n\n\"I don't know if her confidence deflated after the J round or the DJ categories weren't in her wheelhouse. I'd like to see her get a Second Chance.\"\n\nAnother wrote, \"If not for that perhaps overly confident all-in DD, Isabella might have ousted Allison. She came close, which made for good gameplay. But Allison was more conservative with her DD wagers, and I'm glad she came away with a little more money today.\"\n\nA third wrote, \"A shame what happened to Isabella on DD1 -- going for the early KO isn't the worst strategy -- but at least it would not have changed the outcome.\"\n\nA fourth wrote, \"2024 must be a good year to be named Allison or Alison!\"\n\n\"The Season of the Woman continues! Victoria, Alison, Amy... and Allison coming on strong!\" a fifth declared.\n\nAllison will face two more challengers tomorrow night for win four, which would all but qualify her for the next Tournament of Champions.\n\nIn game one, Yogesh - who boasted about the laundry list of contestants he's had on his podcast - won his second match.\n\nIn game two, breakout star Victoria defeated fellow Chaser James and Mattea to her third win remaining undefeated.\n\nNow, Victoria has 9 points, Yogesh 7, James 5, Matt, Amy and Mattea have 1.\n\nVictoria, a mere one-day champ from 2005, qualified by winning the recent Invitational tournament, and she's proven to be a buzzsaw who may dethrone James.\n\nThat said, some fans are finding the special a little lackluster this year regarding the wow factor since it's clear who the top three will be.\n\nAs one Redditor wrote, \"One thing this night for sure confirmed: Victoria, James and Yogesh are leagues above the other 3, and if someone who isn't one of them makes the Top 3 (although I think Victoria is mathematically guaranteed to be in the finals at this rate) it would be a massive upset.\"\n\nAnother wrote, \"Hot take: daily doubles have made this tournament extremely boring.

{"id": 231373544, "title": "Three UConn women&#8217;s basketball stars headed for Paris Olympics; Caitlin Clark left off final roster", "text": "Caitlin Clark won\u2019t be headed to the Paris Olympics, according to a person familiar with the decision. The person, who provided the full roster to The Associated Press, spoke on condition of anonymity Saturday because no official announcement has been made. The decision was first reported by The Athletic. While Clark won\u2019t be headed to Paris, the U.S. is expected to take three former UConn women\u2019s basketball stars including five-time gold medalist Diana Taurasi for a sixth Olympics. Taurasi will be joined by former Huskies Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, as well as her Phoenix Mercury teammate Brittney Griner. Also on the roster is Connecticut Sun superstar Alyssa Thomas. Clark does have some international experience with USA Basketball at a younger level, but she couldn\u2019t attend the national training camp in Cleveland after she was invited because she was leading Iowa to the Final Four. Clark finished her career as the NCAA\u2019s Division I all-time scoring leader. Clark, now a rookie with the Indiana Fever, has drawn millions of new fans to women\u2019s basketball in her college career and also in her young WNBA career. This will be Griner\u2019s first time playing internationally since she was detained in a Russian prison for 10 months in 2022. She said she\u2019ll only play abroad with USA Basketball. The rest of the reported roster includes Olympic veterans A\u2019ja Wilson, Jewell Loyd and Chelsea Gray. Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, who helped the U.S. win the inaugural 3\u00d73 gold medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021, also will be on the team as will Sabrina Ionescu and Kahleah Copper. The U.S. women have won every gold medal in women\u2019s basketball since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Taurasi, who turns 42 before the Paris Games, will break the record for most Olympics played in the sport of basketball. Five players, including former teammate Sue Bird, have competed in five. The U.S. team will train together for a few days in Phoenix in July. Then its off to London for an exhibition game against Germany before heading to France. The Americans will play Japan, Belgium and Germany in pool play at the Olympics.", "summary": "Three former UConn women's basketball stars -- Diana Taurasi, Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart -- as well as Sun superstar Alyssa Thomas will be headed to the Paris Olympics.

The IDF said the rescued hostages \u2014 Noa Argamani, 25; Almog Meir Jan, 21; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 40 \u2014 were in good medical condition and have been transferred to the Sheba Tel-HaShomer Medical Center for further examinations. Hamas kidnapped some 250 hostages during its attack on southern Israel in October. About half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November, according to reports. The hostages, who were kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival during the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, were rescued in two separate locations in Nuseirat, the IDF said. One Israeli special forces soldier was reportedly killed during the operation. \"We will continue to make every effort to bring the hostages home,\" the IDF said. Israel says more than 130 captives remain, with about a quarter of those believed dead, and divisions are deepening in the country over the best way to bring them home. Saturday\u2019s operation was the largest recovery of alive hostages since the war began, bringing the total of rescued captives to seven. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Israeli forces for operating \"creatively and bravely\" in the rescue operation. We will not let up until we complete the mission and return home all the hostages \u2014 both those alive and dead,\" Netanyahu said.", "summary": "It was not immediately clear if the hostage freeings and the air assault were related, but both took place in Nuseirat in central Gaza.", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-palestine-hostages-gaza-airstrikes-death/", "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=675,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08/GettyImages-2155794597-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:49:52", "author": "Jones Hayden", "authors": ["Jones Hayden"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "eu", "sentiment": 0.118}

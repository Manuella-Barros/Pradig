\"lies spread through social media\" and \"we need to do something about that\".\n\nOn X far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, spent the weekend posting inflammatory messages to thousands of followers, all from the safety of a sun lounger in Cyprus.\n\nRobinson was handed back his X account last November by the social media firm's billionaire owner Elon Musk.\n\nMr Musk himself posted this weekend where he said civil war in the UK was \"inevitable\".\n\nX has not replied to the BBC's requests for comment.\n\nFor Mr Basu, social media companies \"only respond\" to two things: a change in the law or advertisers pulling out because they do not want to be associated with \"platforms that would allow lies that result in violence and sheer terror in communities\".\n\nThe targeting of hotels believed to be housing migrants comes after years of demonisation by the far right with lists of hotels shared on social media, making it hard to know where might be struck next.\n\nMr Basu said \"we should be appealing\" to advertisers to cut the funding of social media giants if responsibility was not exercised.\n\nHe also said there were gaps in the laws relating to hateful extremism which needed to be filled, particularly to stop Robinson \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\n\"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service.\"\n\nMr Basu said he had \"spent many years skirting round various fringes of the law\" and had been able to \"inflame and toxify debates and create the kind of mayhem we're seeing\".\n\n\"If he is not crossing a legal threshold, then the government and

the riot.\n\nPassfield added: \"This was large-scale mob violence which resulted in fear to the public and damage to local businesses.\"\n\nCops kicked down Hodgson's front door on Saturday before hauling her out in her underwear.\n\nIn footage released by Northumbria Police, officers are seen kicking in a glass door at an address in Sunderland on Saturday morning.\n\nA female officer is seen thumping on the door shouting: \"Police, open the door!\" while her colleagues scale the garden fence.\n\nThe female officer then tells another cop: \"There's someone in, can you put the door through?\"\n\nA male officer then boots the glass panel before cops swarm inside the end-terraced property.\n\nMinutes later Hodgson is led out in handcuffs while still wearing a pink and black lacy nightie\n\nTwo men who were involved in the Sunderland riot also pleaded guilty to violent disorder today.\n\nJosh Kellett, 29, from nearby Washington, admitted the offence at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.\n\nAndrew Smith, 41, from Sunderland, admitted the same offence at Newcastle Crown Court.\n\nThe two men will be sentenced along with Hodgson at Newcastle Crown Court next month.\n\nAll three offenders have been remanded in custody ahead of their sentencing.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Graeme Barr said: \"All three individuals should be ashamed of their actions and I am pleased that they have been convicted at court.\n\n\"A comprehensive investigation is well underway as we look to identify those responsible for the disorder.\"\n\nBarr added: \"We will ensure they are faced with the full force of the law.\n\n\"We will continue to pursue every investigative avenue in order to bring justice against those involved, and further activity is planned.\"\n\nIt comes as far-right thugs are plotting to attack 39 immigration centres and have shared a sick 'arson manual' in a vile online forum.\n\nA Telegram group with more than 14,000 members lists details of immigration lawyers, charities and advice centres across England.\n\nEvil far-right agitators have posted instructions in the group telling thugs to attack the centres at specific times.\n\nOne post in the group was seen by more than 125,000 people in just two hours, The Times reports.\n\nInvestigation group Red Flare said the group also features calls to murder ethnic minority Brits and government ministers.\n\nOther members of the group have shared instructions on how to make petrol bombs.\n\nOne user posted a \"arson manual\" produced by a Russian-Ukrainian neo-Nazi group called National Socialism/White Power Crew.\n\nThe group includes far-right agitators from abroad - including a Spanish fascist who pledged to \"fly England to join you guys\".\n\nSome of the asylum centres targeted have now shut or boarded up their windows.\n\nLaw Society president Nick Emmerson said: \"We have serious concerns about the safety of our members.\"\n\nIt comes after ex Met counter-terror boss Neil Basu said violent rioting is terrorism after cops were hit with petrol bombs last night.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on England and Northern Ireland's streets.\n\nFormer counter-terror chief Basu said some of the violence over the past week has \"crossed the line into terrorism\".\n\nBasu told the BBC: \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community.\"\n\nHe said the riots had been sparked by \"lies spread through social media\" - urging the government to take action.\n\nBasu also slammed Tommy Robinson for \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\nRobinson, 41, aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.\n\nThe far-right agitator has now fled to a all-inclusive resort in Cyprus - where he has posted a string of inflammatory tweets.\n\nBasu said: \"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service.\n\n\"He has spent many years skirting round various fringes of the law.\n\n\"He has been able to inflame and toxify debates and create the kind of mayhem we're seeing.\n\n\"If he is not crossing a legal threshold, then the government and society need to consider if that threshold is in the wrong place.\"\n\nIt comes after riot yobs lobbed missiles at cops, stormed a pub and chucked paint over graves in ANOTHER night of carnage.\n\nThugs hurled petrol bombs, bricks and bottles at police vans in south Belfast last night - while cops came under attack in Plymouth.\n\nIn Burnley, gravestones in a Muslim cemetery were vandalised in what the town's council leader called an \"evil act\" by \"heinous individuals\".\n\nViolent clashes broke out in dozens of UK towns and cities last week and continued over the weekend.\n\nThey have been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nSix people were arrested in Plymouth last night after cops were injured in the violence.\n\nAnd in Birmingham masked protesters interrupted a live news broadcast shouting \"F*** the EDL\" - before swarming a pub.\n\nIn south Belfast, thugs hurled stones and petrol bombs at police vans near a supermarket which had been torched at the weekend.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on England and Northern Ireland's streets.\n\nFootage shows how thugs in the Northern Irish capital hurled petrol bombs at police vans.\n\nSouth Belfast resident Mohammed Idris told the BBC he won't reopen his cafe after vile thugs torched it at the weekend.\n\nRiot cops were deployed to Sandy Row last night close to a supermarket that was set on fire.\n\nBottles, petrol bombs and planks of wood were then thrown at police vehicles during the unrest.\n\nOfficers with riot shields were seen standing firm as they lined up in a show of force despite missiles sailing through the air.\n\nYouths dressed in black were also seen throwing stones at police Land Rovers.\n\nIn Plymouth, three cops were injured after far-right supporters pelted them with stones and lumps of concrete in fresh clashes.\n\nSeveral protesters also suffered injuries, bins were set on fire and fireworks were hurled as the opposing groups collided in the seaside city.\n\nMore than 150 cops were deployed by Devon and Cornwall Police in a bid to get a grip on the situation.\n\nOfficers with riot shields stood firm and have been seen shoving back protesters from both sides who provoked them.\n\nOne male officer was pulled off the line with an apparent injury while several protesters needed treatment for head wounds.\n\nBirmingham also saw chaotic scenes as a Sky News van was attacked by knife-wielding man.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of yobs wearing balaclavas descended on a pub with a man viciously attacked.\n\nBut there were powerful scenes in Liverpool, where mosque leaders embraced far-right protesters and offered them food - reducing some to tears.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern-day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.\"\n\nMr Basu, who held the top counter-terror job between 2018 and 2021, said some of the violence during riots has \"crossed the line into terrorism\", adding: \"I hope my successors are looking at that very closely.\"\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community.\"\n\nThe Terrorism Act 2000 defines terrorism as the threat or use of serious violence against a person, serious damage to property, endangering life or creating a serious risk to the public or section of the public, \"for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause\".\n\nA number of extreme right wing groups have been designated as proscribed terrorist groups in recent years amid a rise in far-right terror, including National Action, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base.\n\nIt is not yet clear if police are treating any of the crimes linked to the riots as terror-related.\n\nHowever a CPS spokesman told The Independent prosecutors will look at \"all relevant offences\" and apply the full force of the law.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"We can't speculate about what people will be charged with but we'll look at all the relevant offences and won't hesitate to apply the full force of the law if that's where the evidence leads.\"\n\nMr Basu also called for gaps in the law around far-right influencers to be addressed to stop people with large followings like Tommy Robinson from \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\nIt comes after it emerged Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had been posting a series of inflammatory messages on X, formerly Twitter, from a \u00a3400-a night luxury resort in Cyprus.\n\n\"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service,\" Mr Basu told the BBC.\n\nMeanwhile ministers met social media giants this week amid fears that misinformation and posts to online forums are fuelling violent disorder.\n\nTechnology secretary Peter Kyle confirmed he had met representatives from TikTok, Facebook's parent company Meta, Google and X \"to make clear their responsibility to continue to work with us to stop the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

I think everyone should be appealing for calm.\n\nShe added: \"Use of language such as a civil war is in no way acceptable.\"\n\nViolent clashes broke out in dozens of UK towns and cities last week and continued over the weekend.\n\nThey have been fuelled by lies spread on Twitter following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nPosts wrongly claimed suspect Axel Rudakubana was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana, 17, was actually born in Cardiff and raised as a Christian.\n\nYesterday top cop Graham Wettone said Musk must remove fake news to stop the spread of misinformation.\n\nWettone told The Sun that companies like Musk's Twitter bear responsibility for allowing falsehoods to be posted online.\n\nWhen asked whether social media moguls such as Elon Musk need to take a look at how they are handling people like Tommy Robinson online, Mr Wettone said: \"I think so.\n\n\" I think they clearly earn a very good living out of social media platforms and online platforms and the amount of people that use them these days.\n\n\"I think that what comes with that is a responsibility to manage your platforms properly and lawfully and reasonably.\n\n\"So I think that there is a burden of responsibility on any of those social media companies to look at the the content that they are allowing to be broadcast or placed onto their sites and review it far more quickly.\n\n\"And remove anything and then block the user whenever they can.\n\n\"There's there's some awful stuff appearing on social media in the last week or so, and it stays on there for days.\n\n\"And even if you complain about something, it can take some time for it to be removed and the user to be blocked.\n\n\"But I think they need to be a lot better at managing the information.\n\n\"The misinformation around this whole incident has been appalling.\"\n\nSpeaking on LBC, she added: \"It's unconscionable. To be exercising his power in such an irresponsible way is pretty unconscionable.\"\n\nIt comes as yobs have lobbed petrol bombs, bricks and bottles at cops, stormed a pub and chucked paint over graves in ANOTHER night of carnage.\n\nThugs hurled petrol bombs at police vans in south Belfast last night - while cops came under attack in Plymouth.\n\nIn Burnley, gravestones in a Muslim cemetery were vandalised in what the town's council leader called an \"evil act\" by \"heinous individuals\".\n\nSix people were arrested in Plymouth after cops were injured in the violence.\n\nAnd in Birmingham masked protesters interrupted a live news broadcast shouting \"F*** the EDL\" - before swarming a pub.\n\nIn south Belfast, thugs hurled stones and petrol bombs at police vans near a supermarket which had been torched at the weekend.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on Britain's streets.\n\nTwenty-eight people will appear at court today following rioting in Middlesbrough on Sunday, cops said.\n\nThe individuals will appear at Teesside Magistrates' Court charged with violent disorder and other offences.\n\nEight people have also been charged in connection with disturbances that broke out during protests in Nottingham city centre.\n\nFormer counter-terror chief Neil Basu said some of the violence over the past week has \"crossed the line into terrorism\".\n\nBasu told the BBC: \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community.\"\n\nHe said the riots had been sparked by \"lies spread through social media\" - urging the government to take action.\n\nBasu also slammed Tommy Robinson for \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\nRobinson, 41, aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.\n\nThe far-right agitator has now fled to a all-inclusive resort in Cyprus - where he has posted a string of inflammatory tweets.\n\nHe said: \"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service.\n\n\"He has spent many years skirting round various fringes of the law.\n\n\"He has been able to inflame and toxify debates and create the kind of mayhem we're seeing.\n\n\"If he is not crossing a legal threshold, then the government and society need to consider if that threshold is in the wrong place.\"\n\nFootage shows how thugs in the Northern Irish capital hurled petrol bombs at police vans.\n\nSouth Belfast resident Mohammed Idris told the BBC he won't reopen his cafe after vile thugs torched it at the weekend.\n\nRiot cops were deployed to Sandy Row last night close to a supermarket that was set on fire.\n\nBottles, petrol bombs and planks of wood were then thrown at police vehicles during the unrest.\n\nOfficers with riot shields were seen standing firm as they lined up in a show of force despite missiles sailing through the air.\n\nYouths dressed in black were also seen throwing stones at police Land Rovers.\n\nIn Plymouth, three cops were injured after far-right supporters pelted them with stones and lumps of concrete in fresh clashes.\n\nSeveral protesters also suffered injuries, bins were set on fire and fireworks were hurled as the opposing groups collided in the seaside city.\n\nMore than 150 cops were deployed by Devon and Cornwall Police in a bid to get a grip on the situation.\n\nOfficers with riot shields stood firm and have been seen shoving back protesters from both sides who provoked them.\n\nOne male officer was pulled off the line with an apparent injury while several protesters needed treatment for head wounds.\n\nBirmingham also saw chaotic scenes as a Sky News van was attacked by knife-wielding man.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of yobs wearing balaclavas descended on a pub with a man viciously attacked.\n\nBut there were powerful scenes in Liverpool, where mosque leaders embraced far-right protesters and offered them food - reducing some to tears.\n\nYesterday Sir Keir chaired the first emergency Cobra meeting since the riots began.\n\nHe warned: \"If you're inciting violence, it doesn't matter whether it's online or offline\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I expect there to be arrests and prosecution.\"\n\nNearly 400 people have been arrested a week on from the fatal Southport stabbing attacks.\n\nSir Keir said a \"standing army\" of specialist officers are now on hand to deal with the disorder.\n\nMore than 500 prison places will open up next week so more rioters can be locked up.\n\nSir Keir rejected claims of two-tier policing, where right-wing protests are considered to be dealt with more harshly than left-wing ones.\n\nMet chief Sir Mark Rowley appeared to knock a reporter's microphone to the floor when quizzed about two-tier policing after the Cobra meeting.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk",

out of the way.\n\nBut she was left looking ridiculous after the cops calmly stepped away from the bin, which toppled over.\n\nToday Hodgson has pleaded guilty to violent disorder at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.\n\nHogdson denied taking part in the original march - but claimed she had been out drinking and got involved when the pub closed.\n\nThe court was told Hodgson had been \"very drunk and angry\" during the riot.\n\nRiot yob Hodgson had a \"long-running alcohol problem\", the court was told.\n\nDistrict judge Zoe Passfield said Hodgson had made the choice to get involved in the riot.\n\nPassfield added: \"This was large-scale mob violence which resulted in fear to the public and damage to local businesses.\"\n\nCops kicked down Hodgson's front door on Saturday before hauling her out in her underwear.\n\nIn footage released by Northumbria Police, officers are seen kicking in a glass door at an address in Sunderland on Saturday morning.\n\nA female officer is seen thumping on the door shouting: \"Police, open the door!\" while her colleagues scale the garden fence.\n\nThe female officer then tells another cop: \"There's someone in, can you put the door through?\"\n\nA male officer then boots the glass panel before cops swarm inside the end-terraced property.\n\nMinutes later Hodgson is led out in handcuffs while still wearing a pink and black lacy nightie\n\nTwo men who were involved in the Sunderland riot also pleaded guilty to violent disorder today.\n\nJosh Kellett, 29, from nearby Washington, admitted the offence at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.\n\nAndrew Smith, 41, from Sunderland, admitted the same offence at Newcastle Crown Court.\n\nThe two men will be sentenced along with Hodgson at Newcastle Crown Court next month.\n\nAll three offenders have been remanded in custody ahead of their sentencing.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Graeme Barr said: \"All three individuals should be ashamed of their actions and I am pleased that they have been convicted at court.\n\n\"A comprehensive investigation is well underway as we look to identify those responsible for the disorder.\"\n\nBarr added: \"We will ensure they are faced with the full force of the law.\n\n\"We will continue to pursue every investigative avenue in order to bring justice against those involved, and further activity is planned.\"\n\nIt comes as far-right thugs are plotting to attack 39 immigration centres and have shared a sick 'arson manual' in a vile online forum.\n\nA Telegram group with more than 14,000 members lists details of immigration lawyers, charities and advice centres across England.\n\nEvil far-right agitators have posted instructions in the group telling thugs to attack the centres at specific times.\n\nOne post in the group was seen by more than 125,000 people in just two hours, The Times reports.\n\nInvestigation group Red Flare said the group also features calls to murder ethnic minority Brits and government ministers.\n\nOther members of the group have shared instructions on how to make petrol bombs.\n\nOne user posted a \"arson manual\" produced by a Russian-Ukrainian neo-Nazi group called National Socialism/White Power Crew.\n\nThe group includes far-right agitators from abroad - including a Spanish fascist who pledged to \"fly England to join you guys\".\n\nSome of the asylum centres targeted have now shut or boarded up their windows.\n\nLaw Society president Nick Emmerson said: \"We have serious concerns about the safety of our members.\"\n\nIt comes after ex Met counter-terror boss Neil Basu said violent rioting is terrorism after cops were hit with petrol bombs last night.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on England and Northern Ireland's streets.\n\nFormer counter-terror chief Basu said some of the violence over the past week has \"crossed the line into terrorism\".\n\nBasu told the BBC: \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community.\"\n\nHe said the riots had been sparked by \"lies spread through social media\" - urging the government to take action.\n\nBasu also slammed Tommy Robinson for \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\nRobinson, 41, aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.\n\nThe far-right agitator has now fled to a all-inclusive resort in Cyprus - where he has posted a string of inflammatory tweets.\n\nBasu said: \"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service.\n\n\"He has spent many years skirting round various fringes of the law.\n\n\"He has been able to inflame and toxify debates and create the kind of mayhem we're seeing.\n\n\"If he is not crossing a legal threshold, then the government and society need to consider if that threshold is in the wrong place.\"\n\nIt comes after riot yobs lobbed missiles at cops, stormed a pub and chucked paint over graves in ANOTHER night of carnage.\n\nThugs hurled petrol bombs, bricks and bottles at police vans in south Belfast last night - while cops came under attack in Plymouth.\n\nIn Burnley, gravestones in a Muslim cemetery were vandalised in what the town's council leader called an \"evil act\" by \"heinous individuals\".\n\nViolent clashes broke out in dozens of UK towns and cities last week and continued over the weekend.\n\nThey have been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nPosts wrongly claimed suspect Axel Rudakubana was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana, 17, was actually born in Cardiff and raised as a Christian.\n\nSix people were arrested in Plymouth last night after cops were injured in the violence.\n\nAnd in Birmingham masked protesters interrupted a live news broadcast shouting \"F*** the EDL\" - before swarming a pub.\n\nIn south Belfast, thugs hurled stones and petrol bombs at police vans near a supermarket which had been torched at the weekend.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on England and Northern Ireland's streets.\n\nFootage shows how thugs in the Northern Irish capital hurled petrol bombs at police vans.\n\nSouth Belfast resident Mohammed Idris told the BBC he won't reopen his cafe after vile thugs torched it at the weekend.\n\nRiot cops were deployed to Sandy Row last night close to a supermarket that was set on fire.\n\nBottles, petrol bombs and planks of

It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern-day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.\"\n\nMr Basu, who held the top counter-terror job between 2018 and 2021, said some of the violence during riots has \"crossed the line into terrorism\", adding: \"I hope my successors are looking at that very closely.\"\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community.\"\n\nThe Terrorism Act 2000 defines terrorism as the threat or use of serious violence against a person, serious damage to property, endangering life or creating a serious risk to the public or section of the public, \"for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause\".\n\nA number of extreme right wing groups have been designated as proscribed terrorist groups in recent years amid a rise in far-right terror, including National Action, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base.\n\nIt is not yet clear if police are treating any of the crimes linked to the riots as terror-related.\n\nHowever a CPS spokesman told The Independent prosecutors will look at \"all relevant offences\" and apply the full force of the law.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"We can't speculate about what people will be charged with but we'll look at all the relevant offences and won't hesitate to apply the full force of the law if that's where the evidence leads.\"\n\nMr Basu also called for gaps in the law around far-right influencers to be addressed to stop people with large followings like Tommy Robinson from \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\nIt comes after it emerged Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had been posting a series of inflammatory messages on X, formerly Twitter, from a \u00a3400-a night luxury resort in Cyprus.\n\n\"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service,\" Mr Basu told the BBC.\n\nMeanwhile ministers met social media giants this week amid fears that misinformation and posts to online forums are fuelling violent disorder.\n\nTechnology secretary Peter Kyle confirmed he had met representatives from TikTok, Facebook's parent company Meta, Google and X \"to make clear their responsibility to continue to work with us to stop the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

Far-right Groups Distribute Arson Manual After Another Night of Violence in the UK. - Internewscast Journal", "body": "The former head of counter-terror policing today likened the worst of the riots to 'terrorism' and called a bid to torch a migrant hotel 'an attempt at a modern day lynching'.\n\nNeil Basu said thugs who tried to burn down a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham while people were inside should be facing life in jail 'not a five-year sentence for violent disorder'.\n\nHe said the shocking incident on Sunday was an example of a serious act of violence that was 'designed to cause terror' and 'people should look very carefully' at the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nSix people will today appear in court today charged over the Rotherham hotel attack, as ministers promised hundreds of extra prison spaces and said a 'standing army' of 6,000 specialist police officers were at the ready.\n\nIt emerged today that Telegram users in far-right groups have been sharing instructions on how to make petrol bombs and an 'arson manual' produced by National Socialism/White Power Crew - a Russian neo-Nazi group.\n\nMilitants have also been plotting attacks on immigration lawyers, with a list of solicitors' firms and advice agencies shared on a Telegram group with more than 14,000 alongside a call to attack them at a specific time tomorrow night.\n\nMr Basu, who served as Britain's leading counter-terror officer from 2018 to 2021, called for long sentences for those guilty of the most serious offences.\n\n'Trying to set ablaze a building with people inside, whom you have made clear you detest, is an act of violence against people and property with a racial cause designed to intimidate a section of the public - be it Muslims or asylum seekers,' he told the Guardian.\n\n'Not only does it fit the definition of terrorism, it is terrorism. It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.'\n\nMr Basu also called for those organising the violence to face prosecution.\n\n'We overestimate the intelligence of thugs. They don't think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late, but jail a few and the others will run back under cover. They are bullies and cowards,' he said.\n\nMr Basu has in the past been criticised for controversial interventions, including urging the Metropolitan Police to accept it is still institutionally racist and saying positive discrimination may be necessary.\n\nHis call to treat rioters as terrorists contrasted with those by Jonathan Hall KC, the Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, who called for caution.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think that you need to be cautious about applying counter-terrorism in effectively a live incident, it could be escalatory.\n\n'You'll end up with finger pointing one group will start saying well if you're calling these people terrorists, why don't you call these people terrorists.'\n\nAs MailOnline revealed, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nIn his own interview with the BBC, Mr Basu said the orgy of violence had been triggered by 'lies spread through social media' and 'we need to do something about that'.\n\nHe said there were gaps in the laws relating to hateful extremism that needed to be filled, particularly to stop Robinson 'glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean'.\n\nMinisters have been locked with a war of words with X owner Elon Musk over his inflammatory comments about the riots.\n\nDowning Street yesterday rebuked the billionaire for using his platform to claim that 'civil war is inevitable' below a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police, with Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman saying there was 'no justification' for the comments.\n\nA few hours later, Mr Musk - the richest man in the world worth over $200billion - criticised Sir Keir directly by responding to a video posted by the PM stressing attacks on mosques and Muslims would not be tolerated.\n\nMr Musk, who has 193million global followers, replied asking Sir Keir: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?'\n\nJustice minister Heidi Alexander has since weighed into the row, calling the mogul's comments 'deplorable'.\n\nTheir clashes came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent protests by the far-right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago.\n\nLast night hundreds of far-right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured.\n\nAnd in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after Muslim people gathered amid claims far-right groups would target the Small Health area.\n\nA group were later filmed attacking a pub, the Clumsy Swan.\n\nA GP surgery in Birmingham also closed as hundreds of Muslim people turned out to counter a rumoured far-right gathering.\n\nPolice later said they were probing assault, criminal damage and attacks on cars - but that the far-right mob never materialised.\n\nAnti-Muslim hate crime charity Tell Mama has urged Muslims to stay at home and 'not be baited by far-right thugs'.\n\nPolice were pelted with bricks last night as violence erupted near a mosque in Darlington, County Durham.\n\nTrouble erupted at 9pm when two groups gathered in North Lodge Park in the town, close to the Jamia Mosque & Islamic Society Of Darlington.\n\nBoth Asian and white youths were involved in the violent disorder which saw Durham Constabulary backed up by colleagues from the neighbouring Northumbria and Cleveland forces. One youth was arrested.\n\nDarlington's newly elected Labour MP Lola McEvoy has condemned the violence, saying Darlington has long embraced its Muslim community and added: 'Everyone who lives here must be allowed to live their lives happily and in peace.'\n\nDisorder also continued last night in areas of Belfast.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern has said its officers came under sustained attack from multiple petrol bombs, heavy masonry and bricks in the south of the city.\n\nToday Ms Alexander vowed there were sufficient prison spaces available to accommodate riot thugs.\n\n'We will make sure that anyone who is given a custodial sentence as a result of the riots and disorder, there will be a prison place waiting for them,' she warned on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nThe minister said some 567 additional spaces would soon come into use.\n\nExtra cells at HMP Stocken, Rutland, will be in use from 'next week', she said, with plans also in place to use space at Cookham Wood Young Offender Institution in Kent for adult prisoners.\n\nShe also revealed more detail about the planned 'standing army' of police officers Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nMs Alexander told Times Radio: 'These are police officers who have had specialist training in dealing with public order offences.\n\n'We had 4,000 available at the weekend. There will be another 2,000 available this week. It also means that police officers are able to be deployed in parts of the country where they are needed most.'\n\nElsewhere, she said courts 'could possibly' begin sitting 'through the evening, the night, at weekends' in order to swiftly prosecute rioters.\n\nThe additional courts protocol, which was created in the aftermath of the 2011 riots, could be invoked in areas where police and prosecuting chiefs feel it is needed, the minister also told LBC.\n\nThe courts are now 'willing to consider any of those requests', according to Ms Alexander.\n\nThe Government's toughening stance comes as South Yorkshire police said people have been charged with offences following rioting outside a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday.\n\nLee Crisp, 42, of Mount Road, Grimethorpe; Christopher Rodgers, 38, of Millmoor Road, Barnsley; and Liam Grey, 20, of Randerson Drive, Mexborough; have been charged with violent disorder.\n\nTwo boys aged 16 and 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have also been charged with violent disorder.\n\nJoshua Simpson, 26, of Sherbrook Street, Lincoln, has been charged with violent disorder and assault of an emergency worker.\n\nToday, former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq said relatives in Rotherham have felt unable to go out and live normally amid the 'frightening' violence.\n\nHe told Sky News: 'We're not so far away either, it's really worrying times for all of us concerned.'\n\nMeanwhile, Avon and Somerset Police said a third man has been charged in connection with violent disorder in Bristol city centre on Saturday\n\nAshley Harris, 36, of Chipperfield Drive, Kingswood, has been charged with violent disorder and is due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court later on Tuesday.\n\nTwo other men, aged 45 and 39, were charged with Section 4 public order offences on Sunday and are due in court in September.\n\nIn Plymouth on Monday night, 'several officers' suffered minor injuries and two members of the public were taken to hospital, Devon and Cornwall Police said.\n\nIn Southport, hundreds of people attended a peaceful vigil yesterday evening a week on from the murders of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar.\n\nChildren blew bubbles and others left flowers and heart-shaped balloons on Monday evening in remembrance of the victims of the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nMerseyside Police have since said one child caught up in the incident remained in hospital but all other patients had been discharged.\n\nIncorrect rumours, that the suspect in the stabbings was an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK on a small boat spread via social media, appear to have fuelled the unrest.\n\nToday, the Archbishop of Canterbury said people involved in violent riots 'defile the flag that they wrap themselves in'.\n\nThe Church of England leader spoke of 'manipulation' through social media and 'by people abroad', which he said must be 'strongly resisted'.",

'violence'", "body": "Watch footage of Hodgson's idiotic riot spree in the player above\n\nAN IDIOT yob has been found guilty over \"violent\" chaos after shoving a bin at cops - who calmly stepped out of the way.\n\nLeanne Hodgson, 43, was a key member of a far-right riot which broke out in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nFootage showed Hodgson pushing a large bin towards a line of riot cops during the carnage.\n\nA large crowd cheered as Hodgson tried to shove the bin into the police line.\n\nBut she was left looking ridiculous after the cops calmly stepped away from the bin, which toppled over.\n\nToday Hodgson has pleaded guilty to violent disorder at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.\n\nHogdson denied taking part in the original march - but claimed she had been out drinking and got involved when the pub closed.\n\nThe court was told Hodgson had been \"very drunk and angry\" during the riot.\n\nRiot yob Hodgson had a \"long-running alcohol problem\", the court was told.\n\nDistrict judge Zoe Passfield said Hodgson had made the choice to get involved in the riot.\n\nPassfield added: \"This was large-scale mob violence which resulted in fear to the public and damage to local businesses.\"\n\nCops kicked down Hodgson's front door on Saturday before hauling her out in her underwear.\n\nIn footage released by Northumbria Police, officers are seen kicking in a glass door at an address in Sunderland on Saturday morning.\n\nA female officer is seen thumping on the door shouting: \"Police, open the door!\" while her colleagues scale the garden fence.\n\nThe female officer then tells another cop: \"There's someone in, can you put the door through?\"\n\nA male officer then boots the glass panel before cops swarm inside the end-terraced property.\n\nMinutes later Hodgson is led out in handcuffs while still wearing a pink and black lacy nightie\n\nTwo men who were involved in the Sunderland riot also pleaded guilty to violent disorder today.\n\nJosh Kellett, 29, from nearby Washington, admitted the offence at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.\n\nAndrew Smith, 41, from Sunderland, admitted the same offence at Newcastle Crown Court.\n\nThe two men will be sentenced along with Hodgson at Newcastle Crown Court next month.\n\nAll three offenders have been remanded in custody ahead of their sentencing.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Graeme Barr said: \"All three individuals should be ashamed of their actions and I am pleased that they have been convicted at court.\n\n\"A comprehensive investigation is well underway as we look to identify those responsible for the disorder.\"\n\nBarr added: \"We will ensure they are faced with the full force of the law.\n\n\"We will continue to pursue every investigative avenue in order to bring justice against those involved, and further activity is planned.\"\n\nIt comes as far-right thugs are plotting to attack 39 immigration centres and have shared a sick 'arson manual' in a vile online forum.\n\nA Telegram group with more than 14,000 members lists details of immigration lawyers, charities and advice centres across England.\n\nEvil far-right agitators have posted instructions in the group telling thugs to attack the centres at specific times.\n\nOne post in the group was seen by more than 125,000 people in just two hours, The Times reports.\n\nInvestigation group Red Flare said the group also features calls to murder ethnic minority Brits and government ministers.\n\nOther members of the group have shared instructions on how to make petrol bombs.\n\nOne user posted a \"arson manual\" produced by a Russian-Ukrainian neo-Nazi group called National Socialism/White Power Crew.\n\nThe group includes far-right agitators from abroad - including a Spanish fascist who pledged to \"fly England to join you guys\".\n\nSome of the asylum centres targeted have now shut or boarded up their windows.\n\nLaw Society president Nick Emmerson said: \"We have serious concerns about the safety of our members.\"\n\nIt comes after ex Met counter-terror boss Neil Basu said violent rioting is terrorism after cops were hit with petrol bombs last night.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on England and Northern Ireland's streets.\n\nFormer counter-terror chief Basu said some of the violence over the past week has \"crossed the line into terrorism\".\n\nBasu told the BBC: \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community.\"\n\nHe said the riots had been sparked by \"lies spread through social media\" - urging the government to take action.\n\nBasu also slammed Tommy Robinson for \"glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean\".\n\nRobinson, 41, aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.\n\nThe far-right agitator has now fled to a all-inclusive resort in Cyprus - where he has posted a string of inflammatory tweets.\n\nBasu said: \"Yaxley-Lennon knows well he's in the full glare of policing, counter-terrorism policing, and the security service.\n\n\"He has spent many years skirting round various fringes of the law.\n\n\"He has been able to inflame and toxify debates and create the kind of mayhem we're seeing.\n\n\"If he is not crossing a legal threshold, then the government and society need to consider if that threshold is in the wrong place.\"\n\nIt comes after riot yobs lobbed missiles at cops, stormed a pub and chucked paint over graves in ANOTHER night of carnage.\n\nThugs hurled petrol bombs, bricks and bottles at police vans in south Belfast last night - while cops came under attack in Plymouth.\n\nIn Burnley, gravestones in a Muslim cemetery were vandalised in what the town's council leader called an \"evil act\" by \"heinous individuals\".\n\nViolent clashes broke out in dozens of UK towns and cities last week and continued over the weekend.\n\nThey have been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nPosts wrongly claimed suspect Axel Rudakubana was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana, 17, was actually born in Cardiff and raised as a Christian.\n\nSix people were arrested in Plymouth last night after cops were injured in the violence.\n\nAnd in Birmingham masked protesters interrupted a live news broadcast shouting \"F*** the EDL\" - before swarming a pub.\n\nIn south Belfast, thugs hurled stones and petrol bombs at police vans near a supermarket which had been torched at the weekend.\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested over the week of carnage on England and Northern Ireland's streets.\n\nFootage shows how thugs in the Northern Irish capital hurled petrol bombs at police vans.\n\nSouth Belfast resident Mohammed Idris told the BBC he won't reopen his cafe after vile thugs torched it at the weekend.\n\nRiot cops were deployed to Sandy Row last night close to a supermarket that was set on fire.\n\nBottles, petrol bombs and planks of wood were then thrown at police vehicles during the unrest.\n\nOfficers with riot shields were seen standing firm as they lined up in a show of force despite missiles sailing through the air.\n\nYouths dressed in black were also seen throwing stones at police Land Rovers.\n\nIn Plymouth, three cops were injured after far-right supporters pelted them with stones and lumps of concrete in fresh clashes.\n\nSeveral protesters also suffered injuries, bins were set on fire and fireworks were hurled as the opposing groups collided in the seaside city.\n\nMore than 150 cops were deployed by Devon and Cornwall Police in a bid to get a grip on the situation.\n\nOfficers with riot shields stood firm and have been seen shoving back protesters from both sides who provoked them.\n\nOne male officer was pulled off the line with an apparent injury while several protesters needed treatment for head wounds.\n\nBirmingham also saw chaotic scenes as a Sky News van was attacked by knife-wielding man.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of yobs wearing balaclavas descended on a pub with a man viciously attacked.\n\nBut there were powerful scenes in Liverpool, where mosque leaders embraced far-right protesters and offered them food - reducing some to tears.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie",

It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.'\n\nMr Basu also called for those organising the violence to face prosecution.\n\n'We overestimate the intelligence of thugs. They don't think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late, but jail a few and the others will run back under cover. They are bullies and cowards,' he said.\n\nMr Basu has in the past been criticised for controversial interventions, including urging the Metropolitan Police to accept it is still institutionally racist and saying positive discrimination may be necessary.\n\nHis call to treat rioters as terrorists contrasted with those by Jonathan Hall KC, the Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, who called for caution.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think that you need to be cautious about applying counter-terrorism in effectively a live incident, it could be escalatory.\n\n'You'll end up with finger pointing one group will start saying well if you're calling these people terrorists, why don't you call these people terrorists.'\n\nPLYMOUTH: Police were out in force in Plymouth last night, where a rally turned ugly\n\nPLYMOUTH: Police detain a man following violent clashes in the south coast city\n\nAs MailOnline revealed, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nIn his own interview with the BBC, Mr Basu said the orgy of violence had been triggered by 'lies spread through social media' and 'we need to do something about that'.\n\nHe said there were gaps in the laws relating to hateful extremism that needed to be filled, particularly to stop Robinson 'glorifying and creating violence from his sunbed in the Mediterranean'.\n\nRead More Chaos engulfs Britain AGAIN: Violent disorder in Plymouth as hundreds of Muslims march in Birmingham\n\nMinisters have been locked with a war of words with X owner Elon Musk over his inflammatory comments about the riots.\n\nDowning Street yesterday rebuked the billionaire for using his platform to claim that 'civil war is inevitable' below a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police, with Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman saying there was 'no justification' for the comments.\n\nA few hours later, Mr Musk - the richest man in the world worth over $200billion - criticised Sir Keir directly by responding to a video posted by the PM stressing attacks on mosques and Muslims would not be tolerated.\n\nMr Musk, who has 193million global followers, replied asking Sir Keir: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?'\n\nJustice minister Heidi Alexander has since weighed into the row, calling the mogul's comments 'deplorable'.\n\nTheir clashes came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent protests by the far-right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago.\n\nBIRMINGHAM: Young men, some in masks, gathered yesterday outside a McDonald's in Bordesley Green amid rumours of a far-right gathering\n\nBIRMINGHAM: Men wearing masks and waving Palestine flags gather in Birmingham yesterday\n\nLast night hundreds of far-right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured.\n\nAnd in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after Muslim people gathered amid claims far-right groups would target the Small Health area.\n\nA group were later filmed attacking a pub, the Clumsy Swan, with Muslim elders later visiting to apologise.\n\nRead More Hate crime charity urges Muslims 'not to take the bait of far right thugs' and instead stay at home\n\nA GP surgery in Birmingham also closed as hundreds of Muslim people turned out to counter a rumoured far-right gathering.\n\nPolice later said they were probing assault, criminal damage and attacks on cars - but that the far-right mob never materialised.\n\nAnti-Muslim hate crime charity Tell Mama has urged Muslims to stay at home and 'not be baited by far-right thugs'.\n\nPolice were pelted with bricks last night as violence erupted near a mosque in Darlington, County Durham.\n\nTrouble erupted at 9pm when two groups gathered in North Lodge Park in the town, close to the Jamia Mosque & Islamic Society Of Darlington.\n\nBoth Asian and white youths were involved in the violent disorder which saw Durham Constabulary backed up by colleagues from the neighbouring Northumbria and Cleveland forces. One youth was arrested.\n\nDarlington's newly elected Labour MP Lola McEvoy has condemned the violence, saying Darlington has long embraced its Muslim community and added: 'Everyone who lives here must be allowed to live their lives happily and in peace.'\n\nDisorder also continued last night in areas of Belfast.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern has said its officers came under sustained attack from multiple petrol bombs, heavy masonry and bricks in the south of the city.\n\nToday Ms Alexander vowed there were sufficient prison spaces available to accommodate riot thugs.\n\n'We will make sure that anyone who is given a custodial sentence as a result of the riots and disorder, there will be a prison place waiting for them,' she warned on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nBIRMINGHAM: Pubgoers screamed as protesters faced off against a man outside - before he was kicked to the floor\n\nBELFAST: Disorder also continued last night Northern Ireland, with this video showing a petrol bomb being hurled at police\n\nHUDDERSFIELD: Shops in Huddersfield closed early as claims of a planned protest in the town spread on social media\n\nSOUTHPORT: In contrast to riots across the country, locals turned out in Southport to lay flowers and teddies and blow bubbles\n\nThe minister said some 567 additional spaces would soon come into use.\n\nExtra cells at HMP Stocken, Rutland, will be in use from 'next week', she said, with plans also in place to use space at Cookham Wood Young Offender Institution in Kent for adult prisoners.\n\nShe also revealed more detail about the planned 'standing army' of police officers Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nMs Alexander told Times Radio: 'These are police officers who have had specialist training in dealing with public order offences.\n\nRead More Now Reclaim's Laurence Fox is seen flying to IRELAND... before declaring 'war' on 'traitor' Starmer\n\n'We had 4,000 available at the weekend. There will be another 2,000 available this week. It also means that police officers are able to be deployed in parts of the country where they are needed most.'\n\nElsewhere, she said courts 'could possibly' begin sitting 'through the evening, the night, at weekends' in order to swiftly prosecute rioters.\n\nThe additional courts protocol, which was created in the aftermath of the 2011 riots, could be invoked in areas where police and prosecuting chiefs feel it is needed, the minister also told LBC.\n\nThe courts are now 'willing to consider any of those requests', according to Ms Alexander.\n\nThe Government's toughening stance comes as South Yorkshire police said people have been charged with offences following rioting outside a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday.\n\nLee Crisp, 42, of Mount Road, Grimethorpe; Christopher Rodgers, 38, of Millmoor Road, Barnsley; and Liam Grey, 20, of Randerson Drive, Mexborough; have been charged with violent disorder.\n\nTwo boys aged 16 and 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have also been charged with violent disorder.\n\nDowning Street last night rebuked Elon Musk, the owner of X, for using his platform to claim that 'civil war is inevitable'\n\nMusk had earlier replied to a tweet by right-wing commentator Ashley St Clair, who said far-right rioting was down to 'the effects of mass migration', by suggesting 'civil war is inevitable'\n\nSir Keir said: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.' In response, Mr Musk wrote: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?'\n\nMr Musk later hit out at British police last night as he responded to an offensive cartoon\n\nJoshua Simpson, 26, of Sherbrook Street, Lincoln, has been charged with violent disorder and assault of an emergency worker.\n\nToday, former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq said relatives in Rotherham have felt unable to go out and live normally amid the 'frightening' violence.\n\nRead More Looters risk years behind bars to raid shops amid UK riots\n\nHe told Sky News: 'We're not so far away either, it's really worrying times for all of us concerned.'\n\nMeanwhile, Avon and Somerset Police said a third man has been charged in connection with violent disorder in Bristol city centre on Saturday\n\nAshley Harris, 36, of Chipperfield Drive, Kingswood, has been charged with violent disorder and is due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court later on Tuesday.\n\nTwo other men, aged 45 and 39, were charged with Section 4 public order offences on Sunday and are due in court in September.\n\nIn Plymouth on Monday night, 'several officers' suffered minor injuries and two members of the public were taken to hospital, Devon and Cornwall Police said.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, pictured at Downing Street today, has criticised Elon Musk\n\nIn Southport, hundreds of people attended a peaceful vigil yesterday evening a week on from the murders of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar.\n\nChildren blew bubbles and others left flowers and heart-shaped balloons on Monday evening in remembrance of the victims of the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nMerseyside Police have since said one child caught up in the incident remained in hospital but all other patients had been discharged.\n\nIncorrect rumours, that the suspect in the stabbings was an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK on a small boat spread via social media, appear to have fuelled the unrest.\n\nToday, the Archbishop of Canterbury said people involved in violent riots 'defile the flag that they wrap themselves in'.\n\nThe Church of England leader spoke of 'manipulation' through social media and 'by people abroad', which he said must be 'strongly resisted'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

They are also bullies and cowards.\"\n\nHe previously said \"extremist organisers\" needed to be looked at \"with the full force of national security law\" and that \"charging (them) with very serious offences\" would help end the riots.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Basu told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme that he looked closely at \"right wing terrorism\" when he was the head of counter terrorism.\n\n\"We had an issue when I was head of counter terrorism with the previous administration because they didn't like the term 'right wing terrorism' and when we suggested far-Right terrorism - because far-Right political ideology was behind some of the terrorist acts - they didn't like that either because they argued that far-Right is a legitimate political position...,\" he said.\n\n\"What isn't acceptable is extreme right wing, which is where we settled on the definition of extreme right wing terrorism, and that tends to be the people we look at as neo Nazis or white supremacists. Taking an anti-immigration, Islamophobic, anti-Muslim-hatred attitude to its extreme is wanting to kill people who are different from you.\n\n\"Now that is a rubicon and we don't know whether that has been crossed - at the moment it looks like violence, riots, disorder and affray - but the people who are committing that on the streets are people who are being used by people who are manipulating them into doing that.\n\n\"Now their behaviour is something I would want to be looking at very closely as the head of counter terrorism as to whether they have crossed that rubicon and whether or not they are now extremist organisers and people who need to be looked at with the full force of national security law.\"\n\nMr Basu said some of the rioting reminded him of the National Front in the 1970s and praised the Prime Minister for \"calling it out for what it is, which is extremism\".\n\n\"I think the hard action they are talking about, multiple arrests, certain charging with very serious offences, all of that needs to happen and it needs to happen rapidly and that is what will bring it to a conclusion,\" he said.\n\nThe disorder in the past week follows a knife attack on children attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Three little girls died in the attack, with 17-year-old Axel Muganwa Rudakubana charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder.\n\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister called for perpetrators to be named and shamed, as he announced a \"standing army\" of specialist police officers is being assembled to crack down on rioting.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "albert_tait@aol.co.uk", "name": "Albert Tait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Basu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Basu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong national security law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Definition of terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The World at One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puppet state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lynching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Front (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Activism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Conferences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2Ie1QtN3OUFdnVA5TRtQ2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/7d37de09db9c6cd08370862db456b629", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794048", "eventUri": "eng-9794048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

What does this mean for social media companies? And where did this \"two-tier policing\" claim come from?\n\nThe far-right violence which has swept across the UK in the last week is raising a series of difficult questions for the government - and Brits in general.\n\nThe death of three girls in the Southport stabbings triggered a slew of social media misinformation to appear in extremists circles about the suspect's identity.\n\nThis led to a series of ill-informed riots against migrants and particularly the Muslim community, who are \"terrified\".\n\nWith more violence expected on Wednesday, the topic has become a major source of controversy and concern.\n\nHere's a look at the most pressing questions this sudden unrest has raised.\n\nAs the violence escalates, there have been calls for officials to call the unrest \"domestic terrorism\".\n\nThe Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) describes terrorism as the use or threat of one or more of these actions below:\n\nIf these are \"terrorist\" acts, they are intended to influence the government or an international governmental organisation, or intimidate the public.\n\nIt is also meant to advance a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.\n\nThe CPS notes there has been a rise in extreme right-wing terrorism recently in the UK, as individuals promote \"messages of hate-filled prejudice\" to encourage \"radicalisation\".\n\nEx-police chief Neil Basu, the former head of UK counter-terrorism, said on Monday that the riots should be described as terrorism.\n\n\"Trying to set ablaze a building with people inside, whom you have made clear you detest, is an act of violence against people and property with a racial cause designed to intimidate a section of the public - be it Muslims or asylum seekers,\" he said.\n\n\"Not only does it fit the definition of terrorism, it is terrorism. It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern-day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.\"\n\nBut a spokesperson for counter-terrorism policing told The Guardian these acts of violence do not necessarily meet the definition, even if fuelled by hate.\n\nSo far, the government has only called it \"far-right hatred\" and condemned the acts of \"thuggery\".\n\nDeputy PM Angela Rayner suggested that far-right group the English Defence League, believed to have played a part in some riots, could be proscribed as a terrorist organisation.\n\nHowever, that group has mostly disintegrated over the years, so it's not clear how much of an impact that would have.\n\nMPs on the left, including independent Zarah Sultana, have urged the government to make Islamophobia a crime in the wake of the riots, where mosques have been targeted.\n\nSultana argued with GMB hosts on Monday that there is a \"direct correlation\" between the language politicians have used in recent years and the language now being used by the mobs.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has also called for the British Muslims' definition of Islamophobia to be adopted into law.\n\nMPs on the right have argued against such a move. Sir Christopher Chope, a Tory MP, said: \"I think to subdivide different types of rioting, depending upon the aim of the rioters, is ridiculous. We should treat all rioters equally.\"\n\nDeputy leader of Reform UK Richard Tice said making Islamophobia a crime would mean making \"criticism or abuse or concern of Christianity a crime\" too.\n\nComplaints the police treat white people more severely than Black and Brown people - even when they are all breaking the law - have soared recently.\n\nThe claim stems from those on the right, such as Reform Party leader Nigel Farage, and has been around for some years.\n\nNow far-right extremists are being arrested en masse for violence, the allegation has returned.\n\nIt is reportedly part of a wider conspiracy to cast white people as the oppressed.\n\nThe government and the Met Police chief have repeatedly shut down such accusations, with PM Keir Starmer calling it a \"non-issue\".\n\nDevon Police and Crime Commissioner, Alison Hernandez, also said the phrase was being used to \"incite hate\" online and it would not be tolerated.\n\nWhile the government and police chiefs have promised rioters will be met with the \"full force of the law\", there are concerns the UK actually does not have enough officers to deal with the crisis.\n\nThe far-right are also particularly difficult to manage, according to officials.\n\nDevon Police and Crime Commissioner, Alison Hernandez, said that there was a lack of transparency between the organisers and the police, as it's not clear who is the leader and the group does not liaise with the local officers.\n\n\"That's what all peaceful protesters do, and we would really respect if they followed the rules around that,\" Hernandez said while speaking to the BBC.\n\nStarmer announced a \"standing army\" of 6,000 specialist police officers will be put together to address the riots on Monday, but there are currently no plans to get the Army involved.\n\nNearly 400 people have already been arrested since the unrest began last week.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police also promised on Monday that the force was \"fully resourced at this time with a strong police presence\".\n\nThe UK justice system was already facing a serious strain when Labour first got into office, with prisons weeks away from max capacity.\n\nThe government decided to release some offenders slightly early to ease the pressure.\n\nBut there's already a new risk cells could be filled up again with far-right extremists.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice also said it will create 500 more places in prisons over the next month.\n\nFormer head of UK counter-terrorism, Neil Basu, downplayed that worry, saying: \"We overestimate the intelligence of thugs. They don't think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late, but jail a few and the others will run back under cover. They are bullies and cowards.\"\n\nThe riots were galvanised by social media misinformation about the suspect at the centre of the Southport stabbings.\n\nFar-right accounts claimed the suspect was an asylum seeker, and on MI6's watch list. Neither allegation was true.\n\nStarmer vowed to crack down on social media companies for not policing their platforms, saying it was a crime to let such hatred grow.\n\n\"It's happening on your premises, and the law must be upheld everywhere,\" he said.\n\nX boss Elon Musk then waded into the conversation around the riots, saying \"civil war is inevitable\" in the UK now, which sparked the No.10 spokesperson to say there is \"no justification\" for such comments.\n\nThe government has pledged to \"stop the spread of hateful information\" online.\n\nTechnology secretary Peter Kyle met with TikTok, Meta, Google and X this week, and was looking at if hostile state actors accelerated any fake posts.\n\nIn the meantime, charities like Tell MAMA are calling for fines for social media companies.\n\nDuties on social media firms are expected under the Online Safety Act but that won't be introduced for several months.\n\nThe PM has so far rejected calls for parliament to end its summer recess so that MPs can debate what should happen next with this wave of violence.\n\nStarmer said: \"My focus is on making sure that we stop this disorder, that the criminal sanctions are swift and be seen to be followed.\"\n\nBut that's not the case across the whole country - the Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled to Stormont early, after a wave of far-right violence in Belfast.\n\nMPs and 60 anti-racist and migrants' right organisations called for parliament to be recalled as well, \"to ensure that all people and communities of colour are protected.\"\n\nThere's been plenty of finger-pointing over where this surge in far-right sentiment has come from.\n\nMany are blaming the Conservatives for their anti-migrant rhetoric which they have been ramping up in recent years - former home secretary Suella Braverman once called the arrival of refugees on British shores an \"invasion\".\n\nOthers blame Starmer after he \"dithered and delayed\" in calling an emergency COBRA meeting, according to Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick.\n\nFormer Tory chair and peer Sayeeda Warsi said: \"When the government responds to this, they absolutely have to be brave enough to say, 'where has this really come from? Who has been feeding this beast? Who has created the racist rhetoric? Who is poisoning the public discourse?'\"\n\nReassuringly, these thuggish beliefs are not too pervasive within British society.\n\nA YouGov poll shows just 7% of Brits support the riots, 8% have sympathy for their views and only 12% think they're justified.\n\nMore riots are expected.\n\nAn organisation which monitoring of anti-Muslim attacks, Tell MAMA, even said it had alerted counter-terrorism police to some of the next wave of riots expected.\n\nThe \"far-right threats on Telegram that seek to target immigration solicitors and refugee services\" in more than 30 locations across the UK on Wednesday.\n\nIn the meantime, it remains unclear if Keir Starmer will go on his pre-planned holiday later this week.", "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

comments from Mr Basu who told the Guardian: \"Trying to set ablaze a building with people inside, whom you have made clear you detest, is an act of violence against people and property with a racial cause designed to intimidate a section of the public - be it Muslims or asylum seekers.\n\n\"Not only does it fit the definition of terrorism, it is terrorism.\n\n\"It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern-day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.\"\n\nRioters have been targeting hotels housing asylum seekers, mosques and areas with a majority Muslim presence.\n\nThe riots began in Southport last Tuesday in the wake of the fatal stabbings of three girls in the Merseyside town, and have spread to towns and

It's nothing short of an attempt at a modern-day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.\"\n\nBut a spokesperson for counter-terrorism policing told The Guardian these acts of violence do not necessarily meet the definition, even if fuelled by hate.\n\nSo far, the government has only called it \"far-right hatred\" and condemned the acts of \"thuggery\".\n\nDeputy PM Angela Rayner suggested that far-right group the English Defence League, believed to have played a part in some riots, could be proscribed as a terrorist organisation.\n\nHowever, that group has mostly disintegrated over the years, so it's not clear how much of an impact that would have.\n\nMPs on the left, including independent Zarah Sultana, have urged the government to make Islamophobia a crime in the wake of the riots, where mosques have been targeted.\n\nSultana argued with GMB hosts on Monday that there is a \"direct correlation\" between the language politicians have used in recent years and the language now being used by the mobs.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has also called for the British Muslims' definition of Islamophobia to be adopted into law.\n\nMPs on the right have argued against such a move. Sir Christopher Chope, a Tory MP, said: \"I think to subdivide different types of rioting, depending upon the aim of the rioters, is ridiculous. We should treat all rioters equally.\"\n\nDeputy leader of Reform UK Richard Tice said making Islamophobia a crime would mean making \"criticism or abuse or concern of Christianity a crime\" too.\n\nComplaints the police treat white people more severely than Black and Brown people - even when they are all breaking the law - have soared recently.\n\nThe claim stems from those on the right, such as Reform Party leader Nigel Farage, and has been around for some years.\n\nNow far-right extremists are being arrested en masse for violence, the allegation has returned.\n\nIt is reportedly part of a wider conspiracy to cast white people as the oppressed.\n\nThe government and the Met Police chief have repeatedly shut down such accusations, with PM Keir Starmer calling it a \"non-issue\".\n\nDevon Police and Crime Commissioner, Alison Hernandez, also said the phrase was being used to \"incite hate\" online and it would not be tolerated.\n\nWhile the government and police chiefs have promised rioters will be met with the \"full force of the law\", there are concerns the UK actually does not have enough officers to deal with the crisis.\n\nThe far-right are also particularly difficult to manage, according to officials.\n\nDevon Police and Crime Commissioner, Alison Hernandez, said that there was a lack of transparency between the organisers and the police, as it's not clear who is the leader and the group does not liaise with the local officers.\n\n\"That's what all peaceful protesters do, and we would really respect if they followed the rules around that,\" Hernandez said while speaking to the BBC.\n\nStarmer announced a \"standing army\" of 6,000 specialist police officers will be put together to address the riots on Monday, but there are currently no plans to get the Army involved.\n\nNearly 400 people have already been arrested since the unrest began last week.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police also promised on Monday that the force was \"fully resourced at this time with a strong police presence\".\n\nThe UK justice system was already facing a serious strain when Labour first got into office, with prisons weeks away from max capacity.\n\nThe government decided to release some offenders slightly early to ease the pressure.\n\nBut there's already a new risk cells could be filled up again with far-right extremists.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice also said it will create 500 more places in prisons over the next month.\n\nFormer head of UK counter-terrorism, Neil Basu, downplayed that worry, saying: \"We overestimate the intelligence of thugs. They don't think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late, but jail a few and the others will run back under cover. They are bullies and cowards.\"\n\nThe riots were galvanised by social media misinformation about the suspect at the centre of the Southport stabbings.\n\nFar-right accounts claimed the suspect was an asylum seeker, and on MI6's watch list. Neither allegation was true.\n\nStarmer vowed to crack down on social media companies for not policing their platforms, saying it was a crime to let such hatred grow.\n\n\"It's happening on your premises, and the law must be upheld everywhere,\" he said.\n\nX boss Elon Musk then waded into the conversation around the riots, saying \"civil war is inevitable\" in the UK now, which sparked the No.10 spokesperson to say there is \"no justification\" for such comments.\n\nThe government has pledged to \"stop the spread of hateful information\" online.\n\nTechnology secretary Peter Kyle met with TikTok, Meta, Google and X this week, and was looking at if hostile state actors accelerated any fake posts.\n\nIn the meantime, charities like Tell MAMA are calling for fines for social media companies.\n\nDuties on social media firms are expected under the Online Safety Act but that won't be introduced for several months.\n\nThe PM has so far rejected calls for parliament to end its summer recess so that MPs can debate what should happen next with this wave of violence.\n\nStarmer said: \"My focus is on making sure that we stop this disorder, that the criminal sanctions are swift and be seen to be followed.\"\n\nBut that's not the case across the whole country - the Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled to Stormont early, after a wave of far-right violence in Belfast.\n\nMPs and 60 anti-racist and migrants' right organisations called for parliament to be recalled as well, \"to ensure that all people and communities of colour are protected.\"\n\nThere's been plenty of finger-pointing over where this surge in far-right sentiment has come from.\n\nMany are blaming the Conservatives for their anti-migrant rhetoric which they have been ramping up in recent years - former home secretary Suella Braverman once called the arrival of refugees on British shores an \"invasion\".\n\nOthers blame Starmer after he \"dithered and delayed\" in calling an emergency COBRA meeting, according to Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick.\n\nFormer Tory chair and peer Sayeeda Warsi said: \"When the government responds to this, they absolutely have to be brave enough to say, 'where has this really come from? Who has been feeding this beast? Who has created the racist rhetoric? Who is poisoning the public discourse?'\"\n\nReassuringly, these thuggish beliefs are not too pervasive within British society.\n\nA YouGov poll shows just 7% of Brits support the riots, 8% have sympathy for their views and only 12% think they're justified.\n\nMore riots are expected.\n\nAn organisation which monitoring of anti-Muslim attacks, Tell MAMA, even said it had alerted counter-terrorism police to some of the next wave of riots expected.\n\nThe \"far-right threats on Telegram that seek to target immigration solicitors and refugee services\" in more than 30 locations across the UK on Wednesday.\n\nIn the meantime, it remains unclear if Keir Starmer will go on his pre-planned holiday later this week.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

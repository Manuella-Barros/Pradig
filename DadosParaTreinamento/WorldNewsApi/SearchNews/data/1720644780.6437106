You can subscribe to Subtext here, text Hoynsie at 216-208-4346 for a two-week free trial or email him at phoynes@cleveland.com. Hey Hoynsie: How does MLB decide how many at-bats are necessary for a player such as Steven Kwan to qualify for the AL batting title? -- Jeff Einerson, Hailey, Idaho. Hey, Jeff: MLB determined that a player needed 3.1 plate appearances per his team\u2019s scheduled game to qualify for the batting, slugging percentage and onbase percentage titles. It means the minimum number of plate appearances a player needs in a 162-game season is 502. Kwan is off that pace after missing four weeks with a left hamstring injury. He entered Saturday night\u2019s game against the Marlins averaging 2.63 plate appearances in the Guardians\u2019 first 62 games. But if he stays healthy and maintains his current pace of 4.53 plate appearances per game (163 plate appearances in 36 games), he\u2019s on track to qualify for the batting title. In his first two years in the big leagues, Kwan averaged 3.9 and 4.4 plate appearances per game. He enters Saturday night hitting .356 (54 for 148). Bobby Witt Jr., is leading the AL in batting at .323 (83 for 257). Hey, Hoynsie: The Guardians are 21-8 at home this season. When I show up to watch them, they are 3-5. Do the Guardians have a program to pay unlucky fans to stay away? -- Greg Klepzig, Sylvania. Hey, Greg: I don\u2019t think something like that is in the budget. But if you took your record to Guaranteed Rate Field, the White Sox would consider you a good luck charm. Hey, Hoynsie: Do you think the arrival and early success of versatile Daniel Schneemann will spell the end of Gabriel Arias\u2019 roster spot? -- Darron, Parma. Hey, Darron: I\u2019m all for Schneemann and seeing what he can do. But he\u2019s been in the big leagues for a minute. Why don\u2019t you give yourself a chance to watch him play for a while before reaching any definitive conclusions. Hey, Hoynsie: Entering the middle of the season, what aspect of the team concerns you the most? -- Ted, Westlake Village, California. Hey, Ted: Starting pitching, starting pitching and starting pitching. Hey, Hoynsie: What has David Fry done to sit behind Bo Naylor and Brayan Rocchio? His numbers are fantastic. -- Frank Stanton, North Royalton. Hey, Frank: Fry is having a great year, and with Bo Naylor nursing a sore left shoulder, he should get more time behind the plate. But he\u2019s already as close to being a starter as a player can be. As for being blocked by Rocchio, I think you\u2019re comparing apples to oranges. Rocchio plays shortstop. Hey, Hoynsie: How is attendance, and is it good enough that the Guards could pick up a good pitcher or bat at the trade deadline? -- Arthur Flicker, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Hey, Arthur: Through 29 home dates at Progressive Field, attendance has increased by almost 100,000 -- 554,071 in 2023 compared to 653,336 in 2024. But I don\u2019t think that would be enough for the Guardians to go wild in the trade market. Unless you turn back the clock to the 1990s when the Indians were drawing three million fans a year, I\u2019m not sure attendance is the driving force behind this organization making stretch-run trades. That always comes down to ownership, and to be fair they\u2019ve always made moves when they felt they had a real chance to do damage in October. Overall, the Guardians rank 22nd out 30 teams in attendance. Hey, Hoynsie: What are the chances of the Guardians acquiring power-hitting Luis Robert Jr. from the White Sox? I know he\u2019s often injured, but he did hit 38 homers last year. -- Greg Cooksey. Hey, Greg: It\u2019s hard to make a deal with a divisional opponent. The asking price always goes higher. Robert has played only 10 games this year because of a right hip injury. He\u2019s part of that group of talented players that the White Sox have assembled over the last several years with few encouraging results. He\u2019s making $12.5 million this year and $15 million next year before becoming a free agent. I\u2019d say approach with caution. Hey, Hoynsie: It seems the Guardians\u2019 \u201ccatcher of the future\u201d isn\u2019t ready for to their catcher now. A trip to Columbus might help Bo Naylor, especially with David Fry hitting well. -- Charlie Bentley, North Ridgeville. Hey, Charlie: It\u2019s a fair question and it\u2019s fair to say the Guardians have discussed the idea. If they do make a move, it will be because they feel it will help Naylor and the team. I know Naylor has received most of the playing time behind the plate, but he never seems to be in the lineup for a consistent stretch of games. The problem is magnified with Fry playing well no matter where he plays, Naylor struggling at the plate and the Guardians being in first place. Now Naylor has a sore left shoulder, so we\u2019ll have to see how that is resolved.

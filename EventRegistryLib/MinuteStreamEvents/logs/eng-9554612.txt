Instead, it tears prey into manageable pieces, which it swallows whole.\n\nWith its heavy, torpedo-shaped body, the shark can cruise efficiently for long periods and then swiftly switch to high-speed bursts, even leaping out of the water in pursuit of prey. It has a diverse diet, ranging from small fish like halibut to larger prey such as seals and dolphins.\n\nHow to Participate in Village Wild: Video of the month\n\nSubmitting your entry is easy.

He is also President of Atlantic Shark Expeditions and Executive Director of the Shark Research Foundation. (The Weather Network)\n\nRELATED: Great white shark cage diving expedition coming to Canada's East Coast\n\nSo, where exactly do the sharks swim to when they sense bad weather is coming? Hammerschlag thinks it's off to deeper water where they can escape the impacts of the pressure.\n\nThe sightings stopped five days before Hurricane Lee hit the province of Nova Scotia and their absence lasted for the five days following.\n\nIn total, Hammerschlag observed 36 great white sharks and hundreds of blue sharks last year and he hopes his sightings data will help build a baseline to gauge how many sharks are out there off the Canadian province.\n\n\"Ocean climate plays such an important role in the sharks behaviour because their biology and physiology is linked to temperatures and they're likely swimming around following different ocean frontal systems and edges of warm water because these areas are usually productive upwelling areas, lots of nutrients,\" he says.\n\nAtlantic Shark Expeditions was established in 2023 by Hammerschlag to provide unparalleled opportunities for the public to experience, discover, and help protect the wonders of sharks through ecotourism and citizen science. This year, the expedition will depart from the Halifax harbour.

It will occur this year on May 10. This special day is devoted to Elasmobranchii, a subclass of cartilaginous fish that includes sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish. Five to seven pairs of independently opening gill clefts, rigid dorsal fins, and microscopic placoid skin scales characterize these aquatic organisms. Ruth Musgrave, director and inventor of Whale Times, established Fintastic Friday to raise awareness about shark, ray, skate, and sawfish conservation.\n\nFintastic Friday was established on the second Friday of May, 2015, to give sharks, skates, and rays a voice. It was founded by Whale Times, an organization founded in 1995 under the leadership of Ruth Musgrave with the purpose of connecting children with the ocean. Promoting awareness and encouraging advocacy for the preservation of elasmobranchs is the objective of Fintastic Friday. Included in this subclass of cartilaginous fish are sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish.\n\nChildren, in his opinion, are the future of sharks because no one is more enthusiastic or boisterous than a considerate child. They desire not only that children from all over the world disseminate the message of shark conservation, but also that they demonstrate daily respect and awareness for sharks. The team responsible for developing Whale Times was motivated by their desire to facilitate children's access to marine science information and to advocate for conservation efforts aimed at preserving some of the ocean's most magnificent creatures. They also seek to unite students, researchers, the ocean, and ocean research through formal and informal educational programs. Presently, educators, marine scientists, and other scientific organizations hold the organization in high regard for motivating students to embark on marine science professions and devise strategies to safeguard our ocean environments.\n\nMusgrave, in his capacity as the director of Whale Times, asserts that a reevaluation of public perception regarding sharks is warranted, given the essential importance that their survival holds for the survival of all oceanic species. She believes children can assist in providing them with a fresh perspective, which they need. It promotes active engagement in shark conservation initiatives and aids in the transformation of public sentiment towards sharks, transitioning from animosity to admiration, as ought to be the case with all living things in nature.\n\nOrthodox Good Friday 2024: FAQs, Dates, History, Activities, and Facts About Good Friday Traditions\n\nNational Montana Day 2024 (US): FAQs, Dates, History, and Activities\n\nAgriculture and Labor Day 2024 (Haiti): Activities, History, FAQs, Dates, and Facts About farming\n\nOn January 4, 2011, the Shark Conservation Act of 2010 was ratified, constituting an amendment to the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act and the M.S.A. The Shark Conservation Act mandates that, with one exception, all sharks encountered in the United States must be landed with their fins in their natural state.\n\nVolunteer programs should be investigated as the finest option. Assisting shark biologists in their field research, facilitating fund-raising or awareness-raising for shark conservation organizations, and even aiding in the environmental cleansing of shark waters following a disaster are all examples of volunteer programs for sharks.\n\nAs a consequence of shark extinction, coral reefs, seagrass habitats, and commercial fisheries have all declined. The herbivores are consumed by larger predatory fish, such as groupers, which flourish when sharks are absent from the coral reef ecosystem.\n\nAnnually, Whale Times organizes the national Sharks in the Park celebration in support of Shark Conservation and Fintastic Friday. One may participate in a community rally within their municipality or construct a personalized Sharks in the Park banner for display at home or in the back window of their vehicle. In this manner, you are entertainingly disseminating the word.\n\nBy endorsing the pledge, individuals commit to consuming exclusively sustainable seafood and advocating for legislative reforms in nations that permit or endorse the sale of shark fins, the finning fishery, or other unrestrained fishing practices that endanger sharks. Additionally, you may nominate and motivate family and friends to accept the pledge.\n\nOne of the numerous methods of raising funds and bringing attention to a worthy cause is by producing one-of-a-kind works of art that can be sold and the proceeds donated to local sealife charities and organizations.

Find out here", "body": "Most of us have seen plenty of fish in aquariums, ponds, rivers and lakes. But have you ever wondered which fish is the largest fish in the world?\n\nThe largest fish in the world is the whale shark. In case you are wondering whether it is a whale or a shark, it is a species of shark. Let us know more about this gigantic fish.\n\nThe reason why this shark has 'whale' attached to its name is solely due to its sheer size. Despite being bigger than the great white shark, which is the deadliest sea creature on our planet, whale sharks are harmless to humans and are considered gentle giants.\n\nIn fact, they are so docile that scuba divers tend to swim around them and take pictures with them underwater.\n\nAdult whale sharks can grow up to 40 feet in length and weigh more than 40 tonnes. They have broad, flat heads and their grey skin is filled with white spots. There is no clear data on their lifespan, but scientist estimate that these creatures may live up to 60-100 years.\n\nWhale sharks are found in tropical and warm-temperate seas around the world as they prefer water temperatures of 20-25 degree Celsius. They mostly eat small organisms like plankton, small squids, and schooling fish.\n\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the conservation status of the whale shark is endangered. This is due to increasing levels of pollution in our oceans and illegal poaching of these creatures for fins, skins, and oil.", "source": {"uri": "kalingatv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KalingaTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great white shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuba diving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoaling and schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plankton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poaching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Union for Conservation of Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/whaleshark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554612", "eventUri": "eng-9554612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

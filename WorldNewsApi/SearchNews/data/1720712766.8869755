During her speech as keynote speaker at the Michigan Democratic Party Legacy Dinner on Saturday night, the VP called Trump a \u201ccheater,\u201d Mediate reported. While in earlier weeks, Joe Biden has shared his two cents on Trump, this is the first time Harris went all in on the former president. She highlighted his attempt to overturn the last election and his attacks on the justice system, based on the claim that his hush money trials were unfair, all to paint him as ill-equipped to run for the 2024 presidential election. The VP called to her audience to examine the facts, as she saw them: \u201cYou know why he complains? Because the reality is, cheaters don\u2019t like getting caught,\u201d Politico reported. She added, \u201cAnd since the verdict, he attacks the judge and the witnesses. He suggests the case could be a \u201cbreaking point\u201d for his supporters, hinting at violence. He spreads lies that our Administration is controlling this case when everyone knows it was a state prosecution. And he says that he will use a second term for revenge.\u201d She claimed that Trump parading around as though he is above the law should disqualify him from becoming president. All this said, what incited heckling from the crowd was not the VPs remarks on Trump, but her comments about hostages being rescued from Gaza. \"Before I begin, I just want to say a few words about the morning, which I know weighs heavily on all of our hearts,\" she said. \"On October 7th, Hamas committed a brutal massacre of 1,200 innocent people and abducted 250 hostages. Thankfully, four of those hostages were reunited with their families tonight. And we mourn all of the innocent lives that have been lost in Gaza, including those tragically killed today.\" At this, a heckler began shouting from their seat, and was immediately shut down, according to Fox Detroit. \"I\u2019m speaking right now,\" Harris said to the heckler, before they were escorted out. \"I value and respect your voice, but I'm speaking right now.\"", "summary": "\"Cheaters don\u2019t like getting caught,\" Harris said of Trump at the Michigan Democratic Party dinner", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2024/06/09/vp-kamala-harris-says-conviction-should-be-disqualifying/", "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/06/kamala-harris_-2155825482jpg.jpg ?>", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:02:25", "author": "Nandika Chatterjee", "authors": ["Nandika Chatterjee"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.283}

{"id": 243230114, "title": "St. Paul man sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison for two sexual assaults five years apart", "text": "One of Francisco Alejandro Chale\u2019s sexual assault victims stood before him in court Friday and listened as her sister read a statement on her behalf. \u201cI went out that night to spend time with my best friend,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went out that night to hurt someone.\u201d Chale, 29, of St. Paul, pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct in April for raping the woman in May 2022 in St. Paul after she got into his car thinking it was an Uber following a night of drinking at a downtown Minneapolis bar. Chale also pleaded guilty to a June 2022 charge of second-degree criminal sexual conduct for assaulting a woman in his car in St. Paul in February 2017. Ramsey County District Judge Joy Bartscher followed a plea agreement, which included imposing consecutive sentences for each offense, and gave Chale a total of 19\u00bd years in prison. Charges of kidnapping to facilitate a felony and false imprisonment were dismissed, per the agreement. Chale has an open third-degree criminal sexual conduct case in Hennepin County, with charges alleging he assaulted a vulnerable adult in his van in Richfield in May 2021. A jury trial is scheduled for July 8. Thought it was an Uber According to the criminal complaint in the 2022 attack, a resident in the 700 block of Slate Street on St. Paul\u2019s West Side reported about 4 a.m. May 15 that a distraught woman had pounded on his door and said she was just raped by an unknown man. Officers located the woman pacing and crying and wearing a dress that was partially ripped. She was transported to Regions Hospital, where she gave police a statement and underwent a sexual assault examination. She reported getting into a car she thought was an Uber in Minneapolis and that she was taken against her will to St. Paul where the suspect, later identified as Chale, threatened to kill her and raped her. She said she was able to break away from the man and run to a nearby house. She told police she and two friends, identified as AG and DJS, had gone to a bar and met up with other people. The woman said she had \u201clots\u201d of drinks and at closing time she and AG decided to walk to DJS\u2019s apartment, according to the charges. The woman reported that she was going in and out of consciousness and that she lost AG as they were walking. She said she became more alert when she realized she was in the passenger seat of a car driven by an unknown man whom she believed to be of Hispanic descent. When the vehicle stopped, the woman said she tried to open the car door because she sensed something was wrong. She said the man then \u201cjumped\u201d on top of her from the driver\u2019s seat and raped her, the complaint read. She said she somehow fell out of the vehicle. The woman\u2019s sister told police that she received a text from her with the word \u201cHelp\u201d at about 3:30 a.m. Video and audio from a church in the 600 block of Livingston Avenue in St. Paul indicated a struggle off camera and a male with a Latino accent telling someone to get back into the car. A short time later, the woman is seen running through the church parking lot and then falling to the ground, where she remained for several minutes. DNA profiling taken during the sexual assault examination, and a known sample obtained from Chale in an unrelated criminal sexual conduct investigation, revealed a match, the complaint says. Earlier victim met up with \u2018Oscar\u2019 The woman assaulted in 2017 told police the day of the attack that she had been introduced to the man by a friend. She reported that she only knew him as \u201cOscar\u201d and that he had a Facebook profile name of \u201cOscar Hernandez.\u201d She told police that she agreed to meet up with him to talk and that they ended up in his car near her East Side apartment complex. Chale told the woman, \u201cYou should give me a Mexican baby\u201d and tried to kiss her. She rebuffed his advances, and he locked the car doors and forcibly groped her, the charges say. She told him to stop, and he tried ripping her pants off. He got her pants partially down and masturbated. \u201cOscar\u2019s\u201d true identity was not known to St. Paul police until March 10, 2022, when they received a report from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension stating that swabs taken from the woman\u2019s neck and breast during a sexual assault examination on the day of the assault matched Chale\u2019s DNA, according to the charges. Investigators located the woman to inform her of the results. She said that though she never saw her attacker again after the assault more than five years ago, she remembered his face and would be able to identify him. A police investigator administered a sequential photo lineup and she identified Chale \u201cwith 100 percent certainty.\u201d \u2018Did I deserve this?\u2019 The woman in the 2022 attack said Friday that she will always wonder why he chose to rape her that night. \u201cWhy did it have to be me? Did I look easy? Was my dress too short or was I too drunk? \u2026 Did I deserve this?\u201d she told the court. She said she is \u201cfeeling the weight of responsibility for standing up for others that went through this nightmare, too.\u201d She said she hopes she can \u201cfeel safe again \u2026 that one day I can enjoy the quiet of the night, and I hope the nightmares will stop.\u201d Before imposing Chale\u2019s sentence, Bartscher asked him if there was anything he wanted to say. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. Bartscher told the woman that she was courageous. \u201cAnd I say the same thing often to folks like you or people in your situation, but this is only one part of your life,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThis should not define you, and I hope that you can make it to a point where you can get beyond this.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cI went out that night to spend time with my best friend,\u201d one victim said. \u201cHe went out that night to hurt someone.\u201d", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2024/06/28/st-paul-man-sentenced-two-sexual-assaults/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/city-hall-courthouse.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:39:21", "author": "Nick Ferraro", "authors": ["Nick Ferraro"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.444}

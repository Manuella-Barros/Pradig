The invasion followed a coup that aimed at a union with Greece, which was backed by the Junta then ruling in Athens.\n\nIn the south, the howl of air raid sirens at daybreak began a solemn day marking what Greek Cypriots remember as a catastrophe that left thousands of people dead or missing and displaced a quarter of the Greek Cypriot population.\n\nErdogan's remarks may further complicate U.N.

The Turkish Cypriot side, as equals with the Greek side, are willing to negotiate and are ready to sit down and negotiate. If you want a solution, you need to recognize the rights of Turkish Cypriots.\"\n\nTurkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar reiterated that Turkish Cypriots reject \"domination\" by the Greek Cypriot majority and seek \"equal national status\" for their breakaway state they unilaterally declared in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey. He added that there's now \"no common ground\" for a return to peace negotiations.\n\nReferring to a recent resolution in the Ankara parliament calling for a two-state solution, Tatar said it \"will help us and our cause incredibly.\"\n\nThe island's Greek Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides urged Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to re-engage in reunification talks if Ankara genuinely seeks regional security and stability and to nudge closer to the European Union.\n\nAfter numerous failed rounds of peace negotiations, many Cypriots on both sides - although jaded - still hold out a glimmer of hope for a peace deal.\n\nGreek Cypriot commemorations include the unveiling of memorials to fallen heroes, church services and a gathering late Saturday at the Presidential Palace addressed - for the first time - by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\n\nErdogan earlier presided over \"golden jubilee\" events, replete with a visit by Turkey's first amphibious assault ship to carry the country's potent Bayraktar drones, and an airshow.\n\nThe European Union, which Cyprus joined in 2004, urged both sides to show \"genuine commitment\" to a peace deal in line with U.N. resolutions.\n\n\"Too much time has been lost,\" an EU spokesperson said. \"A forced division can never be a solution.

If you want a solution, you need to recognize the rights of Turkish Cypriots.\"\n\nTurkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar reiterated that Turkish Cypriots reject \"domination\" by the Greek Cypriot majority and seek \"equal national status\" for their breakaway state they unilaterally declared in 1983, which is only recognised by Turkey.\n\nHe added that there's now \"no common ground\" for a return to peace negotiations.\n\nReferring to a recent resolution in the Ankara parliament calling for a two-state solution, Mr Tatar said it \"will help us and our cause incredibly\".\n\nThe island's Greek Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides urged Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to re-engage in reunification talks if Ankara genuinely seeks regional security and stability and to nudge closer to the European Union.\n\nAfter numerous failed rounds of peace negotiations, many Cypriots on both sides -- although jaded -- still hold out a glimmer of hope for a peace deal.\n\nGreek Cypriot commemorations include the unveiling of memorials to fallen heroes, church services and a gathering late Saturday at the Presidential Palace addressed -- for the first time -- by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\n\nMr Erdogan earlier presided over \"golden jubilee\" events, replete with a visit by Turkey's first amphibious assault ship to carry the country's potent Bayraktar drones, and an airshow.\n\nThe European Union, which Cyprus joined in 2004, urged both sides to show \"genuine commitment\" to a peace deal in line with UN resolutions.\n\n\"Too much time has been lost,\" an EU spokesperson said.\n\n\"A forced division can never be a solution.

Only Turkey recognizes a subsequent Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island's northern third where it keeps more than 35,000 troops.\n\nThe Associated Press was allowed unique access inside the United Nations 180-kilometer (about (110-mile) buffer zone where its troops have been situated since 1974 to preserve the peace between Turkish and Turkish Cypriot troops on one side and Greek Cypriot national guardsmen.\n\nThe marks of war are ubiquitous; from the pock-marked walls of homes and businesses targeted by large-caliber gunfire to hastily-constructed brick-and-mortar gun nests facing off each other. But the eeriest sensation comes from how a capital's heart stopped mid-beat along the hasty exodus of people fleeing for their lives, leaving everything behind.\n\nThe U.N. says tensions along the buffer zone are again being ratcheted up with the appearance of hundreds of new firing positions and high-tech surveillance technology with possible military applications.\n\nTalks about forming a federation composed of Greek and Turkish-speaking zones have been stalemated since the last U.N. facilitated bid seven years ago. Many failed attempts preceded that.\n\nNow, a Turkish and Turkish Cypriot shift away from a federation and toward a two-state deal that Greek Cypriots have dismissed outright is jeopardizing a renewed bid by U.N.

The invasion followed a coup that aimed at a union with Greece, which was backed by the Junta then ruling in Athens, according to The AP.\n\nIn the south, the howl of air raid sirens at daybreak began a solemn day marking what Greek Cypriots remember as a catastrophe that left thousands of people dead or missing and displaced a quarter of the Greek Cypriot population.\n\nErdogan's remarks may further complicate UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' effort to get both sides back to the negotiating table. His personal envoy, Maria Angela Holguin Cuellar, has spent the past six months scoping both sides out.\n\n\"We will continue to fight with determination for the recognition of the TRNC (breakaway Turkish Cypriot state) and the implementation of a two-state solution,\" Erdogan told throngs of Turkish Cypriots lining the parade route in scorching heat in the northern half of the divided capital, Nicosia.\n\n\"A federal solution in Cyprus is not possible, this is what we believe. ... The Turkish Cypriot side, as equals with the Greek side, are willing to negotiate and are ready to sit down and negotiate. If you want a solution, you need to recognize the rights of Turkish Cypriots.\"\n\nTurkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar reiterated that Turkish Cypriots reject \"domination\" by the Greek Cypriot majority and seek \"equal national status\" for their breakaway state they unilaterally declared in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey. He added that there's now \"no common ground\" for a return to peace negotiations.\n\nReferring to a recent resolution in the Ankara parliament calling for a two-state solution, Tatar said it \"will help us and our cause incredibly.\"\n\nThe island's Greek Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides urged T\u00fcrkiye and the Turkish Cypriots to re-engage in reunification talks if Ankara genuinely seeks regional security and stability and to nudge closer to the European Union.\n\nAfter numerous failed rounds of peace negotiations, many Cypriots on both sides -- although jaded -- still hold out

Turkish Cypriots want a two-state settlement.\n\nCyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and led to the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force.\n\nThe crisis left Greek Cypriots running the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union since 2004 with the potential to derail Turkey's own decades-long aspirations of joining the bloc.\n\nRemembering the dead\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, whose office represents the Greek Cypriot community in the reunification dialogue, said the anniversary was a somber occasion for reflection and for remembering the dead.\n\n\"Our mission is liberation, reunification and solving the Cyprus problem,\" he said. \"If we really want to send a message on this tragic anniversary ... it is to do anything possible to reunite Cyprus.\"\n\nTurkey, he said, continued to be responsible for violating human rights and international law over Cyprus.\n\nA UN Peacekeeper walks towards to a gate by the abandoned buildings inside the UN-controlled buffer zone in the central of Nicosia on June 18.\n\nPetros Karadjias/AP\n\nAcross the south, church services were held to remember the more than 3,000 people who died in the Turkish invasion.\n\n\"It was a betrayal of Cyprus and so many kids were lost. It wasn't just my son, it was many,\" said Loukas Alexandrou, 90, as he tended the grave of his son at a military cemetery.\n\nIn Turkey, state television focused on violence against Turkish Cypriots prior to the invasion, particularly on bloodshed in 1963-64 and in 1967.\n\nTurkey's invasion took more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south.\n\nReunification talks collapsed in 2017 and have been at a stalemate since.

Only Turkey recognizes a subsequent Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island's northern third where it keeps more than 35,000 troops.\n\nThe Associated Press was allowed unique access inside the United Nations 180-kilometer (about (110-mile) buffer zone where its troops have been situated since 1974 to preserve the peace between Turkish and Turkish Cypriot troops on one side and Greek Cypriot national guardsmen.\n\nThe marks of war are ubiquitous; from the pock-marked walls of homes and businesses targeted by large-caliber gunfire to hastily-constructed brick-and-mortar gun nests facing off each other. But the eeriest sensation comes from how a capital's heart stopped mid-beat along the hasty exodus of people fleeing for their lives, leaving everything behind.\n\nThe U.N. says tensions along the buffer zone are again being ratcheted up with the appearance of hundreds of new firing positions and high-tech surveillance technology with possible military applications.\n\nTalks about forming a federation composed of Greek and Turkish-speaking zones have been stalemated since the last U.N. facilitated bid seven years ago. Many failed attempts preceded that.\n\nNow, a Turkish and Turkish Cypriot shift away from a federation and toward a two-state deal that Greek Cypriots have dismissed outright is jeopardizing a renewed bid by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to get the two sides back to the negotiating table.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But for 50 years it has been split in two after a deadly war.\n\nMichael Drummond\n\nForeign news reporter @MikeRDrummond\n\nSaturday 20 July 2024 12:00, UK\n\nFor 50 years, Cyprus has been split in two by a military border, the constant reminder of a deadly conflict that has never been resolved.\n\nThe island, visited by more than a million Brits each year, is famed for its crystal clear waters, pristine beaches and rich culture, but the tiny country in the Mediterranean has a bloody history which provokes strong emotion to this day.\n\n\"We are lost souls,\" Greek Cypriot Mario Pischiris says. He was just a boy when war broke out in Cyprus on 20 July, 1974 - exactly 50 years ago.\n\nHe was forced to flee with his mother and brother.\n\nNow 53 and living in London, the unsettled conflict in the country where he was born remains an emotional subject, as it does for thousands of Greek and Turkish Cypriots worldwide.\n\nTurkish Cypriot Kenan Denizkan says the days after the 1974 conflict broke out were \"the darkest week in the history of our island\".\n\nFor some, today's 50th anniversary of the conflict is a painful one, for others it is a reason for celebration.\n\nWhat happened in Cyprus?\n\nCyprus was under British rule for nearly 100 years before gaining independence in 1960. Turkey, Britain and Greece were named guarantors of the island's sovereignty with rights to intervene if there was a breakdown of constitutional order.\n\nDuring the first few years of independence, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots participated in power sharing but in 1963 a dispute left Greek Cypriots effectively running the country.\n\nViolence erupted in December 1963, prompting the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force to the island.\n\nOn 20 July 1974, Turkey sent warships and troops to Cyprus after the military government in mainland Greece staged a coup and toppled the legitimate island government.\n\nHundreds died in the subsequent fighting and the conflict led to the division of the island between the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Greek Cypriot Republic of Cyprus.\n\nTo this day the island remains divided by a secure border with often lengthy queues for a passport check at the various checkpoints.\n\nThe capital, Nicosia, is the only divided capital city in the world.\n\n\"Essentially what we saw is the division of the communities, not just the division of the island,\" says author James Ker-Lindsay, an expert on Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations.\n\nOver the ensuing decades there have been multiple attempts to reach a peace deal, with some arguing for unification and others for a two-state solution, whereby the island would remain divided but each side would govern their own part and the Turkish side would be internationally recognised.\n\nBut no such agreement has ever been reached.\n\nWhat's the situation now?\n\nThe Turkish side of Cyprus, around 34% of the island, is not internationally recognised and the only direct flights are to and from Turkey.\n\nAlthough it has been years since there was any violence between the two sides, 30,000 Turkish troops remain in the north and both sides have security concerns.\n\nAs many as 250,000 people - both Greek and Turkish Cypriots - were displaced by the fighting and many have been unable to return to their homes on either side of the border.\n\nTensions exist over things like wider politics and security.\n\nThe unresolved conflict also presents issues in perhaps unexpected areas, like exports of Cyprus' famous squeaky cheese: halloumi - or hellim.\n\nFor many years, Turkish Cypriots could not sell their hellim in Europe, unlike their Greek Cypriot counterparts across the border.\n\nAlthough the island is divided and for many years it was difficult to cross, nowadays the borders are always busy with Greeks and Turks crossing over.\n\nWith a plummeting Turkish Lira, Greeks cross to fill up their tanks because of cheaper fuel prices, and to gamble in the many casinos. Turks cross the border to shop and sometimes to access better healthcare, as well as to travel out of the country from Larnaca International Airport.\n\nOf course, both groups also cross the borders to socialise with their Greek and Turkish Cypriot friends, and to visit their old villages.\n\n\"There's a lot more engagement between the two communities [nowadays], it's not a rarity anymore,\" Mr Ker-Lindsay says.\n\nHowever, there is still a \"significant proportion\" of the Greek Cypriots who refuse to cross, he says.\n\n\"They take the position that they aren't going to show their passport or an identity document in their own country.\"\n\nBut the two communities share many cultural things - food, for instance.\n\nGreek and Turkish Cypriots both enjoy a popular street food-style snack of deep-fried bulgur wheat with a mince meat filling, for example, but in the south you'd ask for koupes - while in the north it's bulgur kofte, with lamb, rather than pork.\n\nGreek Cypriots generally follow the Greek Orthodox Church while Turkish Cypriots follow Islam.\n\n'We are a divided country and divided nation'\n\nMario still has the suitcase his mother used when they and his little brother fled the Turkish military in 1974. They were Greek Cypriots living in the village of Komi Kebir in what is now the Turkish side.\n\n\"My first memories of life as a three-year-old was to see trauma at the highest level. Everyone was fearing for their lives,\" he says. \"People were being ushered out of their homes.\"\n\n\"My dad had to stay and fight, so we didn't know what was going to happen to him.\"\n\nAt the Cypriot Community Centre in London, a deliberately bipartisan initiative, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots come together to enjoy their shared culture.\n\nIt's frequented by many of the thousands of people who fled the conflict and settled in north London, and their descendants.\n\nFor Mario and his family, the area made sense as a destination because his grandparents ran a restaurant in Islington that was popular with the Greek Cypriot community.\n\nMario says the happiest moment of his young life was when, some months later, his father walked into the restaurant whistling a little tune.\n\n\"My parents had nothing, they literally had nothing. And I always felt a sense of responsibility to try and fix that.\"\n\nHis family home in the northern side still stands, but he has never been able to move back, he says.\n\nMario is reflective when it comes to blame. He thinks if you asked a consensus of the Greek Cypriot refugees who came to London in 1974, there wouldn't be a lot of bitterness towards Turkish Cypriots.\n\n\"When you were in Cyprus at the time [before the conflict] you were co-living with Turkish Cypriots and you knew it wasn't their fault. They didn't want any of that... remember, they lost their homes.\"\n\nKenan Denizkan is from a Turkish Cypriot family and was 14 years old when the 1974 conflict broke out.\n\nHis family had been living in Limassol (modern day Republic of Cyprus) and says that due to the division of the country they had to cross into the Turkish side and settled in Kyrenia - Girne as it's called in the north.\n\n\"The people who lived on the island were not the ones to decide about our future,\" he says. \"It was always our motherlands: Greece and Turkey.\"\n\nAfter living in Turkey and working as a cargo ship captain for 20 years, Kenan moved to London for a while and now lives in Northern Cyprus once again where he works to preserve the green space around where he lives.\n\n\"We are a divided country and divided nation,\" he says, adding that he would like to see his homeland unified once again.\n\n\"Unfortunately I am coming to an age that I am really concerned about my grandchildren, that they will never see this country the way I wanted to see it,\" he says.\n\n\"I am not celebrating and I do not want to remember it,\" he says.\n\n\"If half of the country is crying and the other half is celebrating, this is not celebration.\"\n\nAnother Kenan, Kenan Nafi, is chairman of the CTCA, an organisation that brings together various associations in the UK's Turkish Cypriot community.\n\nFor him, today marks \"50 years of peace\" since Turkish soldiers arrived in 1974 and a time for celebration.\n\n\"This was intervention, not invasion. Turkey had the right to unilaterally intervene to defend Turkish Cypriots... that's exactly what they did,\" he says, arguing that there would still be unrest today if this had not happened.\n\nHe says it was a trauma which affected both communities which in 50 years have not recovered.\n\nHe also talks about what he calls the oppression of Turkish Cypriots.\n\n\"They don't even have the right to internationally represent their country on basic human rights like sports... We don't have the right to directly travel to our country.\n\n\"We need to sit down - two-state solution.\n\n\"The world is evolved, the world is changed. They need to realise human beings have the right to live freely in their country.\"\n\nWhile there is a split between those who want to remain divided and those who don't, each side shares one enduring feeling - a love of the island.\n\nSky News", "source": {"uri": "parikiaki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Parikiaki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is of no benefit to anyone to say let's continue negotiations where we left off in Switzerland years ago,\" Erdogan said in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is only recognised by Ankara.\n\n\"The Turkish Cypriot side should sit at the table as equals with the Greek Cypriot side. We are ready to negotiate and achieve lasting peace and a solution,\" he said before watching a parade that included marching bands and armoured military vehicles.\n\nOn the other side of Nicosia, the world's last divided capital, President Nikos Christodoulides unveiled busts of officers killed in the fighting. He also laid a wreath at a war memorial where ceremonial gunfire sounded.\n\n\"Whatever Mr Erdogan and his representatives in the occupied areas do or say, Turkey, 50 years later, continues to be responsible for the violation of human rights of the entire Cypriot people and for the violation of international law,\" Christodoulides told reporters.\n\nDecades on, fresh tears flowed for those who died during the invasion.\n\nUnder a hot sun at the war memorial, a mother clad in black cried over the tomb of her son. She ran her hand gently over a photo of the young man attached to a marble cross. Other women wiped their eyes nearby.\n\nGreek flags waved on graves that stretched out in rows around them as mourners placed flowers and incense.\n\nMore than 750 Greek Cypriots and almost 200 Turkish Cypriots remain missing, says the bi-communal Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus which tries to find and return their remains to loved ones.\n\nBefore the anniversary, some Greek Cypriot veterans of the fight against the invasion told AFP they saw no hope for reunification.\n\n\"Perhaps, what was completely broken in 1974, cannot be fixed,\" the English-language Cyprus Mail newspaper wrote in an editorial Saturday.\n\n\"They probably consider reunification too big a risk to take,\" it said, and most people on both side \"have no experience other than that of a divided country.\"\n\nA United Nations envoy, Colombian diplomat Maria Angela Holguin, wrote in an open letter this month of a need to \"move away\" from past solutions and to \"think differently\".\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was set to visit Cyprus on Saturday evening to attend the commemorations alongside Christodoulides.\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary, Turkey's parliament adopted a resolution calling for an \"end to the inhumane isolation imposed on Turkish Cypriots\".\n\nThe European Union - to which Cyprus belongs - stressed the need for all parties to seek a peaceful resolution \"on the basis of relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\"\n\nIrfan Siddiq, Britain's high commissioner to Cyprus, said on social media platform X that, \"Too many opportunities for re-unification have been missed.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in a report this month to the Security Council, said \"resolution of the Cyprus issue is long overdue\".\n\nGuterres regretted \"the gradual militarisation that is under way on the island\".\n\nThe invasion was triggered by a coup in Nicosia backed by the military junta in Athens and aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece.\n\nThe treaty that granted Cyprus independence from Britain in 1960 banned union with Greece or Turkey as well as partition and made London, Athens and Ankara guarantors of Cyprus's independence, territorial integrity and security.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Turkish Cypriots want a two-state settlement.\n\nCyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and led to the dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force.\n\nThe crisis left Greek Cypriots running the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union since 2004 with the potential to derail Turkey's own decades-long aspirations of joining the bloc.\n\nREMEMBERING THE DEAD\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, whose office represents the Greek Cypriot community in the reunification dialogue, said the anniversary was a sombre occasion for reflection and for remembering the dead.\n\n\"Our mission is liberation, reunification and solving the Cyprus problem,\" he said. \"If we really want to send a message on this tragic anniversary ... it is to do anything possible to reunite Cyprus.\"\n\nTurkey, he said, continued to be responsible for violating human rights and international law over Cyprus.\n\nAcross the south, church services were held to remember the more than 3,000 people who died in the Turkish invasion.\n\n\"It was a betrayal of Cyprus and so many kids were lost. It wasn't just my son, it was many,\" said Loukas Alexandrou, 90, as he tended the grave of his son at a military cemetery.\n\nIn Turkey, state television focussed on violence against Turkish Cypriots prior to the invasion, particularly on bloodshed in 1963-64 and in 1967.\n\nTurkey's invasion took more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south.\n\nReunification talks collapsed in 2017 and have been at a stalemate since.

On the 50th anniversary of the events of 1974, the UK reaffirms its commitment to a lasting, comprehensive and just settlement that benefits all Cypriots, within the UN parameters of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with political equality.\"\n\nWe urge all parties to demonstrate openness, flexibility and compromise, and to participate in UN-led efforts to reach a settlement.\n\nThe events of 20 July 1974 are described as an intervention by Turkey by the Turkish Cypriots and an illegal invasion by the Greek Cypriots. They occurred after what both sides acknowledge was a coup d'\u00e9tat led by a Greek Cypriot military junta with the aim of enosis or unification with Greece. Almost immediately, Greek Cypriot militias armed by Greece turned on the Turkish Cypriots and killed hundreds of people.\n\nIt is estimated that around 5,000 people from both communities, including 300 Turkish soldiers, were killed during the conflict and 200,000, including 160,000 Greek Cypriots, became refugees as they fled to their respective parts of the island.\n\nThe ensuing war saw the Turkish army occupy the north of the island and seize almost a third of the territory. The Turkish army has remained present in its bases there to this day, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) being proclaimed a decade later, although it is still not recognised by Turkey.\n\nThe TRNC has remained isolated to this day, with the UK and other countries even banning direct flights despite the presence of 300,000 Turkish Cypriots in Britain. Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith joined Mr Straw in his campaign for direct flights to be allowed on humanitarian grounds.\n\nMr Straw insisted the issue had become a deadlock because of what he described as the mistake of allowing Cyprus to join the EU in 2004 after the Greek south of the island reneged on a UN-brokered deal with Annan to reunify the island, a solution accepted by citizens of the unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). In 2017, the Cypriot government left Crans-Montana in Switzerland with a solution close at hand.\n\nWhen Ersin Tatar was elected president of the TRNC in 2020, he won on a platform backed by Mr Erdogan in favour of a two-state solution, saying that after five decades, hopes of reuniting the two communities were dead.\n\n\"These are the facts on the ground,\" he stressed. \"What we are seeing now is peaceful coexistence with two neighboring states.\"\n\nDifferent people, different language, different history, different culture. So it was our real right to create our own state, which we did. [in 1983].\n\nSince 1974, we have been separated. Young people do not know each other. They have a different language, culture and experiences. There are so many bitter experiences that there is no hope of seeing a federal relationship established in the future.\n\nMr Straw, who played a leading role in negotiations with Annan, now appears to have backed a move opposed by the British, Cypriot and Greek governments, as well as the EU and the UN.\n\nHe said: \"The possibility of partition is the only thing that could, and probably would, induce the South to compromise, because otherwise they would have a completely separate, internationally recognised and independent state in the North. The absurdity of the current situation, which makes von der Leyen's vision so laughable, is that this is de facto what we have anyway. Why should innocent people in the North continue to be punished by the inconveniences of international isolation when their negotiators have cooperated repeatedly, only to be met with stubbornness in the South?\"\n\nPresident Tatar and Turkish Cypriot activists welcomed his comments.\n\nRikki Williams and Cetin Ramadan, co-chairs of Freedom and Fairness for Northern Cyprus, said: \"As a former Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw witnessed first-hand the rejection of the Annan Plan by the Greek Cypriots in 2004 and, despite this, their entry into the European Union. This not only deepened the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots that began in 1963, but also removed any incentive for the Greek Cypriot side to negotiate a just and lasting settlement.\"\n\nTwenty years later, Jack Straw's words are truer than ever. Labour was in power in 1974, in 2004 and now in 2024. They owe it to the Turkish Cypriots to treat them as equals at the negotiating table, and to recognise their inherent sovereign rights. It is time for two states on one island. We hope that Mr Straw can speak directly to his friends in the new Labour government.\n\nBut the Cypriot government and its High Commission in London insist that a federal solution and an end to Turkish occupation must be the only acceptable outcome.\n\nDeputy High Commissioner Spyros Miltiades said: The Independent:It is clear from the above that the Cyprus problem is not a bicommunal conflict but rather a matter of illegal invasion and occupation.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If you want a solution, you need to recognize the rights of Turkish Cypriots.\"\n\nTurkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar reiterated that Turkish Cypriots reject \"domination\" by the Greek Cypriot majority and seek \"equal national status\" for their breakaway state they unilaterally declared in 1983, which is only recognised by Turkey.\n\nReferring to a recent resolution in the Ankara parliament calling for a two-state solution, Mr Tatar said it \"will help us and our cause incredibly\".\n\nThe island's Greek Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides urged Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to re-engage in reunification talks if Ankara genuinely seeks regional security and stability and to nudge closer to the European Union.\n\nAfter numerous failed rounds of peace negotiations, many Cypriots on both sides -- although jaded -- still hold out a glimmer of hope for a peace deal.\n\nMr Erdogan earlier presided over \"golden jubilee\" events, replete with a visit by Turkey's first amphibious assault ship to carry the country's potent Bayraktar drones, and an airshow.\n\nThe European Union, which Cyprus joined in 2004, urged both sides to show \"genuine commitment\" to a peace deal in line with UN resolutions.\n\n\"Too much time has been lost,\" an EU spokesperson said.\n\n\"A forced division can never be a solution.

Only Turkey recognizes a subsequent Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island\u00b4s northern third where it keeps more than 35,000 troops.\n\nThe Associated Press was allowed unique access inside the United Nations 180-kilometer (about (110-mile) buffer zone where its troops have been situated since 1974 to preserve the peace between Turkish and Turkish Cypriot troops on one side and Greek Cypriot national guardsmen.\n\nThe marks of war are ubiquitous; from the pock-marked walls of homes and businesses targeted by large-caliber gunfire to hastily-constructed brick-and-mortar gun nests facing off each other. But the eeriest sensation comes from how a capital\u00b4s heart stopped mid-beat along the hasty exodus of people fleeing for their lives, leaving everything behind.\n\nThe U.N. says tensions along the buffer zone are again being ratcheted up with the appearance of hundreds of new firing positions and high-tech surveillance technology with possible military applications.\n\nTalks about forming a federation composed of Greek and Turkish-speaking zones have been stalemated since the last U.N. facilitated bid seven years ago. Many failed attempts preceded that.\n\nAn abandoned piano is seen inside of an abandoned apartment in the war-torn UN buffer zone in divided capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

The parade is part of festivities that underscore their sense of freedom and sovereignty.\n\nConversely, in southern Cyprus, the day is marked by solemn commemorations. Memorial services will be held across the region, including a significant event at the Presidential Palace in Nicosia, which will be attended by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. This is the first time a Greek Prime Minister has been present at such a ceremony, highlighting the gravity of the occasion.\n\nThe conflict dates back to 1974 when Turkey invaded Cyprus following a brief coup by the Greek military junta, which had overthrown the legitimate government of Cyprus. The invasion was justified by Turkey as a necessary intervention under its rights as a guarantor power, along with Greece and Britain, to restore constitutional order. The coup in Greece led to the collapse of its seven-year military dictatorship, but the Turkish invasion resulted in a lasting division of the island.\n\nSince then, Cyprus has remained divided, with a UN buffer zone separating the Turkish-controlled north from the internationally recognized south. Despite the restoration of constitutional order in Cyprus, Turkey has not withdrawn its troops, and Britain retains control over 3 percent of Cypriot territory as sovereign base areas.\n\nThe 50th anniversary serves as a stark reminder of the enduring impact of the invasion on Cyprus, with celebrations in the north contrasting sharply with the somber remembrance in the south.", "source": {"uri": "africanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Africanews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turkish invasion of Cyprus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Cypriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Greece", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Greece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Cyprus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Turkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_junta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greek junta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriakos_Mitsotakis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyriakos Mitsotakis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicosia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nicosia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Middle East", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/59/06/20/1024x538_cmsv2_51a804f2-d88b-5ef8-bb80-155e1919fc4b-8590620.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749516", "eventUri": "eng-9749516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

During his visit to Athens on Dec. 7, 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed a new era of rapprochement and a positive agenda between the two countries. The signing of the 15 declarations, agreements, and memoranda of cooperation, concerning a wide range of sectors including tourism, energy, trade, education, and transport presented an opportunity for a more constructive dialogue in Turkish-Greek relations.\n\nHaving said this, it is really interesting to witness over and over again that every time T\u00fcrkiye approaches Greece, the Greek side perceived this as an opportunity to impose their political will on the Turkish side. This is followed by a misperception as if the Turkish side will give a compromise to the Greek side on its red lines in the Aegean Sea, on the delimitation of the Eastern Mediterranean maritime jurisdiction areas, and in the Cyprus issue for the sake of improvement of T\u00fcrkiye-European Union membership process.\n\nArguably, once more it is this deception that stands behind Mitsotakis's recent visit to the island. Similarly, the illusion of the Greek Cypriot government that it is the sole legitimate authority of the island under the guise of the legally defunct \"Republic of Cyprus\" is the creator of the Cyprus problem and the guardian of its existence. Despite their limited demographic, military, and economic powers, the Greek sides followed an expansionist policy in the Eastern Mediterranean, trying to exclude TRNC and T\u00fcrkiye which has the longest seashore on the Eastern Mediterranean, from the regions political and hydrocarbon equilibrium.\n\nWhy is it important for Greece to cooperate with T\u00fcrkiye?\n\nThere have been critical developments in the region in recent years. The war in Ukraine and the tragedy in Gaza exacerbate new sources of conflict in this already volatile region. These conflicts also escalated irregular migration which constitutes one of the most significant contemporary security threats for Greece. Especially the war in Ukraine causes political and economic instability all over the world along with endangering the secure transfer of energy resources to Europe.\n\nGreece should cooperate with T\u00fcrkiye in solving many critical global and regional problems such as irregular migration, international terrorism, safe access to energy resources and so on. Additionally, as put forward by almost all the experts on the issue, the safest and most profitable way for hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern Mediterranean to reach the European market is to transport these sources via T\u00fcrkiye. In this respect, it is worth reminding that TRNC President Ersin Tatar proposed six constructive proposals for cooperation with the Greek side in July 2022 for the benefit of both nations living on the island. The proposals for cooperation include sharing of the hydrocarbon resources around the island, transition to green energy including the establishment of electricity interconnectivity of the island with the EU grid via T\u00fcrkiye, and optimizing the utilization of solar energy including investments throughout the island.\n\nFurthermore, Turkish President Erdogan proposed a regional East-Med conference on hydrocarbons to sort out the existing political and legal problems with the participation of all the coastal states and stakeholders including the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot side.\n\nIf the Greek side could get rid of the obsession of being the sole owner of the island and abandon its expansionist policy that aims to turn the Aegean Sea into a Greek lake, then there will be a win-win situation for all the stakeholders. Similarly, a fair, realistic, practical, and sustainable solution in Cyprus can only be reached through the existing realities on the island, namely the establishment of a structured cooperative relationship between the two sovereign states. TRNC President Tatar has declared many times that the Turkish side will not invest in a \"dead and buried\" federal solution model that has yielded no positive results in the past 60 years. This is also a state policy for T\u00fcrkiye and the Greek side has no power to impose its will on the Turkish side on this issue.\n\nTo sum up, Mitsotakis's visit to Southern Cyprus on July 20 is a fresh new example of the Greek side's lack of strategic vision on cooperation with T\u00fcrkiye and the realities on the island. In other words, Mitsotakis once more seems to misunderstand the importance of fostering a stable and cooperative relationship with T\u00fcrkiye. Turkish side's preference for diplomacy over unilateralism and dynamic foreign policy based on action will continue to provide the necessary answers to the Greek side that preferred to rely on rhetoric, help from the outside actors, and vicious circle diplomacy for many years.\n\n*Opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of

You know who is speaking. I am Makarios. The coup of the junta has failed. I was the junta's target, and as long as I am alive the junta will not succeed ... Put up resistance in every way. Don't be afraid.\"\n\nFifty years ago this month, Athens's military junta, a colonels' cabal bent on the union with Cyprus they called enosis, briefly believed that, after three failed attempts, they had finally assassinated Archbishop Makarios, Greek Cypriot president since 1960, when Britain granted Cyprus and its Turkish Cypriot minority independence.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Makarios, spiritual and political head of his people, was a firm supporter of both the enosis and the armed guerrillas who, until the British agreed on a formal ceasefire, fought under the acronym Eoka, which translates as National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters. But post-independence Greco-Turkish relations, between both Athens and Ankara and even more so in Cyprus itself, began to deteriorate.\n\nOne of the main problems was that memories of what had virtually been a civil war where the British recruited Turkish Cypriots and some Greek Cypriots firmly believed in their Athens-backed enosis dream, were too recent. Much to Makarios's disgust, an organisation calling itself Eoka B appeared. Kidnapping and murder became rife. The archbishop began to make it plain that Cyprus was too close to Turkey to make union with Greece anything more than a dangerous dream.\n\nThen his enemies tried to kill him. First in a car ambush, and when that failed, in an attempt to shoot down his helicopter that wounded his pilot. These failures only seemed to make his enemies more determined.\n\nIn July 1974, the Athens junta's chosen instrument was a close-quarters assault on the presidential palace by a squadron of elderly Russian tanks, originally a gift to Makarios from Soviet Russia. In the midsummer heat, their turncoat crews had used incendiary ammunition at almost point-blank range to start an all-consuming blaze. Rumours spread that, despite the rites of his church, Makarios had been carelessly cremated.\n\nInstead the smoke may well have saved his life by screening the back-door palace exit for His Beatitude and his bodyguards long enough to reach the car that delivered him to Paphos, the loyalist stronghold that was his birthplace. Here, while under sporadic artillery fire from a pirated patrol boat in junta hands, he had contemplated recruiting enough followers to make a stand but was persuaded by the Anglo-Americans not to push his luck. Instead a British helicopter delivered him to RAF Akrotiri - part of the 99 square miles Cyprus allowed Britain to keep after its independence - for a flight to London and then New York, and the podium that awaited him at the UN security council.\n\nIn Ankara, the scholarly Turkish prime minister B\u00fclent Ecevit, a former journalist and translator into Turkish of TS Eliot, had not long been in office and was anxious to show his conservative opposition that he took Turkish Cypriot security as seriously as they did. Ecevit warned the junta that unless they immediately climbed down and Cyprus reverted to the previous state of affairs, including restoration of Makarios, its military would intervene.\n\nOn 19 July, Athens responded by announcing that as a first step it was reopening Nicosia airport and allowing the international press in. On arrival, we were greeted by young Greek English-speaking national guardsmen in well-pressed shirts and shorts carrying old Thompson submachine guns. \"Welcome,\" beamed one. \"Now everything is all right. Now it is a Greek island.\"\n\nThere was a press \u00adconference hosted by Nikos Sampson, a \u00adformer 1950s anti-British pro-independence Eoka hitman whom, for want of anyone better, the junta appointed acting president. To say the least, Sampson had had a chequered career. During the last decade of British rule he had started out as a cub reporter for the Cyprus Times and left professional rivals marvelling at his ability to be first at the latest street shooting. Then the British colonial police twigged that he was moonlighting as at least a target spotter and probably something worse. On the run and arrested in possession of a firearm, a hanging offence, he was reprieved and had served 18 months of a life sentence in Wandsworth when he was freed under the 1959 Zurich agreement that preceded independence.\n\nApart from him, the other stars of his press conference were the newly released prisoners of the tactical police reserve, Makarios's Praetorian guard, with their tales of agonising interrogation. Some of their exhibits were worthy of the Spanish Inquisition, with the \u00adpossible exception of a battery-\u00adoperated rubber vibrator which a French female photographer had Sampson holding up for a photographic feeding frenzy until he realised what he was doing.\n\nWe departed for the Turkish side of the argument. Rauf Denktash, a London-trained lawyer, was the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and kept beneath his desk a spaniel that snapped at visiting feet. \"Just like Makarios, that dog,\" said Denktash. \"Snaps at his friends and doesn't recognise his enemies.\"\n\nDenktash operated from an office near what had become known as Nicosia's green lines (the name dated from the early 1960s, when, three years after independence and the start of intercommunal reciprocal slaughter, a British UN officer picked up his green marker and drew the lines on his map where it was hoped Greeks and Turks might learn to travel with impunity).\n\nThen, shouting his head off, one of Denktash's aides burst in. \"This is it!\" a triumphant Denktash translated. \"The BBC are reporting a Turkish armada heading for Cyprus. There couldn't be a better time for Turkey to come here. The whole world will be behind us. You better find yourselves a bed.\"\n\nThe five-storey Ledra Palace, the Levant's most famous hotel, where the exiled King Farouk once sipped brandy sours disguised as nothing more lethal than \u00adlemonade with a dash of angostura bitters, was only a few minutes' walk from the Venetian walls of Nicosia's old city. From behind the reception desk's polished mahogany, one of the under-managers, famously costumed in morning suit winter and summer, war and peace, examined us with obvious disdain.\n\nDidn't we realise several chartered Lebanese fishing boats from Beirut, heavy with our competitors, had berthed in Famagusta yesterday? But, providing we were prepared to share single rooms, he would see what he could do. Soon he was checking in what turned out to be the Ledra's last paying customers.\n\nSome of us not only shared rooms but also snoozed on the floor waiting for our turn on the teleprinter, if we had anything to say. After all, it might never happen. They might just cruise up and down Cyprus's northern coast for days on end until Athens and Ankara came to their senses and everybody went home.\n\nEven so, Cyprus had a \u00adsizeable Turkish Cypriot minority, and a Turkish coast only 40 miles away, much closer than Greece. And there was no bigger army than Turkey's in all of cold war Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ledra tried to keep up standards. A musical trio - electronic keyboard, bass and drums - set up a mic and two big speakers behind the tennis courts and swimming pool. The keyboard player, a Vietnam veteran, started by accompanying himself on that year's Paper Lace hit Billy Don't Be a Hero, which is based on an American civil war song. Drinks were served. After the concert, the hotel's management announced that a curfew had been imposed and we were not allowed to leave the hotel until further notice. It was a Friday, and somebody noticed that the Muslim calls for prayer seemed later than usual.\n\nThe first shots of Turkey's Operation Attila woke us shortly after daybreak, followed by the \u00adsurprising sight of Turkish \u00adparatroopers dropping from their circling transport aircraft to reinforce the Turkish Cypriot militia in the city's northern sector.\n\nAt the same time, we had our first brief taste of Turkish air support as their Skyhawks dived and climbed, leaving their calling cards of black smoke. It turned out that, in one instance, these fires were fuelled by a burning mental hospital mistaken for a nearby broadcasting station\n\nOvernight, some 20 Greek Cypriot national guard had established themselves on the Ledra's roof and built sandbagged nests for two belt-fed .50 Browning machine guns of a type usually installed in armoured vehicles. With the aid of binoculars, they began firing long bursts at suspected targets below them, barring entrance to a growing media audience when they realised its presence might give away their position.\n\nNonetheless, by 8am the Turks had located them, and with startling accuracy sent a single mortar bomb that killed one of the rooftop contingent, seriously wounded another and inflicted lighter injuries on several more.\n\nWith the hotel lifts uncertain, casualties and equipment were carried as gently as possible down the five flights of steps that led to the lobby ... and an international media crush. Cameras as big as bazookas awaited. Having their wounded turned into primetime viewing enraged the national guard, one of whom rolled about the floor with a drawn revolver until he was disarmed by his comrades. The two Brownings were set up in the area where the trio had given their surprise alfresco concert - their speakers were still there - and used on an area beyond the tennis courts where Turkish infantry had been spotted.\n\nWhile this was going on, the reputation of the press corps was somewhat redeemed by Donald Wise, a former British para officer and unlikely Daily Mirror reporter. Despite incoming fire, he drove the worst-hit man among the wounded from the Ledra rooftop to hospital in his hired Mini. The next day, a French-Canadian unit serving in the UN peacekeeping forceemptied the Ledra of armed elements and press alike as the hotel became part of the buffer zone the Canadians were trying to re-establish between combatants.\n\nThe fighting would drag on for almost a month, and casualty figures are extremely woolly. Even quite reliable sources cite between 4,500 and 6,000 Greek Cypriots killed, wounded or missing, believed dead. For the Turks - who, apart from close air support, had 180 contemporary tanks compared to the Greek side's rusting Stalingrad relics - it was between 1,500 to 3,800 dead. The refugee displacement was enormous: roughly 200,000 Greek Cypriots came south and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots went north.\n\nThe 1974 war in Cyprus lasted just under a month. It dragged on through innumerable broken ceasefires, Kissinger-sponsored Geneva peace talks and, almost in its last hours, a Turkish tank attack that captured Famagusta, its only deep-water port.\n\nIn just under a month, the poetical Ecevit had won the makings of a Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus that occupied just over a third of the island in the name of a Turkish Cypriot community not quite a fifth of its total population. It still does. The Ledra Palace, its glory days long over, has spent the last half-century in the buffer zone, serving as a barracks for British UN troops and a rendezvous for high-level negotiations that get nowhere.\n\nFor much of that time, quoting Lenin, some nearby graffiti declared: \"There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen.\" It appears Cyprus is still awaiting its decade.\n\nIn 1974, military historian Colin Smith was the Observer's chief roving correspondent, and was named international reporter of the year in the British press awards for, among other things, his coverage of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.\n\nGuardian", "source": {"uri": "parikiaki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Parikiaki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You've got the parachutes coming out of the big planes.And as a kid of 8 years old, you couldn't believe what was going on.\n\n\"My mother pretty much pulled us towards the tree that we could take refuge.\n\n\"The house right next to where I lived was bombed, just next door.\n\n\"It is a day very hard to forget.\"He said his family had to shelter with 40 others in a small, cramped basement for a day.\n\nTurkey seized control of the northern third of the island over the space of a month, causing the Greek Cypriots there to flee to the south.\n\nThousands of Greek Cypriots went missing as Turkey as prisoners of war and victims of the invasion.\n\nHomes once lived in by Greek Cypriots were eventually given away to migrating Turks and whole villages became abandoned.\n\nMy father decided there is no security, no future, so he takes us to the UK.\"John said: \"People don't know where their parents are, people don't know where their kids are... the worst bit is not knowing. I know guys whose families were raped during this.\"\n\nJohn said that his father's appliance store was broken into by Turkish soldiers and robbed.\n\nHis family, from north of Nicosia, then fled to the southern city of Larnaca where they stayed a year before moving to Britain.\n\nHe added: \"I'd give everything up to give Cyprus back.\n\n\"Having to go back, I've been there three times, I try to overcome it, but I can't its difficult.\n\nTo give back, I've worked with King Charles, Prince William, Queen Elizabeth, there is a lot of stuff I have done because of the gratitude, because the UK opened their arms when I came as a refugee.\n\n\"I know what it is like to leave your home and have nothing else.\n\n\"What made me the man I am today is going through the experience of a war and being insecure.\"\n\nJohn is able to go back to the places his family is from, but he says the island being divided remains difficult for him.\n\nImagine you've got a house you go back to that somebody has invaded, and you can't do anything about it.\n\n\"It's so depressing... It's just not fair.\"\n\nAs the businessman knows what it is like to be a refugee, he is now helping Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion of their country.\n\nHe offered around 1,000 refugees accommodation for a year after they fled to Britain.\n\nHe said: \"I want all the refugees to be able to go back to their properties without the presence of Turkish troops.\n\n\"You just have to find a way, like anything.\"\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus High Commissioner to London Dr Kyriacos Kouros said his country treated the 50th anniversary as a sad commemoration.\n\nHe said: \"Of course, it is awkward our Turkish Cypriot compatriots are doing the opposite, they are celebrating what transpired in that month.\n\nThe Sun", "source": {"uri": "parikiaki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Parikiaki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greek Cypriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Christodoulou", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Christodoulou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Land_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Land Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larnaca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larnaca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicosia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nicosia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Cypriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749516", "eventUri": "eng-9749516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

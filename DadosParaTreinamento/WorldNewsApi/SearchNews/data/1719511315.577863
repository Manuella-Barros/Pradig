The honorary president of the Reform UK party drew heavy criticism on Sunday after claiming Rishi Sunak had allowed \u201cmore people into the country who are going to fight British values\u201d than any UK leader before him. Speaking on Sky News\u2019 Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, the former Ukip leader said: \u201cWe have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values, [who] in fact loathe much of what we stand for.\u201d When asked if he was talking about Muslims, Farage responded, \u201cWe are. \u2026 And I\u2019m afraid I found some of the recent surveys saying that 46% of British Muslims support Hamas \u2013 support a terrorist organisation that is proscribed in this country.\u201d Plaid Cymru and Momentum, Labour\u2019s grassroots campaign group, described his comments as an example of \u201coutright Islamophobia\u201d. Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, said: \u201cNigel Farage should not be allowed to spout Islamophobia and hatred on our television screens. He is an extremist who has been allowed to corrode our politics for far too long. \u201cPlaid Cymru reaffirms our commitment to eradicating all forms of Islamophobia, antisemitism, racism, and intolerance. We encourage all parties in this election to campaign on policy and ideas, not on fears and prejudices.\u201d The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper MP, said: \u201cThis a grubby attempt to divide our communities in a desperate attempt for attention. It\u2019s no surprise Nigel Farage has lost at the ballot box seven times over. \u201cRishi Sunak must condemn these divisive comments and rule out Farage rejoining the Conservative party.\u201d Zara Mohammed, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said Farage was doing what he did best, expressing \u201chorribly Islamophobic, racist and hate-filled rhetoric of misinformation\u201d. In the same interview, Farage said he still had \u201cone more big card to play\u201d and confirmed that he plans to stand as an MP candidate in the future, despite feeling \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d at Sunak\u2019s decision to call a snap election on 4 July. He made it clear that the Reform party would be centring its campaign on their bid to reduce immigration. Farage went on to compare how much more integrated people who had come from the West Indies were in British society than Muslims, claiming the former group had \u201cshared history, shared culture and shared religion\u201d in many cases. He agreed that most of the West Indian community spoke English, but added: \u201cI can take you to streets in Oldham where literally no one speaks English.\u201d A Labour source said the Conservatives and the Reform party were \u201ctwo sides of the same broken coin, ramping up the rhetoric without offering any real solutions\u201d. Farage stood as a candidate for the UK Independence Party (Ukip) at five previous general elections and two byelections. His most recent campaign was in the South Thanet constituency in 2015, where he picked up more than 16,000 votes. Reflecting on his decision not to stand at this election, Farage told GB News: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen I want to be part of the national debate, not just in a constituency, and I will be that, and believe you me, I\u2019m going to do my best to expose some of the absolute nonsense that are being discussed over immigration and economics.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Comments from former Ukip leader, who also said he will stand for parliament in the future, described as \u2018outright Islamophobia\u2019</p><p>Nigel Farage has come under fire for using his first election interview to \u201cspout Islamophobia, hatred and divisive comments\u201d after he said a growing number of Muslims do not share British values.</p><p>The honorary president of the Reform UK party drew heavy criticism on Sunday after claiming Rishi Sunak had allowed \u201cmore people into the country who are going to fight British values\u201d than any UK leader before him.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/26/nigel-farage-under-fire-said-muslims-not-share-british-values\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/26/nigel-farage-under-fire-said-muslims-not-share-british-values", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f49c6bee4832009a5d3deef73f1ecd86a784fd/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:48:33", "author": "Aletha Adu", "authors": ["Aletha Adu"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.047}

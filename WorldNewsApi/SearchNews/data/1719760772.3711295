{"id": 225092518, "title": "Tom Bombadil Finally Steps Forth in \u2018The Rings of Power\u2019\u2014An Exclusive First Look", "text": "The Rings of Power, the Amazon Prime Video series based on Tolkien\u2019s ancient history of his fantasy realm, will break that tradition of exclusion and finally feature Tom Bombadil\u2014along with his jolly songs and his flamboyant wardrobe\u2014when its second season begins August 29. Bombadil was described in Tolkien\u2019s books as \u201colder than the old,\u201d a benevolent entity who began life around the time all life began, so his existence in this earlier era, thousands of years before the events of The Lord of the Rings, fits within the canon established by the author. In a 1937 letter to his publisher, mulling a possible sequel to The Hobbit, Tolkien described Bombadil as \u201cthe spirit of the (vanishing) Oxford and Berkshire countryside.\u201d The author bristled at the notion that he wrote in allegory, but it\u2019s clear he saw Bombadil as nature personified\u2014right up to the character\u2019s ambivalence about interfering in the larger world around him. That left showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay to figure out exactly how he might turn up in their show\u2014and why. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why he hasn\u2019t been in prior adaptations, because in some ways he\u2019s sort of an anti-dramatic character,\u201d Payne tells Vanity Fair for this exclusive first look. \u201cHe\u2019s not a character who has a particularly strong agenda. He observes drama, but largely doesn\u2019t participate in it. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the characters kind of just go there and hang out for a while, and Tom drops some knowledge on them.\u201d Adds McKay: \u201cKnowledge that\u2019s not particularly relevant to anything that they\u2019re doing or about to do.\u201d Bombadil first turns up when the hobbits run afoul of Old Man Willow, an angry tree in the Old Forest who swallows Merry and Pippin in the folds of his bark. Bombadil sings a song that soothes the savage sprout, causing it to release the halflings. After a brief stay with him and his wife, Goldberry, the little ones depart. Later, they\u2019re rescued again by Bombadil when they are captured by malevolent spirits known as Barrow-wights, who seize them in an ancient cemetery. (\u201cBarrow\u201d is an Old English word for burial mound, and \u201cwight\u201d is a kind of a ghost.) \u201cHe can be a force for good, but he is challenging to integrate dramatically in that he doesn't have an agenda. He\u2019s not driving forward and pushing people to arrive at any particular end,\u201d Payne says. Tolkien himself was hazy about the character\u2019s purpose, and said he kept Bombadil in the story even though he didn\u2019t have a clear purpose plotwise. \u201cTom Bombadil is not an important person\u2014to the narrative,\u201d Tolkien wrote in a 1954 letter to his proofreader for The Lord of the Rings. \u201cI suppose he has some importance as a \u2018comment.\u2019 I mean, I do not really write like that.\u2026 He represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely.\u201d One reader of the books suggested that Tom Bombadil was a stand-in for God himself, prompting Tolkien to reply in another 1954 letter: \u201cI really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point.\u201d Above all, Tolkien was determined not to overthink Old Tom. Tolkien offered a few clues in the 1954 letter to his proofreader, explaining why Bombadil chooses to break his neutrality and help the hobbits. \u201cThe story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power,\u201d Tolkien wrote. To someone like Bombadil, he said, \u201cthe question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless.\u201d Tolkien described Bombadil as \u201ca natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war.\u201d But also, he believed the character would tip the scale of fate in favor of the hobbits and their fellowship as they stood against the forces of evil rising in the eastern portion of Middle-earth. \u201cUltimately only the victory of the West will allow Bombadil to continue, or even to survive. Nothing would be left for him in the world of Sauron,\u201d Tolkien wrote. This was the key for The Rings of Power showrunners. \u201cWe started thinking, What does he care about? And how can that be a doorway to drama?\u201d Payne says. \u201cWe know he cares about the natural world. And we know he is a helper. He\u2019s not going to push you, but he will help you. And so, traditionally, he lives in this place called the Withywindle, which is this sort of almost enchanted forest.\u201d For the series, Payne and McKay took the liberty of giving Bombadil a second home, on the outskirts of a region called Rh\u00fbn. \u201cIn our story, he has gone out to the lands of Rh\u00fbn, which we learn used to be sort of Edenic and green and beautiful, but now is sort of a dead wasteland,\u201d Payne says. \u201cTom has gone out there to see what\u2019s happened as he goes on his various wanderings.\u201d That\u2019s the same place where the second season of The Rings of Power finds the halflings Nori (Markella Kavenagh) and Poppy (Megan Richards) as they escort the amnesiac wizard known as the Stranger (Daniel Weyman) toward discovering his purpose. At the end of the first season, the Stranger gave off some major Gandalf signifiers, using terminology that is particular to the wise old sorcerer played by Ian McKellen in the Jackson films. Expect Tom Bombadil to offer the Stranger some rare compassion in this otherwise merciless place. As Payne explains: \u201cWhen he finally crosses paths with the Stranger, you could say he has a desire to try to keep the destruction that has happened there from spreading to his beloved lands in the West. He nudges the Stranger along his journey, which he knows will eventually protect the larger natural world that he cares about. So I\u2019d say our Tom Bombadil is slightly more interventionist than you see in the books, but only by 5% or 10%.\u201d In fact, he was a Lord of the Rings novice before signing on to The Rings of Power. \u201cThere are people who knew it from the books, people who knew it from the films, and there are those who had managed to get to 46 without knowing that much about it at all,\u201d the actor says. When Kinnear was offered the part, he says, \u201cI was honest\u2014I hadn\u2019t read it. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll go away and read it and get back to you.\u2019 And I went downstairs to my partner, who did know the books, and does know the films, and I said, \u2018I\u2019ve been offered this part. Apparently it\u2019s in the books. A guy called Tom Bombadil.\u2019 She was like, \u2018No way! You\u2019re not playing Tom Bombadil!\u2019 So I sort of knew instantly then that it had a cultural heft to it that I was going to have to be sensitive to.\u201d Kinnear makes clear that his partner, fellow Penny Dreadful actor Pandora Colin, was simply surprised to hear that the show would feature Tom Bombadil\u2014she wasn\u2019t disputing his casting. \u201cNo, she was excited. That was her excited face,\u201d Kinnear says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe that.\u2019 Her words were, \u2018He\u2019s my favorite character in all of the books.\u2019\u201d As perplexing as Bombadil may be, even to his creator, this quirk is also part of his charm. Readers of The Lord of the Rings have been pining for a Bombadil screen appearance for years, prompting Jackson to explain that he left the character out precisely because he interrupts the story\u2019s central quest. \u201cWhat we did contemplate, and it was really for the fans, was to have the hobbits walking through the Old Forest and to see a feathered cap come darting through the trees, to hear the sound of Tom Bombadil\u2019s voice and song and then have the hobbits turn and run away as fast as they could!\u201d Jackson said in a December 2001 issue of Cinefantastique. \u201cWe thought [that] would acknowledge Tom Bombadil in an affectionate-joke kind of way. We didn\u2019t have time to do it.\" Absence has only made the heart of the Lord of the Rings fandom grow fonder for Old Tom. In addition to his prominent role in the new season of The Rings of Power, HarperCollins is publishing a new edition of Tolkien\u2019s 1962 book The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, featuring his poems about the ethereal figure\u2014some of which date back to long before his epic trilogy. The book, set to hit shelves August 20, is aimed at the enduring fascination Tolkien readers have for this enigmatic fantasy figure. Even Tolkien himself was transfixed. \u201cHe has his origins in the name of a wooden doll that lived in the Tolkien family, and like many of the toys owned by the children, such as the teddy bears who appeared in Mr. Bliss, or the metal dog that inspired the hero of Roverandom, Tom Bombadil was drawn into Tolkien\u2019s invented world,\u201d Chris Smith, the publishing director for the company\u2019s Tolkien titles, tells Vanity Fair. \u201cHis first known appearance was in the 1920s, in a story entitled \u2018Tom Bombadil,\u2019 and even in this fragment\u2014which is included in the new edition of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\u2014he is described as one of \u2018the oldest inhabitants in the kingdom,\u2019 suggesting that from the outset Tolkien viewed Tom as primordial. Later, in the early 1930s, Tolkien put him into a poem.\u201d That early poem was the beginning of a long fascination with the character. Tolkien\u2019s full verse for \u201cThe Adventures of Tom Bombadil\u201d was published in 1934 in The Oxford Magazine, and led him to wonder if this woodland being might be a good protagonist for future stories. Ultimately, Bombadil would remain a supporting player for the Lord of the Rings saga, with Tolkien determined not to explore his full nature too thoroughly. \u201cHaving lived for millennia, he has learned and understood its deeper mysteries and perhaps this is why he has now become \u2018Master,\u2019 as he is called by himself and his wife, Goldberry, and why he is free from any control by the outside world,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHis is a pure and unaffected joy in the living things of the world, very much removed from the oppressive menace of the overarching tale of the quest of the Ring. Perhaps Tolkien intended Tom to remain forever a light in the darkness of troubled times? But ultimately, he must remain a delightful enigma.\u201d \u201cI was really interested to see how they were then going to process the character through the prism of their eyes and the way that they see the show developing,\u201d Kinnear says. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense of huge experience, huge openness, huge empathy, and having gone through so much that he knows it\u2019s the small things that are important. That felt actually quite domestic, felt quite reachable in terms of my understanding of who he was.\u201d Tolkien himself laid out the look of the character, writing in chapter six of The Lord of the Rings: \u201cSuddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, stumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging through the grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat and long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter.\u201d \u201cHis boots are yellow, the jacket is blue, and he\u2019s got a feather in his hat, so all the main beats were hit,\u201d Kinnear says, comparing Bombadil\u2019s flamboyant style to the way a child dresses. \u201cMy daughter is 10, and for a year and a half she wore a sheep hat throughout the school day and through the hottest, hottest summer. It was just the face of a sheep with big, long woolly straps around the side. I mean\u2014absolutely ridiculous. Too small for her as well. But I could not get it off her. There you are. She didn\u2019t care. We can take something from that attitude, I think, as adults.\u201d The other major inspiration for his Tom Bombadil came not from the freshness of childhood but from the permanence of extreme age\u2014more geological than biological. \u201cThe big thing was, how\u2019s he going to talk? There are lots of different dialects and accents going on throughout the show, and I wanted him to be somewhat distinct from those,\u201d Kinnear says. \u201cBut I also wanted to choose an accent that felt old\u2014that was British, but felt like the oldest part of Britain.\u201d The notion hit him while swimming off the coast of Cornwall in the westernmost tip of southern England. \u201cThe rock in Cornwall just sort of erupts out of the sea, and you can see all the layers of accretion. I was looking at it and just thinking, God, this has been here for so long. It\u2019s a bit like standing on Table Mountain [overlooking Cape Town in South Africa] and you think, This mountain has seen everything, has seen this silly little city develop from this tiny little speck. It must feel so young to this mountain, this tiny little city, now a fantastic city,\u201d Kinnear says. \u201cI remember looking up at these rocks and thinking, The things that it\u2019s seen, the sailors that have passed by. When I was thinking of the oldest part of Britain, that was where I naturally found myself being led. So I worked with Leith [McPherson], the dialect coach, on getting a Cornish accent together. Those were the big building blocks of the character.\u201d As season two of The Rings of Power gets underway, Tom Bombadil offers aid and comfort not just to the Stranger, but also to the audience. \u201cSeason one set the pieces on the chessboard, and in season two the pieces are in motion and it\u2019s really about the villains,\u201d Payne says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Sauron, who is not cloaked behind the guise of [the human refugee] Halbrand anymore. The audience knows he\u2019s Sauron, so now we\u2019re watching him maneuver as he\u2019s manipulating [the burn-scar covered dark elf] Adar, who\u2019s another big villain of the season.\u2026 Really, Tom is sort of a curiosity within that structure because while it is darker, Tom Bombadil is singing and saying lines that could be nursery rhymes from children\u2019s poems. So he sort of defies the tonal shift of the rest of the season and is a real point of light amidst an otherwise sea of darkness.\u201d Tom Bombadil brings this levity while remaining somewhat in the shadows himself. Payne and McKay have decided not to answer any questions about the character that Tolkien himself left deliberately unresolved. As Smith puts it: \u201cPerhaps the only answer to the enigma that is Tom Bombadil is simply to accept that, as Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings, \u2018He is.\u2019\u201d", "summary": "J.R.R.

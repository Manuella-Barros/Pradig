{"id": 232004772, "title": "BJP\u2019s Pick for Modi 3.0 from Kerala", "text": "Thiruvananthapuram: The BJP's selection of nominees Suresh Gopi and George Kurian for Narendra Modi's 3.0 Cabinet from Kerala suggests that the party is focused on broadening its support in the state besides consolidating its recent electoral victories, with an eye on the upcoming local bodies and assembly elections in less than two years.Suresh Gopi made history by winning the BJP's first-ever Lok Sabha seat in Kerala from Thrissur. It is expected that he will be given a key portfolio in the Cabinet and will serve as the party's face in Kerala.Many believe his prior experience as a Rajya Sabha member and his popularity as a Malayalam film superstar make him a leader who resonates with people across different identities, including caste, creed, community, and religion. His victory in Thrissur was a clear example of his growing acceptance among the electorate, which he attained despite facing numerous adversities and trolls.\"Suresh Gopi's strong bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to help him effectively champion Kerala's development projects. With the BJP's vote share increasing from 13 percent to 16.68 percent, and the NDA's from 15.64 percent to 19.23 percent, the new ministers will have a solid foundation in the state to advance the national leadership's agenda for Kerala.\"The BJP will aim to capitalize on the progress it made in the Lok Sabha elections. In as many as 11 assembly segments spanning three Lok Sabha seats \u2013 Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, and Attingal \u2013 the BJP outperformed the ruling CPM-led LDF and the opposition Congress-led UDF to secure victory. Furthermore, certain constituencies witnessed a significant surge in vote share, including the traditionally CPM-stronghold areas of Alappuzha and Alathur, both experiencing an 11% increase. The significant increase in BJP's vote share in Alappuzha, Thrissur, and Attingal also indicates that the party has succeeded in making inroads in the OBC Ezhava community.One of the factors that has helped the BJP gain a foothold among Ezhavas, who are traditionally Left supporters, is the presence of Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) in the NDA.Christian outreach to be scaled up During the recent Lok Sabha polls, the BJP experienced success in reaching out to Christians. The party asserts that a significant number of Christians voted for the NDA, particularly in Thrissur. This indicates that the BJP and Sangh Parivar are no longer considered political outcasts.The induction of George Kurian into the Union ministry will certainly help the BJP in making further inroads into the Christian community. Kurian, a former vice chairman of the National Minorities Commission, enjoys good relations with Church leaders belonging to different Christian denominations. His presence will help in strengthening the links with the community.It's worth noting that the BJP's accusation of minority appeasement against the LDF had gained traction among a section of Hindus and Christians. Before the elections, the LDF, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, launched a statewide campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), accusing the Centre of portraying Muslims as criminals. The Congress-led UDF also held similar campaigns.Political analysts believe that the excessive focus on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) by the two main political parties may have prompted some Hindus and Christians to lend their support to the BJP in specific regions. The BJP is working to gain the support of these groups ahead of the upcoming panchayat elections scheduled for next year.", "summary": "Party eyes rapid expansion of electoral base, consolidation of Lok Sabha poll gains", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/kerala/bjps-pick-for-modi-30-from-kerala-898120", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/09/1095928-gpogyvmakae1w67.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:25:15", "author": "Gilvester Assary", "authors": ["Gilvester Assary"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.545}

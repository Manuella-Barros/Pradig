'Namaskar Africa' in Ghana focuses on the West Africa regional bloc,\" Mr Sen said, adding Ghana is the focus country with participation expected from neighbouring countries like Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra-Leone and Togo.\n\nVice President Bawumia recalled the historic relationship between Ghana and India, and urged members of the delegation to take advantage of the pro-business agenda of the 7-month-old Nana Akufo-Addo government.\n\n\"As we have stated from the very beginning, our government is pursuing an agenda of economic transformation based on strong private sector participation and anchored on sound economic fundamentals,\" Dr Bawumia said, adding \"there is space and opportunity for cooperation between Ghanaian and Indian businesses.\n\n\"I will urge you to explore the many opportunities available in Ghana. I'm sure members of the AGI and GNCCI will be ready to sit down with you and agree on mutually beneficial arrangements.\"\n\nThe Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry is an association of business organisations in India.

'Ghana is blessed with a lot of riches in the form of mineral resources but the challenge is how to turn these riches into wealth for the benefit of the people.'\n\nNana Dr Appiagyei Dankawoso, the President of the Ghana Chamber of Commerce and Industry, on his part, urged the Indian and other investors to take advantage of the investment opportunities in Ghana, including infrastructure, real estate development, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, agriculture and agro-processing.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the forum would serve as a unique platform for businessmen and women from Ghana, India and other countries to share ideas and establish business relationships.\n\nMr Humphrey Ayim-Darke, the Vice President, Association of Ghana Industries, urged the Government to continue to engage the Association as industry players to help shape the business environment to attract investment.\n\nHe said more of such forums needed to be organised to provide useful research and investor-information for effective networking to enhance trade.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "type": "loc", "id": "81"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Accra"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accra"}, "type": "loc", "id": "74614"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "302660"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303539"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304013", "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310991", "label": {"eng": "Industrialisation"}}]}

Corruption has become the bane of our nation's progress. The Office of Special Prosecutor, which will be enacted in the next session of Parliament, will work independently of the Executive, and will have the responsibility to investigate and prosecute acts of corruption, free from predictable claims of witch-hunting.

We have had rule by law, without rule of law. We have lived in a society which did not institutionalise a culture of aspirations and opportunities. This history led to an apparent weakening of the sense of self-confidence amongst our people\".\n\n\"Nonetheless, what our long, tortured history has taught us is that the spirit of the Ghanaian, in his or her quest for peace, progress and prosperity, cannot be quenched. We are a determined lot who cannot be deterred. We have had our failures as a nation. But failure is never fatal so long as our courage to persevere prevails. We have seen how important it is to have a society that respects human rights,\" he said.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo said the country was currently enjoying its longest, sustained period of democracy because earlier generations willed it, fought for it and risked their lives for it.\n\n\"They had a mind and a heart attuned to sacrifice.

He quoted Zechariah, saying it was \"'not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of Hosts.'\"\n\nAdmission\n\n\"I cannot claim to be a biblical scholar, but my own, little understanding of the entirety of Isaiah Chapter 52, from whence the theme came, is that it borders on the subject of the deliverance of the Jews from captivity in Babylon. The encouragement given to them, from verses one to six, was for them to hope that God would deliver them from Babylon in his own way and time, assuring that there would be great joy and rejoicing on the day of deliverance,\" he noted.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo said, \"We in Ghana have also had our 'captivity in Babylon' moments. We have had to overcome several trials and tribulations: slavery, imperialism, colonialism, tyranny and dictatorship. We have held elections that were questionable. We have had rule by law, without rule of law. We have lived in a society which did not institutionalise a culture of aspirations and opportunities. This history led to an apparent weakening of the sense of self-confidence amongst our people.\"\n\nNonetheless, he indicate, \"What our long, tortuous history has taught us is that the spirit of the Ghanaian, in his or her quest for peace, progress and prosperity, cannot be quenched.\"\n\nIn view of that, he underscored, \"We are a determined lot who cannot be deterred. We have had our failures as a nation. But failure is never fatal so long as our courage to persevere prevails. We have seen how important it is to have a society that respects human rights.\"\n\nCharge\n\n\"In all of your work and advocacy, I urge you respectfully to be at the forefront of championing our efforts at believing in our nation's capacity to build a modern, developed, progressive society, and free ourselves from a mindset of dependence, aid, charity and handouts,\" he charged, saying, \"With your help, we will build a new Ghanaian civilization, where there is fair opportunity for all in education and health, where hard work, enterprise and creativity are rewarded, where there is an abundance of decent jobs with good pay, where there is a dignified retirement for the elderly, and where there is a social safety net for the vulnerable and disadvantaged.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Together, let us also promote a spirit of reconciliation amongst all of us for the sake of our beloved Ghana and Africa, her progress and prosperity.\n\n\"Speak out against decadence in our country and on our continent. If we think that moral issues are decided by the times we live in, then we have been blinded to the truth. The Second Book of Corinthians Chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 tell us that 'But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.'\"\n\nBelief\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo said he was very hopeful that the Almighty would give Ghana the necessary strength, compassion, humility and wisdom to chart a course that will draw the nation and continent closer to Him.\n\n\"Finally, my friends, colleagues and compatriots, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praise worthy, meditate on these things,\" the president charged.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 100, "id": 285, "label": "dmoz/Society/History"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "type": "loc", "id": "81"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302584", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303325", "label": {"eng": "Culture"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303539"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303653", "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304273", "label": {"eng": "Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304279", "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304283", "label": {"eng": "Christian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305970", "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306352", "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308370", "label": {"eng": "Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309151", "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309898", "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309972", "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317071", "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "328536", "label": {"eng": "Babylon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340527", "label": {"eng": "Imperialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "375299", "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "387425", "label": {"eng": "Babylonian captivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ghana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "428161", "label": {"eng": "President of Ghana"}}]}

Akbar said at the opening of a two-day \"Namaskar Africa 2017\" India-West Africa Trade and Exhibition Forum here Ghana.\n\nIndia has a different approach in its developmental relationship with other countries as it believes in sharing knowledge without any hidden agenda, Minister of State for External Affairs M.J. Akbar said at the opening of a two-day \"Namaskar Africa 2017\" India-West Africa Trade and Exhibition Forum here Ghana. \"Our attitude to knowledge is its powerful meaning -- that it is the only thing that grows when you give it away. We are ready to share with our friends, ready to be partners and ready to be equals and not come bearing gifts loaded with debt traps. We don't have any concept of debt traps,\" Akbar said at the event. The event, organised jointly by the Indian Commerce Ministry and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) aims to brand India a leading economic player and partner to the West African region. IT will help facilitate Indian investments into Ghana and neighbouring West African countries, create awareness about the best Indian technologies and products in the region as well as explore opportunities offered by the region. \"Namaskar Africa\" started with an India-Central Africa Regional Business Forum in Republic of Congo. Akbar drew a parallel between the leaders of India and Ghana in their quest to bring development to their countries. \"Both leaders stand for a conviction of a new vision which is not open-ended in terms of time,\" he said. \"In India, Prime Minister Modi is talking about five years whilst in Ghana President Akufo-Addo is talking about four years\", Akbar said, adding that the two leaders have adopted the use of transformation which means that they do not only have \"a vision but a route map to a new horizon\". Akbar said that the era purchases must be replaced by era of production. \"This era of production must be India and Ghana led.\"\n\nHe also expressed concern that in terms of trade, the developing world has, through the years, created the industry and \"someone else took the profit\". \"The time has come to reverse that. We must not allow our industry to become someone's profit. Profits must go to the people not kept by the companies. \"Growth by itself is no longer sustainable. The first fruits and largest share of growth must go to the people who live at the bottom of the growth pyramid,\" Akbar added. The minister said that the developing world has lost its voice when it comes to industry and trade. \"The Portuguese did not come to India because of tourism, they came because of India's silk\", and it was therefore time that countries in the South took back their brands. Akbar said that in 1948 over half of the British government's annual revenue came from the taxes on rubber in Malaysia and described this as \"the rape of massive exploitation and massive theft\".\n\nGhana's Trade and Industry Minister, Alan Kyerematen, said he had a soft spot for India because his \"godfather was a successful Indian merchant\". He said Ghana's President has launched a 10-point ambitious industrial transformation agenda to bring industrialisation to the door steps of the people. \"The government and the private sector will work together to bring one industry to one district,\" Kyerematen said. He invited investors from India to be part of the agenda. These industries include agro-based ventures. In addition, there are also plans for industrial parks in 10 regions.

establishment of friendly diplomatic relations between Ghana and India.\n\nPresently, trade balance between Ghana and India was in favour of Ghana, as Ghana took advantage of certain key investment policies to expand its exports to India, he said.\n\n\"We expect the fair to strengthen people-to-people relationships, bonds between the two countries and business relationships that are capable of generating employment for Ghanaians,\" Mr Singh added.\n\nPriority engagement\n\nThe High Commissioner noted that trade between India and West Africa had become a platform for job creation.\n\nIndia, he said, was the first country to offer a duty free tariff preference scheme to African goods and exportable commodities in 2008.\n\nUnder the scheme, he said, more than 98 per cent of tariff lines were opened to exports from Africa at low tariff, which provided a huge access to India's domestic market.\n\n\"We have been encouraging the 34 least developed countries in Africa to make better use of the duty free scheme to consolidate developmental gains in their countries,\" the High Commissioner stressed.\n\nOn Ghana, he said whereas Indian exports to Ghana were to the tune of $682 million as of 2016, Ghana's exports to India were to the tune of $1.93 billion.\n\nMr Singh said India was the second largest foreign investor in Ghana in terms of the number of projects, covering educational institutions, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, agro processing, among others.\n\nAsked about the possibility of Ghanaian businesses operating in India, considering the growing number of Indian businesses in Ghana, Mr Singh said his country would be happy to receive investments from Ghanaians, since India had a liberal investment policy that allowed profit repatriation.\n\nWriter's email:

If we think that moral issues are decided by the times we live in, then we have been blinded to the truth. The Second Book of Corinthians Chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 tell us that 'But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.'\"\n\nBelief\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo said he was very hopeful that the Almighty would give Ghana the necessary strength, compassion, humility and wisdom to chart a course that will draw the nation and continent closer to Him.\n\n\"Finally, my friends, colleagues and compatriots, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praise worthy, meditate on these things,\" the president charged.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 100, "id": 285, "label": "dmoz/Society/History"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "type": "loc", "id": "81"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302584", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303325", "label": {"eng": "Culture"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303539"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303653", "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304273", "label": {"eng": "Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304279", "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304283", "label": {"eng": "Christian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305970", "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306352", "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308370", "label": {"eng": "Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309151", "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309898", "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309972", "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317071", "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "328536", "label": {"eng": "Babylon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340527", "label": {"eng": "Imperialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "375299", "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "387425", "label": {"eng": "Babylonian captivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ghana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "428161", "label": {"eng": "President of Ghana"}}]}

Akbar said at the opening of a two-day \"Namaskar Africa 2017\" India-West Africa Trade and Exhibition Forum here Ghana.\n\n\"Our attitude to knowledge is its powerful meaning -- that it is the only thing that grows when you give it away. We are ready to share with our friends, ready to be partners and ready to be equals and not come bearing gifts loaded with debt traps. We don't have any concept of debt traps,\" Akbar said at the event.\n\nThe event, organised jointly by the Indian Commerce Ministry and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) aims to brand India a leading economic player and partner to the West African region.\n\nIT will help facilitate Indian investments into Ghana and neighbouring West African countries, create awareness about the best Indian technologies and products in the region as well as explore opportunities offered by the region.\n\n\"Namaskar Africa\" started with an India-Central Africa Regional Business Forum in Republic of Congo.\n\nAkbar drew a parallel between the leaders of India and Ghana in their quest to bring development to their countries. \"Both leaders stand for a conviction of a new vision which is not open-ended in terms of time,\" he said.\n\n\"In India, Prime Minister Modi is talking about five years whilst in Ghana President Akufo-Addo is talking about four years\", Akbar said, adding that the two leaders have adopted the use of transformation which means that they do not only have \"a vision but a route map to a new horizon\".\n\nAkbar said that the era purchases must be replaced by era of production. \"This era of production must be India and Ghana led.\"\n\nHe also expressed concern that in terms of trade, the developing world has, through the years, created the industry and \"someone else took the profit\".\n\n\"The time has come to reverse that. We must not allow our industry to become someone's profit. Profits must go to the people not kept by the companies.\n\n\"Growth by itself is no longer sustainable. The first fruits and largest share of growth must go to the people who live at the bottom of the growth pyramid,\" Akbar added.\n\nThe minister said that the developing world has lost its voice when it comes to industry and trade. \"The Portuguese did not come to India because of tourism, they came because of India's silk\", and it was therefore time that countries in the South took back their brands.\n\nAkbar said that in 1948 over half of the British government's annual revenue came from the taxes on rubber in Malaysia and described this as \"the rape of massive exploitation and massive theft\".\n\nGhana's Trade and Industry Minister, Alan Kyerematen, said he had a soft spot for India because his \"godfather was a successful Indian merchant\".\n\nHe said Ghana's President has launched a 10-point ambitious industrial transformation agenda to bring industrialisation to the door steps of the people.\n\n\"The government and the private sector will work together to bring one industry to one district,\" Kyerematen said. He invited investors from India to be part of the agenda.\n\nThese industries include agro-based ventures. In addition, there are also plans for industrial parks in 10 regions. In addition, there are also plans for a pharma park, petro-chemical industry and an integrated aluminium industry.\n\n(Francis Kokutse can be contacted at fkokutse@gmail.com)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "type": "loc", "id": "81"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "158"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "302660"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303410", "label": {"eng": "Trade"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303539"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "316915", "label": {"eng": "Akbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324362", "label": {"eng": "Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "333920", "label": {"eng": "Central Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._J._Akbar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "390752", "label": {"eng": "M.

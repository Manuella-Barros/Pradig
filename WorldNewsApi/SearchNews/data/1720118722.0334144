On Sunday, the actor shared a new poster of his upcoming film Ilaiyaraaja on X (formerly Twitter). The project is based on the life of the legendary musician Isaignani Ilaiyaraaja. The poster was shared to mark Ilaiyaraaja's birthday. It also features the text, \u201cHappy Birthday, Maestro.\u201d In the animated poster, the protagonist is looking at a sea of fans with his back facing the camera. We can also spot a harmonium and drums. We can also see some red flags and drums on the stage. Ilaiyaraaja turns 81 today. In the caption, Dhanush tagged the icon and wrote, \u201cHappy birthday to the one and only Isaignani Ilaiyaraaja sir.\u201d Happy birthday to the one and only @ilaiyaraaja sir. pic.twitter.com/adYPIqjc5s\u2014 Dhanush (@dhanushkraja) June 2, 2024 The legendary musician and composer Isaignani Ilaiyaraaja has a career spanning over 50 years, with more than 7,000 songs composed by him. He has also received the Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, and Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for his contributions to the industry. Veteran Kamal Haasan has also wished Ilaiyaraaja through a special post. He shared two pictures on X (formerly Twitter) - one with Ilaiyaraaja and another with ace director Mani Ratnam. FYI: Both of them share their birthdays. In the caption, he wrote (English translation), \u201cDouble happiness is a strange phrase in Tamil. Can happiness be measured? But today is like an example for me. This is a happy moment as today is the birthday of the elder brother among the three brothers and the birthday of the younger brother.\u201d \"My beloved brother Ilayaraja will tell the story in music; Anbuth Thambi Maniratnam who adds a touch of charm to screenwriting... I wish you both a happy birthday. May the legacy of our trio continue forever,\u201d Kamal Haasan added. \u0b87\u0bb0\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0bb7\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b92\u0bb0\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba9 \u0b9a\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bca\u0b9f\u0bb0\u0bcd. \u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0bb7\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b85\u0bb3\u0bb5\u0bc0\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9? \u0b86\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b93\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b89\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bcb\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc8\u0baf \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1.\u0bae\u0bc2\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0b9a\u0b95\u0bcb\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b85\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd, \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb1 \u0bae\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0ba9 \u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b87\u0ba4\u0bc1.\u0b87\u0b9a\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u2026 pic.twitter.com/CkN1tCQ6Ey\u2014 Kamal Haasan (@ikamalhaasan) June 2, 2024 Dhanush's Ilaiyaraaja will be jointly produced by Sriram Bakthisaran, CK Padma Kumar, Varun Mathur, Ilamparithy Gajendran and Saurabh Mishra.

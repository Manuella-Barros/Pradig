Since then, forecasting tropical cyclones and their impacts has improved thanks to advancements in technology and research. \u201cCommunicating the threats \u2013 especially here in east central Florida as it relates to the tracks of Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan in the Panhandle \u2013 back then we just didn\u2019t know as much as we do now,\u201d Will Ulrich said of the National Weather Service. Ulrich is the Warning Coordination Meteorologist for the National Weather Service Office in Melbourne. Ulrich says errors in the forecast tracks of tropical cyclones in the early 2000s could be as large as 300 to 500 miles. Ulrich states, \u201cWhen you think of how large Florida is 250 miles or so from north to south, we\u2019re basically not able to tell you where the storm center of a tropical cyclone is expected to go. Whether it is between Key West to Jacksonville that is a huge gap.\u201d Since the 2004 season, Ulrich explains, advancements in forecasting have allowed the range of error in the cone of uncertainty to be cut in half. \u201cThe resolution of the satellites that we have in 2024 compared to what we had in the 2004 season is exponentially greater,\u201c Ulrich said. Our understanding of forecasting hurricanes and their potential impacts has improved the accuracy of forecasts due to the advancements in weather observation instruments around the globe from the surface and from space. \u201cWhether is it is infrared imagery, whether it is visible or whether is it is precipitation estimates. Those are all things that satellites have been able to advance through the years and better understand the internal structure of a hurricane.\u201d These observations are allowing forecasters to better understand and communicate the potential storm risks to a community compared to 20 years ago. Ulrich states, \u201cWe are now able to provide wind speed probability, time of arrival graphics, storm surge information are all new products that weren\u2019t necessarily available in 2004.\u201d Even though there have been vast improvements in our ability predict and communicate the hazards of a storm, Ulrich says there is still more work that needs to be done. \u201cThe fact is combining that track uncertainty with the intensity uncertainty, there is still a lot we don\u2019t yet know and understand but it is getting better.\u201d said Ulrich Gilson is a meteorologist for Spectrum News 13, the Orlando Sentinel\u2019s news partner.", "summary": "In 2004, the forecast cone of uncertainty was only in its second year of existence.

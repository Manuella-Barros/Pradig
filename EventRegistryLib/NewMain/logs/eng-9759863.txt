Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) has said that it is \"utterly disgraceful\" that Congress has invited \"war criminal\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the chamber as he continues committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn a fiery statement on Tuesday, Tlaib said that Netanyahu should be arrested and sent to the Hague to be tried for war crimes -- far from being given the distinction of speaking to Congress, which he is slated to do Wednesday evening.\n\n\"Netanyahu is a war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress. He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court,\" said Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders perpetuating the genocide, but the U.S. has refused to recognize the ICC's jurisdiction when it comes to Israel.\n\nTlaib said that, under Netanyahu, Israel has \"undeniably\" committed war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza, massacring tens of thousands of Palestinians as the U.S. has provided billions in military support to continue the genocide.\n\n\"Make no mistake: this event is a celebration of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. It is a sad day for our democracy when my colleagues will smile for a photo op with a man who is actively committing genocide,\" Tlaib went on. \"Their silence is betrayal, and history will remember them accordingly.\"\n\nTlaib has not stated if she is going to boycott or not attend Netanyahu's speech, though dozens of her Democratic colleagues in the House and the Senate have said they are doing so, as well as over a hundred congressional staffers.The list includes both moderate Democrats who have generally been staunch supporters of Israel but seemingly have objections to Netanyahu specifically as well as progressives who oppose Zionist apartheid and Israel's violent dispossession of Palestinians.\n\nSignificantly, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) is meeting with Israeli families of hostages instead of attending the speech. Harris, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee for president, is also skipping the address, citing a prior commitment. Both lawmakers are longtime allies of pro-Israel lobbyists like AIPAC.\n\nFigures who have been more outspoken against the genocide have pledged to boycott.\n\n\"Throughout the many years of our country, leaders from dozens of countries with all kinds of political backgrounds and persuasions have been invited to address a joint session of Congress,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday. \"To the best of my knowledge, however, tomorrow will be unique. In bringing Prime Minister Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress, it will be the first time in American history that a war criminal has been given that honor.\"\n\nHouse progressives like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), Cori Bush (D-Missouri), Ilhan Omar (O-Minnesota) and Summer Lee (D-Pennsylvania) also spoke out against the speech.\n\n\"It is a dark day in US history when an authoritarian with warrant requests from the International Criminal Court is allowed to address a joint session of Congress,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"40k Palestinians are dead. Hostages aren't home. Netanyahu is a war criminal.

Cori Bush (D., Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) accused Congress of celebrating genocide by hosting \"war criminal\" Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a Wednesday joint session.\n\nThe pair are among at least 80 Democrats expected to boycott Netanyahu, who was invited by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). The \"Squad\" has been outspoken in pushing anti-Israel rhetoric and denouncing the prime minister.\n\n\"In solidarity with the Palestinian people and all oppressed people across the world, I will be boycotting Prime Minister Netanyahu's joint address to Congress,\" Bush said Tuesday. \"By bestowing Prime Minister Netanyahu with a joint address, Congress is not only continuing to green-light genocide; it is actively celebrating the man at the forefront of that genocide.\"\n\n\"I urge my colleagues to boycott this war criminal and join us in the fight for a just and lasting peace that protects the right to self-determination for Palestinians and Israelis alike,\" she added.\n\nBush is facing a difficult primary challenge next month against a pro-Israel opponent in her St. Louis district, a race that's beginning to mirror Rep. Jamaal Bowman's (D., N.Y.) failed reelection campaign. Bush and Tlaib were the only two House members to vote against a January bill that aimed to bar Oct. 7 terrorists from entering the United States.\n\n\"Netanyahu is a war criminal commiting genocide against the Palestinian people,\" Tlaib said Tuesday. \"It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress. He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake: this event is a celebration of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,\" she added. \"It is a sad day for our democracy when my colleagues will smile for a photo op with a man who is actively committing genocide.\"\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) made similar remarks.\n\n\"It is a dark day in US history when an authoritarian with warrant requests from the International Criminal Court is allowed to address a joint session of Congress,\" she said. \"40k Palestinians are dead. Hostages aren't home. Netanyahu is a war criminal. I will be boycotting his address.\"\n\nLater in the week, Netanyahu is scheduled to meet separately with President Joe Biden; Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee; and former president Donald Trump.\n\nNearly 60 Democrats boycotted Netanyahu's 2015 speech to a joint session, and the Wall Street Journal estimated that Wednesday's total count could rise as high as 100 members of Congress.\n\nWith Harris away at a previously scheduled event, Senate president pro tempore Patty Murray (D., Wash.) would be next in line to preside over the joint session. But Murray is boycotting the speech, leaving Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) as a replacement.\n\nOther prominent Democrats who have announced intentions to skip the speech include former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Rep. Jerry Nadler (N.Y.), who called Netanyahu \"the worst leader in Jewish history.\" Senate Democrats declining to attend include Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Dick Durbin (Ill.), in addition to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), who called Netanyahu a \"war criminal.\"\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus chairwoman Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) also won't attend. Neither will Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), who, like Bush, is facing a primary opponent who has focused on her anti-Israel views.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's speech, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) plans to meet with the families of Oct. 7 hostages who have been critical of the prime minister. \"Squad\" members Ayanna Pressley (D., Mass.) and Greg Casar (D., Texas) will host a news conference during the address to try and pressure the Biden-Harris administration to adopt an arms embargo against Israel.\n\n\"The United States Congress is a sacred institution, and when we convene a joint session of Congress the world pays attention. We should never give this platform to a war criminal,\" Pressley said in a Tuesday statement. \"Instead of platforming Prime Minister Netanyahu and continuing to send bombs that kill innocent

On Wednesday, Tlaib, the only Palestinian American politician in Congress, held up a sign that read \"War Criminal\" and \"Guilty of Genocide\" as her colleagues applauded the Israeli prime minister.\n\nSince the beginning of Israel's war on Gaza, Tlaib has been the most outspoken member of Congress when it comes to the rights of Palestinians. Ahead of Netanyahu's visit, and with the Palestinian death toll reaching at least 39,000 people, she released a statement condemning congressional leadership for inviting him.\n\n\"Netanyahu is a war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" she said. \"It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress. He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court.\"\n\nTlaib's fellow Squad member, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, boycotted Netanyahu's address altogether. In a post on X, Ocasio-Cortez wrote, \"It is a dark day in US history when an authoritarian with warrant requests from the International Criminal Court is allowed to address a joint session of Congress.\"\n\nSeveral other Democrats boycotted Netanyahu, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"Speaker Pelosi will not be attending today's Joint Meeting of Congress,\" said Pelosi's spokesperson, Ian Kraeger. \"This morning, she will join a Members meeting with Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack and kidnappings.\" Pelosi later told Politico that it was \"inappropriate\" for Netanyahu to be invited.\n\nAlso boycotting Netanyahu were over 100 congressional interns, who wrote in a statement, \"We urge our representatives to respond to the collective will of the American people and reject any semblance of endorsement for Netanyahu's actions.\"\n\nIn May, the International Criminal Court determined that parties on both sides of the conflict had committed war crimes, and requested arrest warrants for senior Hamas and Israeli officials, including Netanyahu. In his address to Congress, Netanyahu said that the ICC was \"trying to shackle Israel's hands and prevent us from defending ourselves.\" He also called called accusations that Israel was committing a genocide against Palestinians \"outrageous slanders.\"\n\nNetanyahu will meet with President Biden on Thursday, where the president will reportedly \"take a tougher tone\" with the prime minister in hopes to end the conflict.", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_craighead@thecut.com", "name": "Olivia Craighead", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashida Tlaib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b77/1d2/b13e46a361a4fd316acbeda4e6b3d0fe16-war-criminal-sign.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759863", "eventUri": "eng-9759863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1513, "textEnd": 1522}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Both Harris and Biden will still meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.\n\nNancy Pelosi is the latest and most high-profile in a string of Democrats to confirm they will not attend Netanyahu's address to Congress.\n\nThis is not the first time that US lawmakers have boycotted a speech by the Israeli prime minister.\n\nIn March 2015, the last time Netanyahu addressed Congress, 58 members were reported to have boycotted the speech. Biden also did not attend in his then-role as vice president, largely because President Obama was not alerted ahead of time.\n\nThe grid below shows all the members of Congress who have so far decided to boycott today's address. Click on each member to see their stance on Netanyahu.\n\nAt least nine senators and 29 representatives have so far said that they will not attend Netanyahu's address to Congress, in addition to Harris. The vast majority of these are Democrats.\n\nBut one Republican representative for Kentucky, Thomas Massie, has also announced today that he will boycott the speech.\n\n\"The purpose of having Netanyahu address Congress is to bolster his political standing in Israel and to quell [international] opposition to his war. I don't feel like being a prop so I won't be attending,\" he said in a statement on X/Twitter.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet with the Israeli prime minister in his Florida residence Mar-a-Lago on Friday.\n\nIndependent senator Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish, has long been vocal in his criticism of Israel's war in Gaza, and accused Netanyahu of being a \"war criminal\" on Monday.\n\nBoth the oldest Jewish American Democrat -- Jan Schakowsky -- and the youngest -- Sara Jacobs -- are also choosing to boycott the address.\n\n\"I just came from listening to hostage families. We're very clear that the most important thing to get their family members back is to end the war and to get a ceasefire,\" Jacobs told The Independent's Eric Garcia today.\n\nThe first Gen-Z member of Congress, Florida's 27-year-old Maxwell Frost, has also boycotted, saying: \"Netanyahu should be focused on working towards a peaceful end to the conflict, not coming to Congress to rally support for his brutal offensive.\"\n\nPalestinian-American Rep. Rashida Tlaib told The Independent: \"Netanyahu is a war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress.\"\n\nThough there was speculation on whether she would boycott, Tlaib is currently in attendance at Netanyahu's speech today.\n\n\"It is a sad day for our democracy when my colleagues will smile for a photo op with a man who is actively committing genocide. It is hypocritical to claim to be concerned about the massive death toll of innocent civilians, and then turn around and welcome the person responsible for these war crimes to our Capitol,\" she said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAs Netanyahu gears up to give his speech, dozens more members of Congress are saying they will not attend in the final moments.

Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor.\n\nThe war between the terror group Hamas and Israel is in its ninth month since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians, which killed some 1,200 people. The Gaza death toll has topped 39,000 in recent days, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu, in his fourth address to Congress, described the war in Gaza as a \"clash between barbarism and civilization.\" He condemned American protesters as \"useful idiots\" for Iran, praised the Israeli-U.S. alliance and promised \"total victory\" in the war.\n\nNetanyahu accused American protesters of the Israel-Hamas war of standing with the militants who he said killed babies during Hamas' attack last fall.\n\n\"Many choose to stand with evil, they stand with Hamas, they stand with rapists and murderers,\" Netanyahu said. \"... They should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nHe said that after Israel defeats Hamas \"a new Gaza\" could emerge and that Israel hold no plans to \"resettle\" the area.\n\nNetanyahu didn't use the words \"cease-fire\" in his remarks, though he said the war could end if Hamas surrendered and returned hostages.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister called for the U.S. and Israel to \"stand together.\"\n\nWhen

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) approached Tlaib on the floor, as the speech was ongoing, and asked her to put the sign down, according to a source familiar.\n\nAt one point, Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Fla.) walked over to the pair \"to de-escalate if need be,\" he told The Hill.\n\n\"They were talking through their issues calmly, so I went and sat back down,\" he added.\n\nTlaib's presence in the chamber raised eyebrows, with many expecting her to skip the event overall. In a post on X before the speech, the congresswoman said she was attending with her guest, Hani Almadhoun, who she said lost more than 150 family members in the war in Gaza.\n\nTlaib was censured in November for her criticisms of Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nDemocrats boycott speech as protests ring in chamber, D.C.\n\nWhile Tlaib protested Netanyahu's speech with her sign, other Democrats showed their opposition to the Israeli prime minister by skipping the address altogether.\n\nAt least 30 House Democrats and a handful of Senate Democrats announced before the speech that they would not attend the address. Some opted to meet with families of hostages held by Hamas and attend a panel discussion focused on a path to peace.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was one of the most notable names to skip the event, and she ripped Netanyahu's speech in a statement after.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation in the House Chamber today was by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States,\" she wrote on X.\n\nProtests, meanwhile, took place inside and outside the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said it arrested six people in the chamber. Or Gat -- whose mother was killed on Oct. 7, whose sister is still held in Gaza and whose brother was arrested on Wednesday -- told The Hill that all six of those detained were family members of hostages. They were released later in the day.\n\nAt Union Station -- just blocks from the Capitol -- protesters removed American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags and graffitied \"Hamas is comin,\" \"free Gaza\" and \"all zionists are bastards\" on a statue outside the station.\n\nNetanyahu responds to anti-Israel protests: 'Iran's useful idiots'\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters -- both on and off college campuses -- have made their discontent with the Israel-Hamas war known for months.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu took them on directly, arguing that they are on the side of \"evil,\" attacking their intelligence and, at one point, referring to them as \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\n\"Incredibly many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers,\" Netanyahu said, later adding \"they should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nHe then spoke directly to protesters in Washington.\n\n\"When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nAt one point, the prime minister called out signs that read \"gays for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Some of these protestors hold up signs proclaiming 'gays for Gaza.' They might as well hold up signs saying 'chickens for KFC,'\" he said. Same-sex conduct is banned in Gaza, according to Amnesty International.\n\nNetanyahu gave a shout out to the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who drew headlines when they held up an American flag during a pro-Palestinian protest on campus.\n\n\"And I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina who protected the American flag, protected the American flag against these anti-Israel protesters,\" he said.\n\nSchumer, Netanyahu exchange head nods in sign of tension\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Netanyahu exchanged head nods -- not a handshake -- ahead of Wednesday's speech, an icy moment that reflects the tense relationship between the two.\n\nThe tensions between Netanyahu and Schumer were heightened after the Democratic leader, in a high-profile floor speech, called for new elections in Israel and declared that the prime minister had \"lost his way.\"\n\nNetanyahu responded, calling the remarks \"totally inappropriate.\"\n\nDespite that, Schumer ended up signing the invite for Netanyahu to address Congress -- though after a delay. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) previously told The Hill that he sent Schumer a draft invitation in April, but the majority leader waited weeks before signing it.\n\nHarris, Vance absent from the chamber\n\nVice President Harris and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) did not attend Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday, absences that were noticed in the chamber.\n\nHarris, who is running for president after President Biden dropped out of the race this weekend, did not preside over the chamber during Netanyahu's address because she was traveling to Indianapolis for a previously-scheduled address, an aide for the vice president said. She will, however, meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, separate from Biden's sit-down with him.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, filled in her spot.\n\nVance -- who former President Trump has selected as his running mate -- meanwhile, was not in attendance because he had \"duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,\" Jason Miller, senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said earlier this week.\n\n\"Senator Vance stands steadfastly with the people of Israel in their fight to defend their homeland, eradicate terrorist threats, and bring back their countrymen held hostage,\" he added.\n\nDemocrats criticized Vance's absence while Republicans slammed Harris for missing the event.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mychael_schnell@thehill.com", "name":

Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) held up a sign stating \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke before a joint session of Congress on July 24.\n\nThe image of Tlaib holding the \"war criminal\" sign went viral on X, with some people slamming her for holding up the sign. Many on X were quick to respond. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) called Tlaib \"Iran's useful idiot.\"\n\n\"Antisemite Rashida Tlaib holds up this sign as Prime Minister Netanyahu speaks of the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists, including murdering 39 Americans,\" Stop Antisemitism posted. \"Why does Tlaib never mention them? OR the U.S. hostages STILL being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas?\"\n\nJournalist David Collier wrote that Netanyahu gave \"A great speech ... laying out a vision for a post conflict Gaza. Constant applause and standing ovations - clearly a popular man here.\" He also got in a dig at Tlaib, writing \"Also nice of [Tlaib] to carry a name tag so we could all identify her.\"\n\nBoston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby posted, \"Yes, @RashidaTlaib is an antisemite and a hater of the Jewish state, and the sign she is holding up is vile. But I give her credit for attending @Netanyahu's speech. She may reject every word he says -- but at least she is hearing every word.\"\n\nTlaib defended herself, posting: \"I will never back down in speaking truth to power. The apartheid government of Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians. Palestinians will not be erased. Solidarity with all those outside of these walls in the streets protesting and exercising their right to dissent.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Netanyahu stressed the importance of the United States and Israel standing together amidst \"a clash between barbarism and civilization\" in the Middle East. \"When we stand together something really simple happens: We win, they lose,\" he declared. The Israeli prime minister also compared the Oct. 7 massacre to Pearl Harbor and 9/11 as days \"that will forever live in infamy.\"\n\nNetanyahu also lambasted anti-Israel protesters as \"useful idiots.\" Some of these protesters, he said \"hold up signs proclaiming, 'Gays for Gaza.'

While some Democrats like presumptive presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris are skipping the address due to prior scheduling conflicts, others like Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are objecting to the speech because of Netanyahu's handling of the Israel- Hamas conflict, calling him a \"war criminal\" who is \"committing genocide\" against Palestinians.\n\n\"It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress,\" Tlaib said in a press release on Tuesday. \"He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court.\"\n\nDespite Tlaib's harsh criticisms of Netanyahu, she has not publicly indicated whether or not she will be attending the address yet. Tlaib's fellow squad members however, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Cori Bush of Minnesota all publicly announced that they will be boycotting the speech. l Court is allowed to address a joint session of Congress,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a X post on Tuesday. \"40k Palestinians are dead. Hostages aren't home. Netanyahu is a war criminal. I will be boycotting this address.\"\n\n\"By bestowing Prime Minister Netanyahu with a joint address, Congress is not only continuing to green-light genocide; it is actively celebrating the man at the forefront of that genocide,\" Bush said in a X post on Tuesday. \"I urge my colleagues to boycott this war criminal and join us in the fight for a just and lasting peace that protects the right to self-determination for Palestinians and Israelis alike.\"\n\nOn the Senate side, prominent Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois have also said they will publicly boycott Netanyahu's address.\n\n\"Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress,\" Sanders said in a X post on Monday. \"On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two- state solution should be roundly condemned. In my view, his right-wing, extremist government should not receive another nickel of U.S. taxpayer support to continue the inhumane destruction of Gaza.\"\n\nIn 2015, 58 lawmakers skipped Netanyahu's

Six protesters were arrested inside the House of Representatives before Netanyahu began speaking. While some lawmakers gave Netanyahu a standing ovation, others chose to stay away.\n\nNetanyahu's US visit comes amid growing concerns over the humanitarian toll of Israel's nine-month ground invasion in Gaza, with Americans deeply divided on the issue. Netanyahu's speech highlighted the sharp divisions within the US Congress and the country at large on Israel's actions in the region.\n\nIn his address, Netanyahu said only military pressure can free the hostages and defeat Hamas, which launched a shock attack on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians.\n\nNetanyahu said he was \"confident\" in efforts to secure the release of the 114 hostages still in Gaza, where Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 39,145 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nHe also used his address to call for a global alliance against Iran, which he accuses of funding anti-Israel protests.

Bernie Sanders, who has been a vocal critic of Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, said, \"Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the U.S. Congress.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,\" he said. \"As I stated last month, I will not be attending his address.\"\n\nAll of the other protesting senators are Democrats, including Patty Murray, Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, Brian Schatz, Jeff Merkley, Dick Durbin, Tim Kaine and Peter Welch.\n\nVan Hollen said last week that it was a \"big mistake\" to invite Netanyahu to Congress and he would not attend.\n\n\"The actions and words of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his ultra-right extremist coalition, both before and since the Oct. 7 attacks, have weakened the ties between the United States and Israel,\" he said on the Senate floor.\n\nAt a pro-Israel event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week, Johnson noted that Democratic lawmakers planned to protest Netanyahu's address to Congress.\n\n\"There's a number of Democrats in the House who have said they are going to boycott the event, and then some others are going to protest,\" he said.\n\nAlso, 32 members of the House of Representatives announced their intention to skip the address, with Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American, slamming the invitation and calling for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\n\"Netanyahu is a war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people.

UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive against Gaza since an Oct. 7 attack by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas.\n\nNearly 39,100 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 90,000 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver nine months into the Israeli onslaught, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source":

Rashida Tlaib protested the right-wing leader's Wednesday address before a joint meeting of Congress by holding up a sign reading \"war criminal\" and \"guilty of genocide.\"\n\n\"They will not erase us. Palestinians exist and we deserve to live. Our presence today will be a reminder that we aren't going anywhere,\" Tlaib (D-Mich.) said on social media. \"I will never back down in speaking truth to power. The apartheid government of Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians.\"\n\nTlaib -- the only Palestinian American member of Congress -- brought a guest: Hani Almadhoun, \"who has lost over 150 members of his extended family in Netanyahu's genocide\" in Gaza.\n\n\"After witnessing his sister forced to eat animal feed, he and his family were determined to start a soup kitchen to feed their starving neighbors,\" the congresswoman said. \"The Israeli apartheid regime is using starvation as a weapon of war, a war crime.\"\n\nMore than 135 congressional Democrats, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) boycotted Netanyahu's speech.\n\n\"Netanyahu is not only a war criminal. He is a liar,\" Sanders said on social media. \"All humanitarian organizations agree: Tens of thousands of children face starvation because his extremist government continues to block aid. Israelis want him out of office. So he came to Congress to campaign.\"\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said, \"Just so we're clear, Netanyahu has lost so many people that he is addressing just a fraction of Congress.\"\n\n\"When this happens, they fill the seats with nonmembers, like what they do at award ceremonies, in order to project the appearance of full attendance and support.\"\n\nRep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) said on social media: \"I won't attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech today. His military has reportedly killed over 39,000 Palestinians. He hasn't brought the hostages home. He hasn't made Israel any safer. We need tangible actions to end this war and all the suffering -- not performative gestures.\"\n\n\"It's *because* of my Jewish upbringing and values that I cannot attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's address today,\" she explained.\n\nRep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) said in statement: \"I am boycotting Netanyahu's address. Today, families of Israeli hostages called the prime minister's speech a 'PR stunt' intended to cover up his own failures.\"\n\n\"Not only has Netanyahu failed to safely return the hostages -- he has killed, harmed, or displaced nearly every Palestinian in Gaza, has failed to keep Israelis safe, and is risking the United States' own security by trying to drag us into another endless war in the Middle East,\" he continued.\n\n\"The United States must end unconditional military aid to the Israeli government, and instead secure an immediate cease-fire, a return of the hostages, and long-term peace,\" Casar added.\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) wished Tlaib a happy birthday in a social media post saying, \"To my sister Rashida: You were born for a time like this.\"\n\n\"The only Palestinan in Congress during a genocide of your people,\" he added. \"Sitting through a speech of that war criminal as colleagues applaud. You stand strong. We love and honor you.\"\n\nStephen Miles, president of the peace group Win Without War, said in a statement that \"we are grateful to the many, many members of Congress who chose to not attend Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech to Congress today.\"\n\n\"This was a political stunt dreamed up by a House speaker trying to score political points and embraced by the prime minister as a desperate ploy to try and blunt the massive global condemnation and domestic political opposition he faces,\" Miles added. \"It's a speech that never should have happened.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is also the Senate president, did not preside over Wednesday's meeting. Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in the wake of President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race earlier this week, is scheduled to meet privately with Netanyahu on Thursday.\n\nNetanyahu's speech -- which was met with frequent uproarious applause from lawmakers and other attendees -- took aim not only at Hamas \"monsters,\" but also against \"Iran's axis of terror,\" which he said \"confronts America, Israel, and our Arab friends.\"\n\n\"This is not a clash of civilizations, it's a clash between barbarism and civilization, between those who glorify death and those who sanctify life,\" said the leader of a nation whose armed forces have killed or wounded more than 130,000 Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu condemned what he called the \"slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal\" that are \"meant to demonize the Jewish state and demonize Jews everywhere.\"\n\nTaking aim at pro-Palestinian protests across the United States -- many of them Jewish-led -- Netanyahu lamented that \"many anti-Israel protesters choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers.\"\n\n\"For all we know, Iran is funding the protests that are taking place outside right now,\" Netanyahu said, citing unsubstantiated Biden administration claims. \"When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting, and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming, 'Gays for Gaza,'\" he mocked. \"They might as well hold up signs that say, 'Chickens for KFC!'\"\n\n\"These protesters chant, 'From the river to the sea,' but many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about,\" the prime minister added.\n\nHundreds of Jewish-led demonstrators were arrested inside a congressional building on Tuesday while protesting the U.S. government's continued support for Israel's assault on Gaza and Netanyahu's then-forthcoming address. Thousands more protesters took to the streets of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, where peace groups planned to surround the Capitol.\n\n\"There is a war criminal in town,\" Council on American Islamic Relations national executive director Nihad Awad said in a speech to protesters. \"This war criminal Netanyahu has a long history of crimes against humanity.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Netanyahu also thanked Biden \"for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on October 7,\" which the prime minister said was \"like 20 9/11s in one day.\"\n\nBiden has expressed his \"unwavering\" support for the key Middle Eastern ally and has approved billions of dollars in new military aid and more than 100 arms sales to the country since October. The Biden administration has also vetoed several United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu implored the U.S. to give even more, saying, \"Give us the tools faster, and we will finish the job faster.\"\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms, and returns all the hostages,\" added the prime minister, who for years facilitated massive financial support for the militant resistance group -- whose political arm rules Gaza -- in order to weaken the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nOn Monday, Tlaib said that Netanyahu should be arrested while in the United States.\n\n\"Netanyahu is a war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" she argued. \"It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress. He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court.\"\n\nICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has applied for arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity including extermination committed on and after October 7.\n\nDuring his speech, Netanyahu accused the ICC of \"blood libels\" against Israel, saying the tribunal \"shamefully accused Israel of deliberately starving the people of Gaza\" -- allegations echoed by the South Africa-led genocide case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), United Nations experts, and human rights groups.\n\nU.N. World Food Program Executive Director Cindy McCain said in May that there is \"full-blown famine\" in Gaza, where dozens of Palestinians -- mostly children -- have died due to malnutrition, dehydration, and lack of medical care, and hundreds of thousands of others are on the brink of starvation.\n\nNetanyahu also accused the ICC of lying about Israeli forces \"deliberately targeting civilians,\" over 39,000 of whom including 16,000 children have been killed since October.\n\nThe prime minister claimed that Israel \"has implemented more precautions to prevent civilian harm than any military in history, and beyond what international law requires.\"\n\n\"The ICC is trying to shackle Israel's hands and prevent Israel from defending itself,\" Netanyahu said. \"And if Israel's hands are tied, America's are next.\"\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he added. \"Israel will always defend itself.\"\n\nNetanyahu further claimed that civilian casualties during Israel's recent Rafah offensive were \"practically none,\" ignoring hundreds of Palestinians including many women and children who died in Israeli attacks on the city and its environs, including multiple massacres of refugees in tent encampments.\n\nIsraeli forces \"should not be condemned for how they're conducting the war in Gaza, they should be commended for it,\" Netanyahu asserted.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces troops have been accused of torturing, raping, and summarily executing Palestinian civilians, including children. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres last month added Israel to his so-called \"List of Shame\" of countries that kill and injure children during wars and other armed conflicts.\n\nIn addition to its ICC woes and the ICJ genocide case, the latter tribunal ruled last week in a separate case that the 57-year Israeli occupation of Palestine is an illegal form of apartheid that must end \"as rapidly as possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib", "type":

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) staged a silent protest during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress, holding a double-sided sign that read \"War Criminal\" and \"Guilty of Genocide\" as he delivered his speech.\n\nAs Netanyahu entered the House floor for his joint address to Congress, Tlaib remained sitting and did not join in with applause from other lawmakers as he masde his way to the stage. The Michigan Democrat remained mostly motionless as Netanyahu gave his address, declining to join in with cheers or applause but instead holding up her sign during remarks.\n\nTlaib attracted attention from others in the chamber, with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) walking over to confront her about the sign. After a short exchange, Luna left Tlaib, who kept the sign up.\n\nHowever, congressional staffers approached Tlaib multiple times to put the sign away, after which the Michigan Democrat would do so before returning to its uplifted position.\n\nThe silent protest comes after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) warned lawmakers not to disrupt the speech otherwise they risk being arrested and charged by U.S. Capitol Police. At least five spectators were apprehended during the beginning of Netanyahu's speech after wearing \"Seal the Deal Now\" t-shirts, referring to a ceasefire-hostage deal in Gaza.\n\nTlaib has long been an outspoken critic of Netanyahu amid the war in Israel and has repeatedly called for a ceasefire while rejecting additional aid to the country. Those comments eventually led to Tlaib's censure last year, when House Republicans and a handful of her Democratic colleagues formally condemned her for \"promoting false narratives\" about the Oct. 7 attack against Israel by the Hamas militant group and allegedly calling for the \"destruction of the state of Israel.\"\n\nTlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, wore brooch with a Palestinian pin on a black and white keffiyeh, an icon of solidarity.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Tlaib posted a photo with Hani Almadhoun, who she said would join her in the chamber.

Some partisan hacks have tried to portray this as disloyalty to the Democratic Party, but such is the nature of partisan brain rot. It cannot comprehend the notion of doing politics, as it is inherently subservient to power. Partisans do as they are told, while those who understand politics attempt to influence the people telling partisans what to do.\n\nTlaib is not opposing Harris's candidacy, but using what little leverage she has as an elected official from a swing state to try to accomplish tangible policy goals. After Joe Biden helped usher us into a coconut-based future, Rep. Tlaib released the following statement:\n\n\"I welcome the opportunity to engage Vice President Harris as my team and I work hard to inspire our Democratic base in the 12th Congressional District. They want to see a permanent ceasefire and an end to the funding of genocide in Gaza. They want to see immigration policies that support a fair and humane system, not one that vilifies immigrants. They want to see a clear path to ending fossil fuel subsidies that continue to poison our air and water. They want to see the end to our inhumane health care system and the attempts to dismantle our public education system. They want us to fight against corporate greed that wants to eliminate unions and keep our families in the cycle of poverty. I am eager to speak to Vice President Harris about all of these issues and more.\"\n\nIf you read that passage and your first response is to get mad at a supposed betrayal of the Democratic Party, you have partisan brain worms. Everything Rep. Tlaib put in there is a concrete policy ask, and she ended her statement by asserting the need to \"defeat Donald Trump and the dangerous implications of Project 2025.\" This is what normal politics looks like, and it says a lot about the Democratic Party and her progressive allies that basically everyone except for Rashida Tlaib just unquestionably lined up behind Kamala Harris after they were told to without trying to use any of their power to move her left.\n\nKamala Harris might be better for the left than Joe Biden. Her record on climate is pretty encouraging. Reports indicate she is more amenable to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza than Biden. Harris has endorsed policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal in the past before kinda backtracking. There are reasons to believe that she could be a lefty ally, but it won't happen without the left trying to drag her in our direction like we did with Joe Biden. If everyone just does what they're told and never questions anything, then the donors who created this shitshow will continue to drive policy and push the Democrats further to the right. There needs to be a counterweight to them on the left.\n\nAnd it needs to be more than just Rashida Tlaib. I defended Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's gambit to toss a flailing Joe Biden a lefty lifeline because I think it was all upside and no downside, but uncritically supporting Harris without any policy asks is a total waste of the power the left has amassed since 2016. Why not just take the agenda you forced on Biden and withhold your endorsement until Harris adopts it too? Rashida Tlaib is the only Democrat who is trying to use this moment to push the party to adopt serious policy solutions to major problems, and it is dismaying seeing her hung out to dry like this by her progressive caucus.\n\nThere are risks to this strategy, of course. Using this moment of Democratic unity to drive a policy wedge into the party could leave Tlaib on the outside looking in should the party win the White House, and potentially make it more difficult to achieve her policy goals. Challenging power sounds good in the abstract and in Rage Against the Machine songs, but the reality is that it always carries immense risks because the very nature of power is that it holds all the cards. The best way to counter this advantage is to use our strength in numbers, but unfortunately Tlaib's colleagues did not provide her that benefit. That she is still venturing out on this limb alone speaks to her bravery as a politician.\n\nRashida Tlaib deserves better. The Palestinian people deserve better. The genocide is still ongoing, even if power's favored stenographers were able to replace massacred Palestinian children with protesting American college students in the media's collective consciousness. Kamala Harris is part of an administration aiding and abetting a genocide, and she shouldn't get a pass just because there are media reports suggesting that she is not as callous towards Palestinian life as Joe Biden.\n\nThe only vote that actually matters is 104 days away, and it is not unreasonable to try to leverage its power in the meantime. Gaza and the West Bank and southern Lebanon are all under attack right now by an out-of-control pariah state led by an indicted autocratic maniac gleefully perpetuating a genocide with tangible American support. Horrific doesn't even begin to describe this situation, and the lack of urgency within the Democratic Party to do anything to ameliorate the suffering in the region is an indictment of their bankrupt priorities.\n\nUnfortunately for Tlaib, her principled stance is running into an impossible political situation, which can be measured by her colleagues' capitulation. Addressing the genocide in Gaza, our inhumane immigration system and the Democrats' lurch to the right on the issue, or the continued subsidies for unfathomably wealthy companies poisoning the planet, requires critiquing Joe Biden's presidency, which is verboten in the Democratic Party right now.\n\nThe implicit deal being offered by Democratic Party power brokers was that a man losing a fight to Father Time would step aside for a more competent generation, and he would instantly become venerated, while stubbornly staying on the ticket would leave him reviled. Now that Biden has made good on his end of the bargain, the Democratic Party and its favored media organs are going into overdrive to write Joe Biden's legacy in permanent ink while he still ships bombs to Benjamin Netanyahu. If anything, Rashida Tlaib is the one trying to protect his legacy by pressuring his handpicked replacement to reverse his barbarous policies.\n\nThis is what politics looks like. The fantasy booking for Vice President that consumes so much of the media narrative now is fun and all, but that's an indulgence in the superficiality of politics. It's a sugar high. It is one of the many shiny things that power distracts us with while they influence the levers of government in the shadows, demonstrating a far better understanding of the true nature of politics than partisans treating it like their favorite TV show ever do.\n\nRashida Tlaib understands power's aims, which is why she is trying to use this historic moment to advance policies that would make millions of people's lives immeasurably better. That the party is more concerned with preserving one man's legacy in this moment is a stark reminder of its real priorities. We have a long, long ways to go to become the country we believe ourselves to be, and it will take a lot more Rashida Tlaibs if we are ever to get there.", "source": {"uri": "splinter.com",

Although many members of the Squad and other Democrats boycotted, including Vice President Kamala Harris, there were still many Democrats in attendance, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).\n\nNetanyahu became particularly fired up as he addressed the pro-Hamas protesters who have bought into such propaganda from terrorists who attacked our ally in the Middle East on October 7. While the speech was met with thundering applause and standing ovations, especially at this point, Tlaib wasn't having it.\n\nNot only did the congresswoman remain seated throughout the speech, she also held up a sign that said \"WAR CRIMINAL.\" The other side of her sign read \"GUILTY OF GENOCIDE.\"\n\nAs Netanyahu called out the International Criminal Court (ICC) for falsely accusing Israel of starving Gazans, Tlaib raised her sign, now flipped to the other side, and nodded her head.\n\n\"This is utter complete nonsense, it's a complete fabrication,\" Netanyahu meanwhile said to applause.\n\nNetanyahu reminded later in his speech how Israel goes to great lengths to protect civilians, as well as how Israel has provided more than enough humanitarian aid.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju also shared how Tlaib was confronted not only by a fellow House member, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), but by a House clerk, who approached the Squad member \"multiple times.\" Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) had previously made clear to members that they should not engage in protests.\n\nAlthough she initially complied, Raju noted that Tlaib held up her sign yet again declaring Netanyahu to be a \"WAR CRIMINAL\" as he closed his speech.\n\nTlaib has been one of the most anti-Israel members of Congress and earned the title of \"Antisemite of the Year\" for 2023 by Stop Antisemitism, even beating out Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh for such a title.\n\nLast November, she was censured by the House in a bipartisan vote for spreading falsehoods against Israel, claiming that the Jewish State attacked a hospital when it was misfired terrorist rockets that were responsible. She also defended the pro-Hamas genocidal phrase of \"from the river to the sea,\" a phrase which Netanyahu also lambasted during his Wednesday speech.\n\nTlaib also has the shameful distinction of being the only member in the House not voting for a bipartisan House resolution from February that condemned the rapes and sexual assaults perpetrated by Hamas terrorists against Israeli women during the October 7 attack. Tlaib voted \"present.\"\n\nThe congresswoman's anti-Israel sentiments are nothing new, though. In May of last year, she commemorated the anniversary of Israel's independence by holding an event regarding it as \"Nakba,\" or \"catastrophe.\" After then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) canceled her event at the Capitol, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) allowed it to take place in the committee room for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), which he chairs.\n\nLeading up to Netanyahu's speech in recent days, Tlaib had plenty of posts and reposts smearing Netanyahu, even calling for him to \"be arrested and sent to the [ICC].\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She also wore a Palestinian flag pin and a keffiyeh, the black and white scarf that has been linked with the Palestinian struggle for over half a century.\n\nThe other side of her sign displayed during the controversial address in Washington read: \"Guilty of genocide.\"\n\nRelated: Kamala Harris must break with Biden on Israel and Palestine | Lily Greenberg Call\n\nTlaib was accompanied by an invited guest, Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian who has lost more than 150 members of his extended family since Israel launched its war with the aim, as Netanyahu has often repeated, of \"destroying Hamas\", after the group led a surprise attack on southern Israel from Gaza last October.\n\n\"After witnessing his sister forced to eat animal feed, he and his family were determined to start a soup kitchen to feed their starving neighbors,\" Tlaib wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPrior to Netanyahu's address, on a press call, a coalition of progressives, human rights advocates, former officials in the Biden administration, and some Democratic lawmakers gathered to denounce his invitation to Capitol Hill.\n\nThey called for a US arms embargo on Israel and demanded a ceasefire.\n\nDemocratic House members Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Cori Bush of Missouri joined the call. They were among the dozens of Democratic members of Congress who boycotted Netanyahu's speech.\n\n\"This war, this genocide, has persisted for months as the United States has sent bombs that have claimed the lives of elders, babies, parents, students, journalists and loved ones,\" Pressley said on the call.\n\n\"The United States must immediately halt the transfer and sales of offensive weapons to the state of Israel. We must put an end to this unjust war. We must stop the genocide.\"\n\nIn late June, a senior Biden administration official said Washington has sent $6.5bn worth of security assistance to Israel since 7 October.\n\nIn his remarks, Casar said: \"We have the vast majority of the American people with us, and the vast majority of the American people wanting to protect innocent Palestinian lives, wanting to protect innocent Israeli lives, wanting to make sure that hostages are returned, wanting to make sure the United States uses all its leverage and stops sending offensive weapons to the Israeli government to promote lasting peace.\n\nSeveral former Biden administration officials who resigned from their positions in protest of the president's policies in support of Israel also joined the call.\n\n\"We do need a new policy that reflects American interests and American values,\" said Tariq Habash, a former Biden administration appointee who resigned in January. \"The reality is that inviting a war criminal like Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress to address our nation's leaders and elected officials is not in our national interests. It is not in our national interest to unconditionally supply weapons to his extremist regime that continues to kill civilians.\"\n\nLily Greenberg, the first Jewish political appointee to resign from her position in protest of the president's Gaza policy, said: \"What's very clear is that so many people in our government don't understand that fighting authoritarianism at home also means we have to fight it abroad.\n\n\"We know that Trump's coalition endangers Jews, Palestinians, and so many communities here at home and bringing Netanyahu here - a war criminal who claims to speak on the behalf of Jewish people around the world - also makes us less safe.\"\n\nGreenberg, who also worked on Kamala Harris's brief 2020 presidential campaign, said of the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in this election: \"I am encouraged by the fact that [Harris] is not attending the address this afternoon. I think it seems like a strategic choice.\"\n\nAs vice-president, Harris would typically preside over a joint session during the address of a foreign leader, but was instead on the campaign trail in Indiana.\n\nThe former House speaker Nanci Pelosi also skipped the event, a Pelosi spokesperson told Axios, opting instead \"to meet with Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack and kidnappings.\".\n\nThe US senator and prominent progressive, Bernie Sanders, on Tuesday on the senate floor had condemned Netanyahu's address.\n\nHe said: \"It will be the first time in American history that a war criminal has been given that honor.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here today to say thank you, America,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nHe also acknowledged the historic circumstances of his speech, saying it was his \"profound honour\" to address \"this great citadel of d ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashida Tlaib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759863", "eventUri": "eng-9759863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

She also wore a Palestinian flag pin and a keffiyeh, the black and white scarf that has been linked with the Palestinian struggle for over half a century.\n\nThe other side of her sign displayed during the controversial address in Washington read: \"Guilty of genocide.\"\n\nTlaib was accompanied by an invited guest, Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian who has lost more than 150 members of his extended family since Israel launched its war with the aim, as Netanyahu has often repeated, of \"destroying Hamas\", after the group led a surprise attack on southern Israel from Gaza last October.\n\n\"After witnessing his sister forced to eat animal feed, he and his family were determined to start a soup kitchen to feed their starving neighbors,\" Tlaib wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPrior to Netanyahu's address, on a press call, a coalition of progressives, human rights advocates, former officials in the Biden administration, and some Democratic lawmakers gathered to denounce his invitation to Capitol Hill.\n\nThey called for a US arms embargo on Israel and demanded a ceasefire.\n\nDemocratic House members Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Cori Bush of Missouri joined the call. They were among the dozens of Democratic members of Congress who boycotted Netanyahu's speech.\n\n\"This war, this genocide, has persisted for months as the United States has sent bombs that have claimed the lives of elders, babies, parents, students, journalists and loved ones,\" Pressley said on the call.\n\n\"The United States must immediately halt the transfer and sales of offensive weapons to the state of Israel. We must put an end to this unjust war. We must stop the genocide.\"\n\nIn late June, a senior Biden administration official said Washington has sent $6.5bn worth of security assistance to Israel since 7 October.\n\nIn his remarks, Casar said: \"We have the vast majority of the American people with us, and the vast majority of the American people wanting to protect innocent Palestinian lives, wanting to protect innocent Israeli lives, wanting to make sure that hostages are returned, wanting to make sure the United States uses all its leverage and stops sending offensive weapons to the Israeli government to promote lasting peace.\n\nSeveral former Biden administration officials who resigned from their positions in protest of the president's policies in support of Israel also joined the call.\n\n\"We do need a new policy that reflects American interests and American values,\" said Tariq Habash, a former Biden administration appointee who resigned in January. \"The reality is that inviting a war criminal like Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress to address our nation's leaders and elected officials is not in our national interests. It is not in our national interest to unconditionally supply weapons to his extremist regime that continues to kill civilians.\"\n\nLily Greenberg, the first Jewish political appointee to resign from her position in protest of the president's Gaza policy, said: \"What's very clear is that so many people in our government don't understand that fighting authoritarianism at home also means we have to fight it abroad.\n\n\"We know that Trump's coalition endangers Jews, Palestinians, and so many communities here at home and bringing Netanyahu here - a war criminal who claims to speak on the behalf of Jewish people around the world - also makes us less safe.\"\n\nGreenberg, who also worked on Kamala Harris's brief 2020 presidential campaign, said of the preumptive Democratic nominee for president in this election: \"I am encouraged by the fact that [Harris] is not attending the address this afternoon. I think it seems like a strategic choice.\"\n\nAs vice-president, Harris would typically preside over a joint session during the address of a foreign leader, but was instead on the campaign trail in Indiana.\n\nThe former House speaker Nanci Pelosi also skipped the event, a Pelosi spokesperson told Axios, opting instead \"to meet with Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack and kidnappings.\".\n\nThe US senator and prominent progressive, Bernie Sanders, on Tuesday on the senate floor had condemned Netanyahu's address.\n\nHe said: \"It will be the first time in American history that a war criminal has been given that honor.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

{"id": 237086640, "title": "Navy captain shared &#8216;erotic&#8217; photos of his ex while impersonating her online, feds say", "text": "When a woman learned a fake Facebook account with more than 1,000 friends was impersonating her and shared private photos of her online, she \u201cwas devastated and confounded by who could hate her so much,\u201d according to court documents. Then her mother found a LinkedIn account, which wrongly listed the woman as a pole dancer. The account was also impersonating her, court documents say. The person behind the accounts was U.S. Navy Capt. Theodore E. Essenfeld, the woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of California. Essenfeld, 52, spent more than a year impersonating his ex-girlfriend online while using her name, information and photographs of her to harass her, federal prosecutors said. He did so while they were dating and after their break-up, according to court documents. Under the fake Facebook account, Essenfield joined dating groups, liked multiple users\u2019 posts, sent users \u201ckissy-face emojis\u201d and messages \u2014 and posted \u201cerotic and sexually explicit\u201d content of his ex, prosecutors said. On June 14, a federal jury convicted Essenfeld, of Chula Vista, California, of cyberstalking and identity theft, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office said in a news release. Criminal defense lawyer Kerry Lee Armstrong, who represents Essenfeld, told McClatchy News on June 17 that he and his client are \u201cdejected about the verdict,\u201d but they \u201crespect\u201d the jury\u2019s decision. \u201cWhile Mr. Essenfeld\u2019s actions in this case were immature and juvenile, I do not believe they rose to the level of a crime,\u201d Armstrong said. Fake accounts are created Essenfield and his ex-girlfriend, who was previously in the Navy, met on Match.com and began dating in the Spring of 2018 when they both lived in San Diego, according to court documents. After the Navy transferred Essenfeld to Colorado in January 2020, he and his ex-girlfriend were in a long distance relationship, according to the trial brief. By the Fall of 2020, they both \u201cwent on Match.com without the other\u2019s knowledge,\u201d the trial brief says. Essenfeld eventually discovered his then-girlfriend on the site and created two fake Match.com profiles under the names \u201cEd\u201d and \u201cJerry\u201d to message her, according to the filing. With the fake accounts, he ultimately told her that the Ed and Jerry personas knew about Essenfeld and that they would confront him if \u201cshe did not tell (Essenfeld) about what she had done,\u201d the trial brief says. The woman then told \u201ceverything\u201d to Essenfeld, who never told her \u201cthat he was \u2018Ed\u2019 and \u2018Jerry,\u2019 or that he was also contacting people on Match.com,\u201d according to the trial brief. Essenfeld and his ex-girlfriend stayed together and she moved in with him in Colorado in May 2021 \u2014 before they broke up in August 2021, the trial brief says. More imposter accounts In November 2020, Essenfeld created a fake Yahoo email account and Facebook account pretending to be her, the trial brief says. On the fake Facebook account, he blocked his ex-girlfriend, her family and his family, according to prosecutors. Using the account, he engaged with the woman\u2019s prospective employer\u2019s social media accounts, former co-workers, the university she attended, the Navy and gyms she used to visit, prosecutors said. The month of their breakup, Essenfeld created the imposter LinkedIn account, according to the trial brief. A few months later, in December 2021, a relative of the woman was using an alternative Facebook account and came across the fake account Essenfeld created, according to the trial brief. The woman\u2019s family alerted her to the account before she soon learned of the LinkedIn account, the trial brief says. Though she reported the Facebook account more than 400 times, Facebook didn\u2019t take it down because it \u201cappeared more authentic than the victim\u2019s actual account,\u201d prosecutors said. In February 2022, Essenfeld posted a new Facebook photo album under the Facebook account for his ex-girlfriend called \u201cBedroom Fun,\u201d according to prosecutors. Sixteen \u201csexually explicit\u201d photos shared in the album showed the woman and a man believed to be Essenfeld, whose face wasn\u2019t shown, the trial brief says. After she suspected Essenfeld was running the fake accounts, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service started investigating, the trial brief says. Possible prison time For one count of cyberstalking, Essenfeld is facing up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, prosecutors said. He faces a maximum 15 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine for one count of identity theft, according to prosecutors. Armstrong told McClatchy News that \u201cthe crime of cyberstalking really came down to the definition of what \u2018harassment\u2019 was, and the court rejected my proposal of how to define that word for the jurors.\u201d He said Essenfeld is appealing the case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and has hope that the Ninth Circuit \u201cwill overturn his conviction,\u201d he said. Essenfeld is set to be sentenced on Sept. 6, according to prosecutors. \u201cMr. Essenfeld deserves to be held to account for his cruel campaign to stalk, harass, and intimidate his victim,\u201d Nicholas Carter, the special agent in charge of the NCIS Southwest field office, said in a statement.", "summary": "The man, 52, spent more than a year impersonating his ex-girlfriend online while using her name, information and photographs of her, federal prosecutors said.", "url": "https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/06/17/navy-captain-shared-erotic-photos-of-his-ex-while-impersonating-her-online-feds-say/", "image": "https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2022/07/29/C675YT7Z3FDBBIN3T47ZJXSEPY.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:37:30", "author": "Julia Marnin", "authors": ["Julia Marnin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.158}

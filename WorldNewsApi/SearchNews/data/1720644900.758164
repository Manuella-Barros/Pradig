A number of roads were closed due to floods and rock falls, including the R-328 between Oudtshoorn and the Cango Caves. The Cango Caves, which is a major tourist attraction for the region, was reopened, after being closed for the past three days. Gerda Jacobs and her family from Rustenburg were delighted to be able to see the caves, before continuing on their trip to Kleinmond. \u201cWe are from Rustenburg and we are on our way to Kleinmond to visit my mother. I have my two grandchildren, my daughter-in-law and my son with me. My daughter-in-law specifically has never been here and we thought it would be nice to drive to Oudtshoorn before going to Kleinmond. We were disappointed yesterday when we heard the caves are closed. But this morning, we took a chance and were very happy to see they reopened and that we could go in,\u201d adds Jacobs. Operations Manager of the Cango Caves, Alison Moos, says while it meant three days without business, the Caves themselves have benefitted from the rain. \u201cCango Caves and surrounding area are very dependent on water because we\u2019re situated in a semi-desert area. So the caves constantly needs water for the formations to grow. So it has its positives and negatives. We are so thankful for the rain, Oudtshoorn needs water, we always need water,\u201d explains Moos. The video below is reporting more on the story The past week saw various entities working together to repair damaged infrastructure, and to assist families who were cut off, with necessities. Oudtshoorn Mayor, Chris McPherson says, \u201cIt just goes to show the cooperation between the various spheres of government. I think at this stage, the most important thing is that there was no loss of life. We had problems with the damage incurred to infrastructure, the low-water bridges and our roads. But with the assistance of the engineers from the province, the roads which could have been closed for weeks were reopened again within one day.\u201d While most roads have been reopened, the Meiringspoort Pass remains closed until further notice.

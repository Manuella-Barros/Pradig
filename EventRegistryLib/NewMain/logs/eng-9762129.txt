During a training session on Wednesday, ahead of the first T20I on Saturday, Thushara suffered an injury to his finger during a fielding training session which has ruled him out of at least the three T20I games.\n\nThe six white-ball matches begin with the T20I series on July 27 and it will be followed by the three ODI games. This happens to the second blow to the host nation's pace attack in the recent days, after Dushmantha Chameera got ruled out of the entire tour due to bronchitis and a respiratory infection. Asitha Fernando was named the right-arm pacer's replacement in the ODI and T20I squads.\n\nAs confirmed by team manger Mahinda Halangoda, Thushara suffered the injury under lights at the practice session. This comes up as a big blow for the island nation as Thushara has been a consistent member of Sri Lanka's T20I line up this year. Although, the injury is not on his bowling hand, yet it is severe enough to rule him out of the series.\n\nThe paceman's absence will be deeply felt by the host nation as he has been in a good form recently during Sri Lanka's dismal period. Thushara proved out to be the standout bowlers for the Lankans in the T20 World Cup 2024, claiming 8 wickets in just 3 games. Earlier this year, he also pulled off a T20I hat-trick against Bangladesh, finishing with impressive figures of 5 for 20.

Meanwhile, left-arm pacer Dilshan Madushanka has replaced the injured Thushara, who has a sling action.\n\nThushara was ruled out of the series after suffering an injury to his left thumb during a fielding practice session on July 24.

He was not part of the Lankan side that featured in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup. The left-arm pacer earlier missed the Indian Premier League due to injury. Overall, Madushanka has 14 wickets in as many T20Is at an average of 30.92.\n\nSL's updated squad for India T20I series: Charith Asalanka (captain), Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Janith Perera, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal, Kamindu Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dunith Wellalage, Maheesh Theekshana, Chamindu Wickramasinghe, Matheesha Pathirana, Nuwan Thushara, Asitha Fernando, and Binura Fernando.\n\nAs per the released itinerary, India and Sri Lanka will clash in three T20Is on July 27, 28, and 30, respectively.

The pacer has picked up a finger injury during training. The injury is on his non-bowling hand but severe enough to rule him out. Thushara would have brought some IPL experience with him as well as he played for the Mumbai Indians in the 2024 season.\n\nIn the T20 World Cup 2024, Thushara was the leading wicket-taker for Sri Lanka and his absence will be felt in the squad.

The three-match series between both the sides is set to commence on Saturday (July 27) at Pallekele.\n\nThushara sustained a broken finger during a Wednesday evening training session under lights, as confirmed by Sri Lankan Cricket Board. The injury, although to his non-bowling hand, is severe enough to rule him out of the series. This setback is a significant blow given Thushara's consistent performances in Sri Lanka's T20I lineup this year.\n\nThis injury compounds Sri Lanka's challenges as it follows the earlier loss of Dushmantha Chameera. Chameera, who is yet to recover from bronchitis and a respiratory infection, has been ruled out of the series and replaced by Asitha Fernando. The double blow to the pace attack puts additional pressure on Sri Lanka's bowling unit ahead of the crucial series.\n\nFollowing Thushara's injury, Dilshan Madushanka has been drafted into the squad. Thushara's absence is particularly notable given his impressive recent form.\n\nHe was a standout performer in the T20 World Cup 2024, claiming eight wickets in three matches, including a remarkable four-wicket haul against Bangladesh. His performance was one of the few bright spots in the team's otherwise disappointing campaign.\n\nAdding to the tumult, Sri Lanka's team has undergone significant changes in coaching and captaincy. Chris Silverwood and Wanindu Hasaranga have stepped down as head coach and captain, respectively, post the T20 World Cup. In their stead, Sanath Jayasuriya has taken up the role of interim head coach, while Charith Asalanka has been appointed captain.

The hosts had already lost leader of the attack Dushmantha Chameera before coming to Kandy due to illness and will head into the series against the World Champions with a depleted attack.\n\nThe first T-20 International gets underway on Saturday. The second game is on Sunday followed by the third game on Tuesday. All matches will be played at Pallekele International Stadium.\n\nRight-arm seamer Asitha Fernando was drafted into the side in place of Chameera while left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka has been rushed to Kandy to replace Thushara.\n\nThushara had sustained the injury while doing fielding drills on Wednesday.\n\nSri Lanka had a training session at Pallekele on Thursday evening as well while India were scheduled to train later in the day with newly appointed Head Coach Gautam Gambhir set to address the media prior to training.\n\nIndia are a new look side without Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja, who all retired after they were crowned World Champions in Barbados having beaten South Africa in the T-20 World Cup final last month.\n\nThe tourists also have left out Jasprit Bumrah, but still their pace attack looks quite formidable on paper.\n\nIndian selectors sprung a huge surprise by naming Suryakumar Yadav as captain of the T-20 side ahead of Hardik Pandya. The all-rounder had been understudy to Rohit Sharma and had captained India in the absence of Rohit. He was also vice-captain of the side that won the T-20 World Cup in May.\n\nRohit and Kohli will return to the ODI side when the teams get back to Colombo for the 50 over leg of the tour.\n\nTickets were selling out fast at Pallekele and a full house is expected for all three games. When Sri Lanka hosted Afghanistan in a three match ODI series in March, the matches were played in front of sell out crowds.\n\nThe Sri Lankans are going into the series with lot of momentum behind them with several players excelling in the Lanka Premier League (LPL).\n\nSri Lanka's selectors recalled Avishka Fernando and Kusal Perera after overlooking them for the recent World Cup in the Caribbean and USA. Both players were in good nick during the LPL. Veteran Dinesh Chandimal is also back in the T-20 side having last played in this format in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island"}, "authors": [{"uri":

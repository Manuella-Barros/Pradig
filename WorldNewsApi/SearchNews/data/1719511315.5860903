{"id": 223781624, "title": "'Scandalous': Spanish FM hits back at Israeli counterpart Katz over 'Hamas thanks Spain' video", "text": "Spain's foreign minister condemned a video posted by his Israeli counterpart suggesting Hamas would be grateful to Spain, calling it \"scandalous and execrable,\" in a growing spat between the two countries over the Gaza war. Spain last week announced it would recognize Palestine as a state and in recent days two Spanish government ministers referred to a genocide in Gaza. A short video posted by Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on the social media platform X on Sunday says \"Hamas: Gracias Espa\u00f1a\" (\"Hamas: Thanks Spain\"). 'Simply a PR exercise': Irish president dismisses claims of antisemitism in Ireland'Antisemitism on steroids': How anti-Jewish hatred rose across Europe in wake of October 7Israel cuts off Spanish embassy from providing services to West Bank Palestinians \"We are not going to fall into provocations. The video is scandalous and execrable,\" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told a news conference in Brussels. \"It's scandalous because all the world knows, including my colleague in Israel, that Spain condemned the actions of Hamas from the first moment. And execrable for the use of one of those symbols of Spanish culture.\" Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said on Saturday that the conflict in Gaza is a \"real genocide\", echoing a comment by Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Diaz who last week also described the conflict as a genocide. Israel has strongly rejected accusations made against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice that it is committing a genocide against Palestinians, arguing it is acting to defend itself and fighting Hamas. The Israeli embassy in Madrid responded to Robles' comments in a statement posted on Saturday on X. \"We regret that\u2026 Robles has endorsed the false and unfounded story of the terrorist organization Hamas. Israel fights in Gaza in accordance with international law in a war against Hamas that it neither started nor wanted, a consequence of the unprecedented massacre perpetrated last October 7.\" The EU, like the United States, deems Hamas a terrorist organization. Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, declared this week it would recognize a Palestinian state on May 28. Israel said this amounted to a \"reward for terrorism\" and recalled its ambassadors from the three capitals. In her remarks in a television interview on Saturday, Robles said Madrid's recognition of Palestine was not a move against Israel but was aimed at helping end violence in Gaza.", "summary": "Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted a short video on X, saying 'Hamas: Gracias Espa\u00f1a,' following Spain's declaration that it would recognize a Palestinian state", "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-05-26/ty-article/outrageous-spanish-fm-lashes-out-at-israeli-counterpart-katz-over-gracias-hamas-video/0000018f-b5b7-d33c-a5bf-ffb75e560000", "image": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000018f-b5c9-dca9-a5cf-b5c9b7480000/f2/85/4fc7630f4065adf9243cfd49b265/69943-2.jpg?height=630&width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:50:27", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "il", "sentiment": -0.245}

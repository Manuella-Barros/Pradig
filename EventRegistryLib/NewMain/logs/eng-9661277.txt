The effort was intended to counter what Washington then saw as China's growing geopolitical sway around the globe, including in Southeast Asia. It began under former President Donald Trump and ended months after President Joseph Biden took office.\n\nThe Senate inquiry is intended to examine the Reuters findings and \"determine the ramifications of the actions of the U.S. Military, any potential breach of international law by the United States of America, and the possible legal recourse available to the Philippines, considering that such (an) anti-vax and misinformation campaign threatens national security,\" according to the resolution from Marcos, sister of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nCastro's resolution, which was also signed by two other lawmakers, urges the nation's House of Representatives to conduct an investigation into the U.S. military campaign. It says \"such underhanded tactics by a foreign military power sowing disinformation in the Philippines are a brazen affront to our national sovereignty and the democratic rights of Filipinos to freely access truthful information vital to public health and safety.\"\n\nA senior Defense Department official acknowledged to Reuters that the U.S. military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage China's vaccines in the developing world during the pandemic, but declined to provide details. The official said that new policies and controls had been put in place, following an internal review in 2021, that would block similar operations in the future.\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman said that the U.S. military \"uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the U.S., allies, and partners.\" She also noted that China had started a \"disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nSenator Marcos told reporters in the Philippines this week that she was motivated to investigate the matter because she believed it may have put the lives of Filipinos at risk. At the time of the secret U.S. military operation, the primary vaccine option in the Philippines was China's Sinovac inoculation. During the pandemic, the Philippines suffered among the worst COVID infection rates in the region, and officials struggled to persuade its citizens to get vaccinated.\n\nThe Reuters investigation was based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former U.S officials, military contractors, social media analysts and academic researchers. Reporters also reviewed Facebook, X and Instagram posts, technical data and documents about a set of fake social media accounts used by the U.S. military.\n\nReuters could not determine what impact the military's influence campaign had on public health in the Philippines. But some American public health experts say the propaganda program endangered lives. \"I don't think it's defensible,\" said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. \"I'm extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the U.S. government would do that.\"\n\nIn a statement to Chinese media, a Sinovac spokeswoman also decriedNew Tab, opens new tab the U.S. military's campaign. \"Stigmatizing vaccination will lead to a series of consequences, such as a lower inoculation rate, the outbreak and spread of disease, social panic and insecurity, as well as crises of confidence in science and public health,\" said Sinovac spokeswoman Yuan Youwei.\n\nReporting by Karen Lema in Manila and Chris Bing in Washington.

The effort was intended to counter what Washington then saw as China\u00b4s growing geopolitical sway around the globe, including in Southeast Asia. It began under former President Donald Trump and ended months after President Joseph Biden took office.\n\nThe Senate inquiry is intended to examine the Reuters findings and \"determine the ramifications of the actions of the U.S. Military, any potential breach of international law by the United States of America, and the possible legal recourse available to the Philippines, considering that such (an) anti-vax and misinformation campaign threatens national security,\" according to the resolution from Marcos, sister of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nCastro\u00b4s resolution, which was also signed by two other lawmakers, urges the nation\u00b4s House of Representatives to conduct an investigation into the U.S. military campaign. It says \"such underhanded tactics by a foreign military power sowing disinformation in the Philippines are a brazen affront to our national sovereignty and the democratic rights of Filipinos to freely access truthful information vital to public health and safety.\"\n\nA senior Defense Department official acknowledged to Reuters that the U.S. military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage China\u00b4s vaccines in the developing world during the pandemic, but declined to provide details. The official said that new policies and controls had been put in place, following an internal review in 2021, that would block similar operations in the future.\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman said that the U.S. military \"uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the U.S., allies, and partners.\" She also noted that China had started a \"disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nSenator Marcos told reporters in the Philippines this week that she was motivated to investigate the matter because she believed it may have put the lives of Filipinos at risk. At the time of the secret U.S. military operation, the primary vaccine option in the Philippines was China\u00b4s Sinovac inoculation. During the pandemic, the Philippines suffered among the worst COVID infection rates in the region, and officials struggled to persuade its citizens to get vaccinated.\n\nThe Reuters investigation was based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former U.S officials, military contractors, social media analysts and academic researchers. Reporters also reviewed Facebook, X and Instagram posts, technical data and documents about a set of fake social media accounts used by the U.S. military.\n\nReuters could not determine what impact the military\u00b4s influence campaign had on public health in the Philippines. But some American public health experts say the propaganda program endangered lives. \"I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s defensible,\" said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth\u00b4s Geisel School of Medicine. \"I\u00b4m extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the U.S. government would do that.\"\n\nIn a statement to Chinese media, a Sinovac spokeswoman also decried the U.S. military\u00b4s campaign. \"Stigmatizing vaccination will lead to a series of consequences, such as a lower inoculation rate, the outbreak and spread of disease, social panic and insecurity, as well as crises of confidence in science and public health,\" said Sinovac spokeswoman Yuan Youwei.\n\n(Reporting by Karen Lema in Manila and Chris Bing in Washington.

It aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China, a Reuters investigation found. Through phony internet accounts meant to impersonate Filipinos, the military's propaganda efforts morphed into an anti-vax campaign. Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines - China's Sinovac inoculation.\n\nReuters identified at least 300 accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that matched descriptions shared by former U.S. military officials familiar with the Philippines operation. Almost all were created in the summer of 2020 and centered on the slogan #Chinaangvirus - Tagalog for China is the virus.\n\n\"COVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don't trust China!\" one typical tweet from July 2020 read in Tagalog. The words were next to a photo of a syringe beside a Chinese flag and a soaring chart of infections. Another post read: \"From China - PPE, Face Mask, Vaccine: FAKE. But the Coronavirus is real.\"\n\nAfter Reuters asked X about the accounts, the social media company removed the profiles, determining they were part of a coordinated bot campaign based on activity patterns and internal data.\n\nThe U.S. military's anti-vax effort began in the spring of 2020 and expanded beyond Southeast Asia before it was terminated in mid-2021, Reuters determined. Tailoring the propaganda campaign to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East, the Pentagon used a combination of fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to spread fear of China's vaccines among Muslims at a time when the virus was killing tens of thousands of people each day. A key part of the strategy: amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China's shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law.\n\nThe military program started under former President Donald Trump and continued months into Joe Biden's presidency, Reuters found - even after alarmed social media executives warned the new administration that the Pentagon had been trafficking in COVID misinformation. The Biden White House issued an edict in spring 2021 banning the anti-vax effort, which also disparaged vaccines produced by other rivals, and the Pentagon initiated an internal review, Reuters found.\n\n\"I don't think it's defensible. I'm extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the U.S. government would do that.\"\n\nDaniel Lucey, infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine.\n\nThe U.S. military is prohibited from targeting Americans with propaganda, and Reuters found no evidence the Pentagon's influence operation did so.\n\nSpokespeople for Trump and Biden did not respond to requests for comment about the clandestine program.\n\nA senior Defense Department official acknowledged the U.S. military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage China's vaccine in the developing world, but the official declined to provide details.\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman said the U.S. military \"uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the U.S., allies, and partners.\" She also noted that China had started a \"disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nIn an email, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it has long maintained the U.S. government manipulates social media and spreads misinformation.\n\nManila's embassy in Washington did not respond to Reuters inquiries, including whether it had been aware of the Pentagon operation. A spokesperson for the Philippines Department of Health, however, said the \"findings by Reuters deserve to be investigated and heard by the appropriate authorities of the involved countries.\" Some aid workers in the Philippines, when told of the U.S. military propaganda effort by Reuters, expressed outrage.\n\nBriefed on the Pentagon's secret anti-vax campaign by Reuters, some American public health experts also condemned the program, saying it put civilians in jeopardy for potential geopolitical gain. An operation meant to win hearts and minds endangered lives, they said.\n\n\"I don't think it's defensible,\" said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. \"I'm extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the U.S. government would do that,\" said Lucey, a former military physician who assisted in the response to the 2001 anthrax attacks.\n\nThe effort to stoke fear about Chinese inoculations risked undermining overall public trust in government health initiatives, including U.S.-made vaccines that became available later, Lucey and others said. Although the Chinese vaccines were found to be less effective than the American-led shots by Pfizer and Moderna, all were approved by the World Health Organization. Sinovac did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nAcademic research published recently has shown that, when individuals develop skepticism toward a single vaccine, those doubts often lead to uncertainty about other inoculations. Lucey and other health experts say they saw such a scenario play out in Pakistan, where the Central Intelligence Agency used a fake hepatitis vaccination program in Abbottabad as cover to hunt for Osama bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind behind the attacks of September 11, 2001. Discovery of the ruse led to a backlash against an unrelated polio vaccination campaign, including attacks on healthcare workers, contributing to the re-emergence of the deadly disease in the country.\n\n\"It should have been in our interest to get as much vaccine in people's arms as possible,\" said Greg Treverton, former chairman of the U.S. National Intelligence Council, which coordinates the analysis and strategy of Washington's many spy agencies. What the Pentagon did, Treverton said, \"crosses a line.\"\n\n'We were desperate'\n\nTogether, the phony accounts used by the military had tens of thousands of followers during the program. Reuters could not determine how widely the anti-vax material and other Pentagon-planted disinformation was viewed, or to what extent the posts may have caused COVID deaths by dissuading people from getting vaccinated.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. propaganda efforts, however, then-Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte had grown so dismayed by how few Filipinos were willing to be inoculated that he threatened to arrest people who refused vaccinations.\n\n\"You choose, vaccine or I will have you jailed,\" a masked Duterte said in a televised address in June 2021. \"There is a crisis in this country ... I'm just exasperated by Filipinos not heeding the government.\"\n\nWhen he addressed the vaccination issue, the Philippines had among the worst inoculation rates in Southeast Asia. Only 2.1 million of its 114 million citizens were fully vaccinated - far short of the government's target of 70 million. By the time Duterte spoke, COVID cases exceeded 1.3 million, and almost 24,000 Filipinos had died from the virus. The difficulty in vaccinating the population contributed to the worst death rate in the region.\n\nA spokesperson for Duterte did not make the former president available for an interview.\n\nSome Filipino healthcare professionals and former officials contacted by Reuters were shocked by the U.S. anti-vax effort, which they say exploited an already vulnerable citizenry. Public concerns about a Dengue fever vaccine, rolled out in the Philippines in 2016, had led to broad skepticism toward inoculations overall, said Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination. The Pentagon campaign preyed on those fears.\n\n\"Why did you do it when people were dying? We were desperate,\" said Dr. Nina Castillo-Carandang, a former adviser to the World Health Organization and Philippines government during the pandemic. \"We don't have our own vaccine capacity,\" she noted, and the U.S. propaganda effort \"contributed even more salt into the wound.\"\n\nThe campaign also reinforced what one former health secretary called a longstanding suspicion of China, most recently because of aggressive behavior by Beijing in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Filipinos were unwilling to trust China's Sinovac, which first became available in the country in March 2021, said Esperanza Cabral, who served as health secretary under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Cabral said she had been unaware of the U.S. military's secret operation.\n\n\"I'm sure that there are lots of people who died from COVID who did not need to die from COVID,\" she said.\n\nTo implement the anti-vax campaign, the Defense Department overrode strong objections from top U.S. diplomats in Southeast Asia at the time, Reuters found. Sources involved in its planning and execution say the Pentagon, which ran the program through the military's psychological operations center in Tampa, Florida, disregarded the collateral impact that such propaganda may have on innocent Filipinos.\n\n\"We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective,\" said a senior military officer involved in the program. \"We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud.\"\n\nA new disinformation war\n\nIn uncovering the secret U.S. military operation, Reuters interviewed more than two dozen current and former U.S officials, military contractors, social media analysts and academic researchers. Reporters also reviewed Facebook, X and Instagram posts, technical data and documents about a set of fake social media accounts used by the U.S. military. Some were active for more than five years.\n\nClandestine psychological operations are among the government's most highly sensitive programs. Knowledge of their existence is limited to a small group of people within U.S. intelligence and military agencies. Such programs are treated with special caution because their exposure could damage foreign alliances or escalate conflict with rivals.\n\nOver the last decade, some U.S. national security officials have pushed for a return to the kind of aggressive clandestine propaganda operations against rivals that the United States' wielded during the Cold War. Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in which Russia used a combination of hacks and leaks to influence voters, the calls to fight back grew louder inside Washington.\n\nIn 2019, Trump authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to launch a clandestine campaign on Chinese social media aimed at turning public opinion in China against its government, Reuters reported in March. As part of that effort, a small group of operatives used bogus online identities to spread disparaging narratives about Xi Jinping's government.\n\nCOVID-19 galvanized the drive to wage psychological operations against China. One former senior Pentagon leader described the pandemic as a \"bolt of energy\" that finally ignited the long delayed counteroffensive against China's influence war.\n\nThe Pentagon's anti-vax propaganda came in response to China's own efforts to spread false information about the origins of COVID. The virus first emerged in China in late 2019. But in March 2020, Chinese government officials claimed without evidence that the virus may have been first brought to China by an American service member who participated in an international military sports competition in Wuhan the previous year. Chinese officials also suggested that the virus may have originated in a U.S. Army research facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland. There's no evidence for that assertion.\n\nMirroring Beijing's public statements, Chinese intelligence operatives set up networks of fake social media accounts to promote the Fort Detrick conspiracy, according to a U.S. Justice Department complaint.\n\nChina's messaging got Washington's attention. Trump subsequently coined the term \"China virus\" as a response to Beijing's accusation that the U.S. military exported COVID to Wuhan.\n\n\"That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said, 'I have to call it where it came from,'\" Trump said in a March 2020 news conference. \"It did come from China.\"\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said in an email that it opposed \"actions to politicize the origins question and stigmatize China.\" The ministry had no comment about the Justice Department's complaint.\n\nBeijing didn't limit its global influence efforts to propaganda. It announced an ambitious COVID assistance program, which included sending masks, ventilators and its own vaccines - still being tested at the time - to struggling countries. In May 2020, Xi announced that the vaccine China was developing would be made available as a \"global public good,\" and would ensure \"vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries.\" Sinovac was the primary vaccine available in the Philippines for about a year until U.S.-made vaccines became more widely available there in early 2022.\n\nWashington's plan, called Operation Warp Speed, was different. It favored inoculating Americans first, and it placed no restrictions on what pharmaceutical companies could charge developing countries for the remaining vaccines not used by the United States. The deal allowed the companies to \"play hardball\" with developing countries, forcing them to accept high prices, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University who has worked with the World Health Organization.\n\nThe deal \"sucked most of the supply out of the global market,\" Gostin said. \"The United States took a very determined America First approach.\"\n\nTo Washington's alarm, China's offers of assistance were tilting the geopolitical playing field across the developing world, including in the Philippines, where the government faced upwards of 100,000 infections in the early months of the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. relationship with Manila had grown tense after the 2016 election of the bombastic Duterte. A staunch critic of the United States, he had threatened to cancel a key pact that allows the U.S. military to maintain legal jurisdiction over American troops stationed in the country.\n\nDuterte said in a July 2020 speech he had made \"a plea\" to Xi that the Philippines be at the front of the line as China rolled out vaccines. He vowed in the same speech that the Philippines would no longer challenge Beijing's aggressive expansion in the South China Sea, upending a key security understanding Manila had long held with Washington.\n\n\"China is claiming it. We are claiming it. China has the arms, we do not have it.\" Duterte said. \"So, it is simple as that.\"\n\nDays later, China's foreign minister announced Beijing would grant Duterte's plea for priority access to the vaccine, as part of a \"new highlight in bilateral relations.\"\n\nChina's growing influence fueled efforts by U.S. military leaders to launch the secret propaganda operation Reuters uncovered.\n\n\"We didn't do a good job sharing vaccines with partners,\" a senior U.S. military officer directly involved in the campaign in Southeast Asia told Reuters. \"So what was left to us was to throw shade on China's.\"\n\nMilitary trumped diplomats\n\nU.S. military leaders feared that China's COVID diplomacy and propaganda could draw other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Malaysia, closer to Beijing, furthering its regional ambitions.\n\nA senior U.S. military commander responsible for Southeast Asia, Special Operations Command Pacific General Jonathan Braga, pressed his bosses in Washington to fight back in the so-called information space, according to three former Pentagon officials.\n\nThe commander initially wanted to punch back at Beijing in Southeast Asia. The goal: to ensure the region understood the origin of COVID while promoting skepticism toward what were then still-untested vaccines offered by a country that they said had lied continually since the start of the pandemic.\n\nA spokesperson for Special Operations Command declined to comment.\n\nAt least six senior State Department officials responsible for the region objected to this approach. A health crisis was the wrong time to instill fear or anger through a psychological operation, or psyop, they argued during Zoom calls with the Pentagon.\n\n\"We're stooping lower than the Chinese and we should not be doing that,\" said a former senior State Department official for the region who fought against the military operation.\n\nWhile the Pentagon saw Washington's rapidly diminishing influence in the Philippines as a call to action, the withering partnership led American diplomats to plead for caution.\n\n\"The relationship is hanging from a thread,\" another former senior U.S. diplomat recounted. \"Is this the moment you want to do a psyop in the Philippines? Is it worth the risk?\"\n\nIn the past, such opposition from the State Department might have proved fatal to the program. Previously in peacetime, the Pentagon needed approval of embassy officials before conducting psychological operations in a country, often hamstringing commanders seeking to quickly respond to Beijing's messaging, three former Pentagon officials told Reuters.\n\nBut in 2019, before COVID surfaced in full force, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper signed a secret order that later paved the way for the launch of the U.S. military propaganda campaign. The order elevated the Pentagon's competition with China and Russia to the priority of active combat, enabling commanders to sidestep the State Department when conducting psyops against those adversaries. The Pentagon spending bill passed by Congress that year also explicitly authorized the military to conduct clandestine influence operations against other countries, even \"outside of areas of active hostilities.\"\n\nEsper, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson referred questions to the Pentagon.\n\nU.S. propaganda machine\n\nIn spring 2020, special-ops commander Braga turned to a cadre of psychological-warfare soldiers and contractors in Tampa to counter Beijing's COVID efforts. Colleagues say Braga was a longtime advocate of increasing the use of propaganda operations in global competition. In trailers and squat buildings at a facility on Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base, U.S. military personnel and contractors would use anonymous accounts on X, Facebook and other social media to spread what became an anti-vax message. The facility remains the Pentagon's clandestine propaganda factory.\n\nPsychological warfare has played a role in U.S. military operations for more than a hundred years, although it has changed in style and substance over time. So-called psyopers were best known following World War II for their supporting role in combat missions across Vietnam, Korea and Kuwait, often dropping leaflets to confuse the enemy or encourage their surrender.\n\nAfter the al Qaeda attacks of 2001, the United States was fighting a borderless, shadowy enemy, and the Pentagon began to wage a more ambitious kind of psychological combat previously associated only with the CIA. The Pentagon set up front news outlets, paid off prominent local figures, and sometimes funded television soap operas in order to turn local populations against militant groups or Iranian-backed militias, former national security officials told Reuters.\n\nUnlike earlier psyop missions, which sought specific tactical advantage on the battlefield, the post-9/11 operations hoped to create broader change in public opinion across entire regions.\n\nBy 2010, the military began using social media tools, leveraging phony accounts to spread messages of sympathetic local voices - themselves often secretly paid by the United States government. As time passed, a growing web of military and intelligence contractors built online news websites to pump U.S.-approved narratives into foreign countries. Today, the military employs a sprawling ecosystem of social media influencers, front groups and covertly placed digital advertisements to influence overseas audiences, according to current and former military officials.\n\nChina's efforts to gain geopolitical clout from the pandemic gave Braga justification to launch the propaganda campaign that Reuters uncovered, sources said.\n\nPork in the vaccine?\n\nBy summer 2020, the military's propaganda campaign moved into new territory and darker messaging, ultimately drawing the attention of social media executives.\n\nIn regions beyond Southeast Asia, senior officers in the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia, launched their own version of the COVID psyop, three former military officials told Reuters.\n\nAlthough the Chinese vaccines were still months from release, controversy roiled the Muslim world over whether the vaccines contained pork gelatin and could be considered \"haram,\" or forbidden under Islamic law. Sinovac has said that the vaccine was \"manufactured free of porcine materials.\" Many Islamic religious authorities maintained that even if the vaccines did contain pork gelatin, they were still permissible since the treatments were being used to save human life.\n\nThe Pentagon campaign sought to intensify fears about injecting a pig derivative. As part of an internal investigation at X, the social media company used IP addresses and browser data to identify more than 150 phony accounts that were operated from Tampa by U.S. Central Command and its contractors, according to an internal X document reviewed by Reuters.\n\n\"Can you trust China, which tries to hide that its vaccine contains pork gelatin and distributes it in Central Asia and other Muslim countries where many people consider such a drug haram?\" read an April 2021 tweet sent from a military-controlled account identified by X.\n\nThe Pentagon also covertly spread its messages on Facebook and Instagram, alarming executives at parent company Meta who had long been tracking the military accounts, according to former military officials.\n\nOne military-created meme targeting Central Asia showed a pig made out of syringes, according to two people who viewed the image. Reuters found similar posts that traced back to U.S. Central Command. One shows a Chinese flag as a curtain separating Muslim women in hijabs and pigs stuck with vaccine syringes. In the center is a man with syringes; on his back is the word \"China.\" It targeted Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, a country that distributed tens of millions of doses of China's vaccines and participated in human trials. Translated into English, the X post reads: \"China distributes a vaccine made of pork gelatin.\"\n\nFacebook executives had first approached the Pentagon in the summer of 2020, warning the military that Facebook workers had easily identified the military's phony accounts, according to three former U.S. officials and another person familiar with the matter. The government, Facebook argued, was violating Facebook's policies by operating the bogus accounts and by spreading COVID misinformation.\n\nThe military argued that many of its fake accounts were being used for counterterrorism and asked Facebook not to take down the content, according to two people familiar with the exchange. The Pentagon pledged to stop spreading COVID-related propaganda, and some of the accounts continued to remain active on Facebook.\n\nNonetheless, the anti-vax campaign continued into 2021 as Biden took office.\n\nAngered that military officials had ignored their warning, Facebook officials arranged a Zoom meeting with Biden's new National Security Council shortly after the inauguration, Reuters learned. The discussion quickly became tense.\n\n\"It was terrible,\" said a senior administration official describing the reaction after learning of the campaign's pig-related posts. \"I was shocked. The administration was pro-vaccine and our concern was this could affect vaccine hesitancy, especially in developing countries.\"\n\nBy spring 2021, the National Security Council ordered the military to stop all anti-vaccine messaging. \"We were told we needed to be pro-vaccine, pro all vaccines,\" said a former senior military officer who helped oversee the program. Even so, Reuters found some anti-vax posts that continued through April and other deceptive COVID-related messaging that extended into that summer. Reuters could not determine why the campaign didn't end immediately with the NSC's order. In response to questions from Reuters, the NSC declined to comment.\n\nThe senior Defense Department official said that those complaints led to an internal review in late 2021, which uncovered the anti-vaccine operation. The probe also turned up other social and political messaging that was \"many, many leagues away\" from any acceptable military objective. The official would not elaborate.\n\nThe review intensified the following year, the official said, after a group of academic researchers at Stanford University flagged some of the same accounts as pro-Western bots in a public report. The high-level Pentagon review was first reported by the Washington Post. which also reported that the military used fake social media accounts to counter China's message that COVID came from the United States. But the Post report did not reveal that the program evolved into the anti-vax propaganda campaign uncovered by Reuters.\n\nThe senior defense official said the Pentagon has rescinded parts of Esper's 2019 order that allowed military commanders to bypass the approval of U.S. ambassadors when waging psychological operations. The rules now mandate that military commanders work closely with U.S. diplomats in the country where they seek to have an impact. The policy also restricts psychological operations aimed at \"broad population messaging,\" such as those used to promote vaccine hesitancy during COVID.\n\nThe Pentagon's audit concluded that the military's primary contractor handling the campaign, General Dynamics IT, had employed sloppy tradecraft, taking inadequate steps to hide the origin of the fake accounts, said a person with direct knowledge of the review. The review also found that military leaders didn't maintain enough control over its psyop contractors, the person said.\n\nA spokesperson for General Dynamics IT declined to comment.\n\nNevertheless, the Pentagon's clandestine propaganda efforts are set to continue. In an unclassified strategy document last year, top Pentagon generals wrote that the U.S. military could undermine adversaries such as China and Russia using \"disinformation spread across social media, false narratives disguised as news, and similar subversive activities [to] weaken societal trust by undermining the foundations of government.\"\n\nAnd in February, the contractor that worked on the anti-vax campaign - General Dynamics IT - won a $493 million contract. Its mission: to continue providing clandestine influence services for the military.\n\nfrom

It aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China, the Reuters investigation found. Through phony internet accounts meant to impersonate Filipinos, the military's propaganda efforts morphed into an anti-vax campaign. Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits, and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines - China's Sinovac inoculation, said the Reuters report.Reuters identified at least 300 accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, that matched descriptions shared by former US military officials familiar with the Philippines operation. Almost all were created in the summer of 2020 and centered on the slogan #Chinaangvirus - Tagalog for China is the virus. Additionally, the US military's anti-vax effort expanded beyond Southeast Asia before it was terminated in mid-2021, including in Central Asia and the Middle East, Reuters said.Sinovac's spokesperson Yuan Youwei told the Global Times that the company noticed the report and appreciated the fact that Reuters revealed the US military scheme to the public. Sinovac is a professional company with the goal of providing vaccines to eliminate diseases for humanity and to make a significant contribution to human health, said Yuan. \"Although we have overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still not peaceful. Sinovac hopes to continue safeguarding human health and well-being through disease prevention and control. We believe that every industry should focus on doing their own part, which is the right attitude.\"Public reports indicate that Sinovac's vaccines were among the first available for Filipino people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, China donated the first 600,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccines to Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Former Philippine president Duterte Rodrigo personally led cabinet members to greet this shipment, marking the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines received by the Philippines since the outbreak. Duterte said that this vaccine aid from China demonstrated the friendship and solidarity between the two countries.Citing three former US military officials, the Reuters report mentioned that the operation was pushed by then-Special Operations Command Pacific General Jonathan Braga, who was reportedly a longtime advocate of increasing the use of propaganda operations in global competition. The operation aimed to encourage local populations to question the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other aid provided by China.The report also believes that China's growing influence fueled efforts by US military leaders to launch the secret propaganda operation.Some Filipino healthcare professionals and former officials contacted by Reuters were shocked by the US anti-vax effort, which they say exploited an already vulnerable citizenry.To implement the anti-vax campaign, the US Defense Department overrode strong objections from top US diplomats in Southeast Asia at the time, Reuters found.Sources involved in its planning and execution say the Pentagon, which ran the program through the military's psychological operations center in Tampa, Florida, disregarded the collateral impact that such propaganda may have had on innocent Filipinos.\"We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective,\" said a senior military officer involved in the program, as per the Reuters repors. \"We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud.\"This article originally appeared on the Global Times website.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

The campaign also aimed to discredit masks and test kits made in China. \"Within the Pentagon, within Washington, there was this fear that they were going to lose the Philippines\" to Chinese influence, says Joel Schectman, one of the Reuters reporters who broke the story.

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nA new investigation by Reuters has revealed the U.S. military ran a secret anti-vaccination campaign at the height of the pandemic in the Philippines and other nations in an effort to sow doubt about COVID vaccines made by China. The clandestine Pentagon campaign began in 2020 under Donald Trump and continued into mid-2021 after President Biden took office. The Pentagon set up numerous fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to target audiences in the Philippines, Central Asia and the Middle East. The campaign also aimed to discredit masks and test kits made in China.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the secret operation was launched to counter what it perceived as China's growing influence in the Philippines and other countries. One senior military officer involved in the campaign told Reuters, \"We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective. We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud,\" they said.\n\nFor more, we're joined by the reporter who broke the story. Joel Schectman is an award-winning investigative journalist who's written for Reuters and The Wall Street Journal on national security, intelligence and cyber espionage. His recent Reuters piece is headlined \"Pentagon ran secret anti-vax campaign to undermine China during pandemic,\" joining us now from Washington, D,C.\n\nJoel, thanks so much for being with us. Lay out your major findings. I mean, this is just explosive, what you have discovered.\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: So, basically, what we found was that when COVID-19 broke out in January, February 2020, obviously, the entire world was not prepared for what was going to happen next. But in certain areas of the national security establishment in Washington, immediately they saw this through the kind of prism of this kind of new cold war with China, right? And the issue is that that had already been heating up. And there's this idea in Washington now that China and Russia have been just very successful with these kind of information operations, these kind of propaganda campaigns, of the type that the U.S. used to also do a lot during the Cold War. But there's this idea that Russia and China had really gotten ahead of the United States in the years since the Cold War. And, you know, in 2016, you have the hacking and leaking during the election to affect the outcome of the election. And there's this idea that China has really been, like, getting ahead in that sphere, as well, in, like, influencing allies and spreading misinformation.\n\nAnd that's the backdrop to what happened in 2020, where COVID breaks out, and then, immediately, or within a few months of the outbreak, China starts spinning this narrative that not only was COVID not created in China, but that it was actually brought to China by the United States military, that maybe it came out of Fort Detrick or maybe it came through a military service member who was participating in a sports competition there. But they start spreading that narrative, and it starts -- and, you know, from the Pentagon perspective, there was just this, like, tremendous anger that this narrative was starting to take hold in other -- in countries, you know, like the Philippines and Southeast Asia. And so they felt that they had to strike back.\n\nAnd the other thing that was going on at that period was that even in the early days of the pandemic, the U.S. was starting to come up with a vaccine response, but one that was going to really put, like, America first. It was a very, like, America-first vaccine policy, whereas very, very early in the pandemic, China came out publicly and said that it was going to try to make its vaccines publicly available in the developing world, right?\n\nAnd all of this starts to play out in the Philippines, which is a country that traditionally was a very close U.S. ally, right? And traditionally, it's a very close U.S. ally, but had started to move away under President Duterte, had started to move away from the United States and started to move toward China anyway. And then the pandemic breaks out, and Duterte cuts this deal with China that it's going to be first in line for China's vaccine that's under development. And at the same time, Duterte says, \"OK, I'm going to also get rid of these old U.S. military agreements that we have. They're no longer relevant.\" And so, within the Pentagon and within Washington, there was this fear that they were going to lose the Philippines, so to speak.\n\nAnd so they launched this secret propaganda campaign in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia to try to denigrate China's vaccine. And what made it particularly controversial, I think, or controversial now -- right? -- to look back at it in hindsight, is that it's not that U.S. was secretly -- not just that the U.S. was secretly denigrating a vaccine at the height of the COVID pandemic, which by itself is kind of problematic, but it was doing this at a time that no other vaccine was going to be available in the foreseeable future, right? Like, the United States's vaccines did not become widely available in the Philippines for like 10 months -- for 10 months after they got the Chinese one. So the Chinese one was really the only game in town in the Philippines for like almost the first year of -- for almost an entire year.\n\nAnd so, you know, you have Sinovac, which is really the only one that most Filipinos were able to access, and the Pentagon was using these kind of secret social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook to say that this vaccine was harmful, that it was dangerous, that it was at least ineffective, and that China caused the virus to start with, so, ergo, you know, how can he trust any vaccine that comes out of the country that created the virus itself, right? And they were using these kind of fake accounts that sort of purported to be Filipinos and trying to really stir up this message that, you know, I mean, what's your track record with Chinese products? Right? They're all fake, right? You know, what have you seen in your own life? You've seen that Chinese products are fake. How can you trust a country that always creates fake products to make a real vaccine? The vaccines are --\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is extremely significant, given how many people died in the Philippines of COVID without taking the vaccine. I mean, you have that quote in your piece. \"We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective. We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud,\" said one senior military officer. How many people died in the Philippines?\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Yeah. So, I'm trying to remember, like, by the end of the -- by the end of COVID, how many people passed away. But it was -- I mean, you're talking about a number that reached into -- you know, that reached far past the tens of thousands, right?\n\nAnd there's no question -- it's very hard to measure, like, the efficacy of a secret campaign like this and say, OK, how much did it move the needle. But I think if we judged it by its intentions -- right? -- like, the intention was to make people hesitant to take Sinovac -- there's no question that, to the degree that that was successful, it was incredibly harmful. There's all kinds of public health research in the Philippines that shows that vaccine hesitancy, specifically towards the Chinese vaccines, led to a large number of deaths, because, again, that was the only vaccine that was available from like February 2021 almost 'til early 2022. It wasn't the only one, but it was almost the only one, right? Like, it was the only one you could reliably get at that point in the country. And the fact that people were so afraid of taking that because of their history of sort of suspicion towards China really had like a very adverse impact. Now, it's hard to say exactly how much the Pentagon throwing fuel on that fire, like, how much of an impact that had. But if you judge it by its intentions, to whatever degree they were successful with their intentions, it was incredibly harmful.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You suggest, toward the end of your piece, Joel, that there is a kind of broader move underway within the U.S. military to get more involved in clandestine propaganda to undermine adversaries like China and Russia -- both of these countries, of course, criticized by the U.S. precisely for deploying these methods. Can you explain?\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Yeah. So, like I was mentioning earlier, there is this idea that the U.S. has been flat-footed in sort of responding to Chinese and Russian covert propaganda efforts. And there's this idea that, you know, we've been like a little bit too hesitant, a little too kind of moralistic in our response. And as a result, we've kind of, like, ceded this sort of information space battlefield to them. There's this idea that we need to kind of fight fire with fire, the United States needs to take the fight back to the adversary in that realm, and that it needs to envision psyops, as they call them, as having a much bigger role in sort of shifting the -- you know, kind of shifting the political dynamic -- right? -- that psyops, their role is not just in a hot, like, war, dropping leaflets, encouraging surrender, but it really needs to be part of this kind of ideological battle and potentially be used to kind of undermine civil society within, like -- you know, within our adversaries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Your piece concludes by noting that General Dynamics IT, which worked on the anti-vax campaign, just won a contract worth almost $500 million, half a billion dollars, to, quote, \"continue providing clandestine influence services for the military.\" Explain.\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Yeah. So, General Dynamics -- there's a lot of different, like, aspects of these psychological operations -- right? -- because it's not just online. But for the online part of it, General Dynamics was responsible for the largest Pentagon contract that was involved in this kind of anti-vaccine, kind of COVID propaganda. They were the ones that were kind of running the accounts. Them or their subcontractors, I should say, were running the accounts, running the propaganda during that period.\n\nAnd they actually got into a lot of hot water, not so much just because of, like, you know, the kind of moral elements of this, or the ethical elements that we're discussing, but more because they really got caught, right? Like, the accounts were discovered by the social media companies. Like, the tradecraft they used to disguise themselves was very poor. And so they got into a lot of trouble. And people in that world were, like, kind of shocked on that basis for why they would get, like, another contract so soon after to do the same thing, you know, when they were discovered kind of repeatedly and called out repeatedly just like a year ago or two years ago.\n\nSo, going forward, my understanding is that they're going to continue to be the prime or like the main contractor behind these kind of clandestine online kind of propaganda operations, these online --\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Right, psyops, psychological operations. You're talking about setting up fake sites.\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Fake websites, fake accounts, you know, fake social media accounts, like Twitter, sock puppets, if you will, to kind of amplify these propaganda lines in countries that the U.S. is in competition with.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Joel Schectman, award-winning investigative reporter who has written for Reuters and The Wall Street Journal on national security, intelligence and cyber espionage. We'll link to your Reuters piece -- now you're going to The Wall Street Journal, but to your Reuters piece, \"Pentagon ran secret anti-vax campaign to undermine China during pandemic.\"\n\nNext up, President Biden announces an executive action to streamline the path to citizenship for some half a million people married to American citizens but lack legal status.

The US Military used fake online accounts impersonating Filipinos, which decried the quality of face masks, test kits and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines - China's Sinovac inoculation.\n\nReuters identified at least 300 accounts on X that matched descriptions shared by former US military officials familiar with the Philippines operation. Almost all of these accounts were created in the summer of 2020 and centered on the slogan #Chinaangvirus - Tagalog for China is the virus.\n\n\"COVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don't trust China!\" one typical tweet from July 2020 read in Tagalog. The words were next to a photo of a syringe beside a Chinese flag and a soaring chart of infections. Another post read: \"From China - PPE, Face Mask, Vaccine: FAKE. But the Coronavirus is real.\"\n\nX removed the fake profiles after Reuters informed the company, due to them being a part of a bot campaign.\n\nThe secret anti-vax effort started back in early 2020 and expanded beyond Southeast Asia before it was terminated in mid-2021. The campaign tailored the exact propaganda for each local audience, across central Asia and the Middle East. A key part of the strategy was to amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China's shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law.\n\nThe secret program started under President Trump and continued months into Joe Biden's presidency, even after alarmed social media executives warned the Biden administration that the Pentagon had been trafficking in COVID misinformation. Biden's administration stopped the campaign in the spring of 2021, and the Pentagon initiated an internal review, Reuters found.\n\nThe US military is prohibited from targeting Americans with propaganda. The Reuters report found no evidence the Pentagon's influence operation targeted any Americans.\n\nSpokespeople for Trump and Biden did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA senior Defense Department official acknowledged that the US military did engage in secret propaganda to disparage China's vaccine in the developing world.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pentagon said the US military \"uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the US, allies, and partners.\" She also noted that China had started a \"disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nClandestine psychological operations are among the US government's most highly sensitive programs.

The following is the full transcript.\n\nQ\uff1aOn June 14\u2002a Reuters investigation reported\u2002that at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2002the U.S. military launched a secret psychological operation\u2002to counter\u2002China's growing influence in the Philippines, using social media accounts to impersonate Filipinos and spread disinformation about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid\u2002supplied by China. It\u2002sowed distrust and fear of the Chinese vaccines\u2002in the Filipinos, leading the Philippines\u2002to have\u2002among the worst inoculation rates in Southeast Asia. The difficulty in vaccinating the\u2002Filipino\u2002population contributed to the worst death rate in the region.\u2002By June 2021\u2002almost 24,000 Filipinos had died from the virus. Many people in the Philippines called\u2002for the Philippine government and Congress to investigate into this\u2002reported secret disinformation campaign targeted against the Filipinos. What is the embassy's comment on this?\n\nA:\u2002As a responsible major country, China provided global public goods\u2002such as vaccines to other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were the first to provide COVID response supplies\u2002and vaccines to the Philippines. China and the Philippines have been mutually supportive and cooperative against the onslaught of the disease, making important contributions to the world's final victory over the pandemic. However, such cooperation was not as smooth as it was supposed to be. Obstruction and sabotage from a third country and certain\u2002forces happened all along. Of course such a plot doomed to failure as it went against the interests of the Chinese and Filipino peoples. More and more behind-the-scene stories were told by insiders\u2002since the end of the pandemic. The above-mentioned\u2002report is one of latest that connects the dots and tells the true picture\u2002to the world.\n\nPeople\u2002around the world\u2002are indignant about the US military's actions which lay bare the hypocrisy, malign intention\u2002and double standards of the United States. While talking about respecting human rights, the United States does just the opposite regarding\u2002the fundamental human rights of\u2002life and health of the Filipino people. The United States reaffirms\u2002the so-called ironclad commitment to its allies all the time, but when it comes to the critical moment of fighting the epidemic together, it is always America First, exploiting the vulnerability of the Filipino people for its ulterior geopolitical motives. By denying access to Chinese assistance, and in defiance of the global public opinion, the United States dares to spread rumors and spin stories\u2002on major global public health issues including the vaccine.\n\nA country that loses its credibility would falter just like a deceitful person. We hope that the US will behave the way it claims to be, and stop fabricating and spreading disinformation against other countries. It is expected to\u2002shoulder responsibility of a major country, truly respect the effort of other countries in safeguarding people's health, well being and peace and stability of the region.\n\nQ: Reuters also reported\u2002that the U.S. military's secret disinformation campaign is continuing around\u2002the world. Some commentators pointed out\u2002that if\u2002the US launched\u2002such\u2002a secret disinformation\u2002campaign to discredit Chinese vaccines\u2002during the COVID-19 pandemic, it could well have and is running\u2002another round to portray China as a \"bully\"\u2002in the South China Sea. What is the embassy's comment on this?\n\nA:\u2002We have noticed these comments. People of both China and the Philippines should remain highly vigilant\u2002and\u2002clear-eyed, resist being taken in by\u2002disinformation and inflammatory rhetoric, define their own fate and protect China-Philippines relations as well as peace and stability in the South China Sea.", "source": {"uri": "ecns.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News \u4e2d\u56fd\u65b0\u95fb\u7f51"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inoculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Philippines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 14}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661277", "eventUri": "eng-9661277", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 236}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The campaign also aimed to discredit masks and test kits made in China. \"Within the Pentagon, within Washington, there was this fear that they were going to lose the Philippines\" to Chinese influence, says Joel Schectman, one of the Reuters reporters who broke the story. Schectman says that while it's impossible to measure the impact of the propaganda effort, it came at a time when the Chinese-made Sinovac shot was the only one available in the Philippines, making distrust of the vaccine \"incredibly harmful.\"\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nA new investigation by Reuters has revealed the U.S. military ran a secret anti-vaccination campaign at the height of the pandemic in the Philippines and other nations in an effort to sow doubt about COVID vaccines made by China. The clandestine Pentagon campaign began in 2020 under Donald Trump and continued into mid-2021 after President Biden took office. The Pentagon set up numerous fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to target audiences in the Philippines, Central Asia and the Middle East. The campaign also aimed to discredit masks and test kits made in China.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the secret operation was launched to counter what it perceived as China's growing influence in the Philippines and other countries. One senior military officer involved in the campaign told Reuters, \"We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective. We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud,\" they said.\n\nFor more, we're joined by the reporter who broke the story. Joel Schectman is an award-winning investigative journalist who's written for Reuters and The Wall Street Journal on national security, intelligence and cyber espionage. His recent Reuters piece is headlined \"Pentagon ran secret anti-vax campaign to undermine China during pandemic,\" joining us now from Washington, D,C.\n\nJoel, thanks so much for being with us. Lay out your major findings. I mean, this is just explosive, what you have discovered.\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: So, basically, what we found was that when COVID-19 broke out in January, February 2020, obviously, the entire world was not prepared for what was going to happen next. But in certain areas of the national security establishment in Washington, immediately they saw this through the kind of prism of this kind of new cold war with China, right? And the issue is that that had already been heating up. And there's this idea in Washington now that China and Russia have been just very successful with these kind of information operations, these kind of propaganda campaigns, of the type that the U.S. used to also do a lot during the Cold War. But there's this idea that Russia and China had really gotten ahead of the United States in the years since the Cold War. And, you know, in 2016, you have the hacking and leaking during the election to affect the outcome of the election. And there's this idea that China has really been, like, getting ahead in that sphere, as well, in, like, influencing allies and spreading misinformation.\n\nAnd that's the backdrop to what happened in 2020, where COVID breaks out, and then, immediately, or within a few months of the outbreak, China starts spinning this narrative that not only was COVID not created in China, but that it was actually brought to China by the United States military, that maybe it came out of Fort Detrick or maybe it came through a military service member who was participating in a sports competition there. But they start spreading that narrative, and it starts -- and, you know, from the Pentagon perspective, there was just this, like, tremendous anger that this narrative was starting to take hold in other -- in countries, you know, like the Philippines and Southeast Asia. And so they felt that they had to strike back.\n\nAnd the other thing that was going on at that period was that even in the early days of the pandemic, the U.S. was starting to come up with a vaccine response, but one that was going to really put, like, America first. It was a very, like, America-first vaccine policy, whereas very, very early in the pandemic, China came out publicly and said that it was going to try to make its vaccines publicly available in the developing world, right?\n\nAnd all of this starts to play out in the Philippines, which is a country that traditionally was a very close U.S. ally, right? And traditionally, it's a very close U.S. ally, but had started to move away under President Duterte, had started to move away from the United States and started to move toward China anyway. And then the pandemic breaks out, and Duterte cuts this deal with China that it's going to be first in line for China's vaccine that's under development. And at the same time, Duterte says, \"OK, I'm going to also get rid of these old U.S. military agreements that we have. They're no longer relevant.\" And so, within the Pentagon and within Washington, there was this fear that they were going to lose the Philippines, so to speak.\n\nAnd so they launched this secret propaganda campaign in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia to try to denigrate China's vaccine. And what made it particularly controversial, I think, or controversial now -- right? -- to look back at it in hindsight, is that it's not that U.S. was secretly -- not just that the U.S. was secretly denigrating a vaccine at the height of the COVID pandemic, which by itself is kind of problematic, but it was doing this at a time that no other vaccine was going to be available in the foreseeable future, right? Like, the United States's vaccines did not become widely available in the Philippines for like 10 months -- for 10 months after they got the Chinese one. So the Chinese one was really the only game in town in the Philippines for like almost the first year of -- for almost an entire year.\n\nAnd so, you know, you have Sinovac, which is really the only one that most Filipinos were able to access, and the Pentagon was using these kind of secret social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook to say that this vaccine was harmful, that it was dangerous, that it was at least ineffective, and that China caused the virus to start with, so, ergo, you know, how can he trust any vaccine that comes out of the country that created the virus itself, right? And they were using these kind of fake accounts that sort of purported to be Filipinos and trying to really stir up this message that, you know, I mean, what's your track record with Chinese products? Right? They're all fake, right? You know, what have you seen in your own life? You've seen that Chinese products are fake. How can you trust a country that always creates fake products to make a real vaccine? The vaccines are --\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is extremely significant, given how many people died in the Philippines of COVID without taking the vaccine. I mean, you have that quote in your piece. \"We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective. We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud,\" said one senior military officer. How many people died in the Philippines?\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Yeah. So, I'm trying to remember, like, by the end of the -- by the end of COVID, how many people passed away. But it was -- I mean, you're talking about a number that reached into -- you know, that reached far past the tens of thousands, right?\n\nAnd there's no question -- it's very hard to measure, like, the efficacy of a secret campaign like this and say, OK, how much did it move the needle. But I think if we judged it by its intentions -- right? -- like, the intention was to make people hesitant to take Sinovac -- there's no question that, to the degree that that was successful, it was incredibly harmful. There's all kinds of public health research in the Philippines that shows that vaccine hesitancy, specifically towards the Chinese vaccines, led to a large number of deaths, because, again, that was the only vaccine that was available from like February 2021 almost 'til early 2022. It wasn't the only one, but it was almost the only one, right? Like, it was the only one you could reliably get at that point in the country. And the fact that people were so afraid of taking that because of their history of sort of suspicion towards China really had like a very adverse impact. Now, it's hard to say exactly how much the Pentagon throwing fuel on that fire, like, how much of an impact that had. But if you judge it by its intentions, to whatever degree they were successful with their intentions, it was incredibly harmful.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You suggest, toward the end of your piece, Joel, that there is a kind of broader move underway within the U.S. military to get more involved in clandestine propaganda to undermine adversaries like China and Russia -- both of these countries, of course, criticized by the U.S. precisely for deploying these methods. Can you explain?\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Yeah. So, like I was mentioning earlier, there is this idea that the U.S. has been flat-footed in sort of responding to Chinese and Russian covert propaganda efforts. And there's this idea that, you know, we've been like a little bit too hesitant, a little too kind of moralistic in our response. And as a result, we've kind of, like, ceded this sort of information space battlefield to them. There's this idea that we need to kind of fight fire with fire, the United States needs to take the fight back to the adversary in that realm, and that it needs to envision psyops, as they call them, as having a much bigger role in sort of shifting the -- you know, kind of shifting the political dynamic -- right? -- that psyops, their role is not just in a hot, like, war, dropping leaflets, encouraging surrender, but it really needs to be part of this kind of ideological battle and potentially be used to kind of undermine civil society within, like -- you know, within our adversaries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Your piece concludes by noting that General Dynamics IT, which worked on the anti-vax campaign, just won a contract worth almost $500 million, half a billion dollars, to, quote, \"continue providing clandestine influence services for the military.\" Explain.\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Yeah. So, General Dynamics -- there's a lot of different, like, aspects of these psychological operations -- right? -- because it's not just online. But for the online part of it, General Dynamics was responsible for the largest Pentagon contract that was involved in this kind of anti-vaccine, kind of COVID propaganda. They were the ones that were kind of running the accounts. Them or their subcontractors, I should say, were running the accounts, running the propaganda during that period.\n\nAnd they actually got into a lot of hot water, not so much just because of, like, you know, the kind of moral elements of this, or the ethical elements that we're discussing, but more because they really got caught, right? Like, the accounts were discovered by the social media companies. Like, the tradecraft they used to disguise themselves was very poor. And so they got into a lot of trouble. And people in that world were, like, kind of shocked on that basis for why they would get, like, another contract so soon after to do the same thing, you know, when they were discovered kind of repeatedly and called out repeatedly just like a year ago or two years ago.\n\nSo, going forward, my understanding is that they're going to continue to be the prime or like the main contractor behind these kind of clandestine online kind of propaganda operations, these online --\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Right, psyops, psychological operations. You're talking about setting up fake sites.\n\nJOEL SCHECTMAN: Fake websites, fake accounts, you know, fake social media accounts, like Twitter, sock puppets, if you will, to kind of amplify these propaganda lines in countries that the U.S. is in competition with.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Joel Schectman, award-winning investigative reporter who has written for Reuters and The Wall Street Journal on national security, intelligence and cyber espionage. We'll link to your Reuters piece -- now you're going to The Wall Street Journal, but to your Reuters piece, \"Pentagon ran secret anti-vax campaign to undermine China during pandemic.\"\n\nNext up, President Biden announces an executive action to streamline the path to citizenship for some half a million people married to American citizens but lack legal status.

It is expected to shoulder responsibility of a major country, truly respect the effort of other countries in safeguarding people's health, well-being and peace and stability of the region,\" the statement said.\n\nSome commentators in the Philippines pointed out that if the United States launched such a secret disinformation campaign to discredit Chinese vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, it could well be running another round to portray China as a \"bully\" in the South China Sea.\n\nIn response to such remarks, the Chinese embassy in the Philippines said that the Chinese and Filipino people \"should remain highly vigilant and clear-eyed, resist being taken in by disinformation and inflammatory rhetoric, define their own fate and protect China-Philippines relations as well as peace and stability in the South China Sea.\" \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nBy Dan Steinbock\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US military launched a secret campaign to discredit China's Sinovac inoculation and to counter what it perceived as China's growing influence in the Philippines, according to a new Reuters investigation.\n\nAccording to a new Reuters investigation, the clandestine operation hit the Philippines which had been hit particularly hard by the virus. I should know. I was in Metro Manila at the time.\n\nIn 2020, I released two reports on the pandemic and its international human and economic costs. The situation was particularly dire in the Philippines. I took the Sinovac shot twice and talked with some who were afraid to do so and chose to wait. Since then, I have wondered what happened to them.\n\nUS troll farms against Chinese Sinovac\n\nThe covert US military operation was particularly harmful because, as Reuters put it, \"it aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China.\"\n\nHow did it happen? Fake internet accounts impersonating Filipinos and used by US military's propaganda were transformed into an anti-vax campaign. As Filipino public health officials struggled to contain the epidemic, the covert operation morphed social media posts into troll farms decrying the quality of face masks, test kits and especially the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines - China's Sinovac inoculation.\n\nReuters identified 300 accounts on X (Twitter) matching descriptions shared by former US military officials familiar with the Philippines operation. They urged Filipinos \"not to trust the China vax, which was a \"rat killer\" and so on.\n\nThe origins of the US operation went back to the pre-pandemic 2019, when Trump's defense secretary Mark Esper signed a secret order paving the way to the launch of the campaign. As Pentagon's \"competition\" with China was identified with \"active combat,\" it enabled the military to bypass the State Department in its psychological warfare (psyop) operations. Ironically, that year, Esper was shaking hands in the Philippines with his counterpart Delfin Lorenzana; a meeting that was later linked with pledges of quick vax delivery and military cooperation, as reflected by a Rappler report.", "source": {"uri": "bbs.chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbs.chinadaily.com.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinovac_Biotech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sinovac Biotech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoronaVac", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CoronaVac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troll farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inoculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro Manila"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine hesitancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Esper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Esper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delfin_Lorenzana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delfin Lorenzana"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661277", "eventUri": "eng-9661277", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

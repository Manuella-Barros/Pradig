{"id": 231314116, "title": "Scottish distillery launches limited-edition whisky 'perfect' for Father\u2019s Day", "text": "A popular Scottish whisky distillery has unveiled a limited-edition release just in time for Father\u2019s Day. Benromach Distillery in Speyside has launched a new 10-year-old single malt whisky matured in Virgin American Oak casks. Benromach Contrasts Virgin Oak marks the latest addition to its Contrasts range, which includes whiskies designed as a twist on the delicately smoky profile of the distillery's core range. The unseasoned casks featured in the new release were handmade by expert coopers in Speyside. They were then gently charred, before being filled with Benromach's signature subtly smoky spirit. The result is a fragrant whisky with an ABV strength of 46 per cent. Notes of dried banana, lemon, and fudge hit the nose, while the taste is centred around Seville orange zest flavours combined with butterscotch and smooth smoke \u2014 finishing with long-lasting citrus. Distillery Manager at Benromach Keith Cruickshank commented: \"Every drop of this single malt whisky is made by hand using the sharpened senses of our distillers who put their heart and soul into creating our whisky. \"Having matured for ten years in Virgin American Oak casks, the result is liquid that is packed with fruity aromas from the offset, followed by zesty citrus and sweet butterscotch flavours. It\u2019s a cracking dram. \"With a limited number of bottles available for purchase, this is the perfect dram for whisky enthusiasts looking to explore something a bit different \u2014 the perfect present for Father\u2019s Day.\" Benromach Contrasts Virgin Oak is currently available for purchase via independent whisky specialists at a recommended retail price of \u00a360. More information can be found on the Benromach Distillery website. Meanwhile, you can shop the Contrasts range at Master of Malt.

{"id": 225054476, "title": "Europe\u2019s big summer: how the Guardian is gearing up for a seismic season across the continent", "text": "Europe\u2019s going to be big news this summer. Big news deserves a big response and from the Guardian, it will get it. In early June, elections for the European parliament are expected to bring a surge in support for populist, far-right and nationalist parties. The results could end up changing the face \u2013 and direction \u2013 of the EU. Later that month, one of the world\u2019s great sporting events, the men\u2019s football European Championships (AKA the Euros) kicks off in Germany, with 22 other teams out to beat the bookies\u2019 favourites: France and \u2013 unusually \u2013 England. Another big summer election in Europe will take place on 4 July, when people in the UK head out to vote in a general election. If the polls are correct, the country could well end 14 years of chaotic rule by the Conservatives \u2013 a period that, of course, included the tumult of the Brexit referendum and its aftermath. Later in July is the start of the biggest sporting spectacle of them all, the summer Olympics and Paralympics: 15,000 athletes from 200-plus delegations and more than 13 million spectators are expected to converge on Paris for the biggest event France has ever organised. Beyond the sporting events in the capital, our correspondents in France will look at the social, cultural and political reaction to the games in a nation that faced a wave of unrest in the summer of 2023. On top of all that, of course, will come a flow of news we call \u201cregular\u201d but which is, in fact, anything but \u2013 including Russia\u2019s brutal war on Ukraine, and a climate crisis likely to produce another summer of record-breaking European heatwaves and wildfires. The only reason we\u2019re able to provide such distinctive coverage of all these huge news events is because of backing from our readers. If you think our journalism is important, please consider supporting us today. Last September we launched our Europe edition, a new digital destination for readers in continental Europe who seek progressive, independent journalism and informed opinion on Europe. The journalism produced by this team also means we can share more fascinating stories and great ideas for living with our readers around the world. Guardian Europe is a project many years in the making. We have always had a strong commitment to the continent, but last September we went a big step further to make our new standalone digital edition happen \u2013 and it has already become a big success. In addition to correspondents in a dozen capitals, we now have specialist European writers on arts and culture, sports, community affairs and the environment, plus a dedicated Europe liveblogger and an expert, insightful (and fun) new roster of European columnists. All that has already had an impact. European readers were always among our most engaged readers outside the UK; there are now many more of them, and they are even more engaged. They read the news, of course, but our data shows they also really like the Guardian\u2019s sports and, particularly, cultural coverage. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re finding stories about Europe are resonating far beyond the continent, introducing people around the world to European ways of doing things \u2013 such as suicide prevention in Finland, EVs in Norway, and drug decriminalisation in Portugal. I\u2019ve worked for the Guardian in Europe since 1993, based in Amsterdam, Helsinki, Brussels and (mostly) Paris, with a stint in London in between. I\u2019ve reported from almost every EU member state. In 30 years, the change in how the Guardian sees Europe \u2013 and how Europe sees us \u2013 has been astonishing. It boils down, I think, to the notion that unlike almost all British and US media, we do not see and report Europe through an Anglo-American prism. Britain may not be in the EU any more, but the Guardian has never been more European. And that means that this summer we will bring you fast, informed reporting and considered, authoritative analysis of elections in which far-right and anti-green-agenda parties could finish first in nine countries and second or third in another nine. Our expert (and always entertaining) sports writers will crisscross Germany to cover all 51 matches of Euro 24, as well as liveblogging and podcasting throughout, while our Olympics and Paralympics coverage will be every bit as exhaustive. If you appreciate our coverage and believe in the importance of a free and independent press, please consider backing the Guardian today. Your support helps fund everything we do \u2013 and we\u2019d love to have you on board. Thank you.

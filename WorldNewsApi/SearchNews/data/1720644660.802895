On a sun-dappled Friday evening in Edinburgh, Taylor Swift\u2019s record-breaking Eras Tour landed in the UK. All around the city, local businesses got into the spirit of Swiftmania. Hotel lobbies were decorated with balloons, streamers, and cardboard cutouts of the US singer. On every corner, hit singles such as the wistful synth-pop of \u201cAll You Had to Do Was Stay\u201d and the defiant bop \u201cShake It Off\u201d were blasted from pub speakers. Over a year since the opening concert in Arizona, Swift, 34, finally touched down in the UK, for the first of three nights at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh where hundreds of fans had camped the night before as they vied for a spot in front of the stage. Along the route, vendors flogged pink cowboy hats, feather boas, and heart-shaped sunglasses. Outside the venue, however, Swifties were already donning their best outfits that often referenced one of the pop star\u2019s various \u201ceras\u201d. There were shades of bright scarlet and deep crimson paying homage to Swift\u2019s 2012 record, Red, while others dressed in dark glittering indigo and lavender in a nod to 2022\u2019s Midnights. Soft pastel tones and sequins represented her hit album Lover, while her twin records Folklore and Evermore inspired swathes of white lace and earthy colours in the crowd. Speaking to The Independent ahead of the show, Hannah, 33, said she had travelled from Texas to see Swift, citing cheaper tickets and her \u201cvery wonderful boyfriend\u201d. It was the first time she would be seeing the singer live. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cEveryone is so kind, it feels like family. It\u2019s the most welcoming atmosphere you could imagine.\u201d Tom, 28, from Edinburgh, fell in love with Swift\u2019s music a few years ago, after hearing the dreamy, Eighties-influenced \u201cStyle\u201d. He stood outside the stadium wearing a hot pink cowboy hat, grinning as fans filtered past. \u201cThis is my first show,\u201d he said. \u201cI came on my own, I literally bought a ticket last minute today. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here.\u201d The frenzy over Swift\u2019s show has drawn comparisons to Beatlemania, with attention this time directed not at a Fab Four but at the lone figure who strode out onto the stage in her shimmering sequined bodysuit. Beaming, Swift launched into a dazzling opening salvo comprising songs from her 2019 record Lover. \u201cWe\u2019ve checked this about 20 times,\u201d she said, addressing her adoring audience, \u201cand this is the biggest stadium in Scottish history.\u201d 73,000 fans screamed their approval. \u201cEdinburgh, you\u2019ve made us feel so welcome.\u201d The atmosphere was nothing short of electric. This far into the tour, most fans were well acquainted with not just the material, but all of Swift\u2019s moves: every wink, every wave, every hair flick. They sang along to the bridge of \u201cCruel Summer\u201d without missing a beat and roared \u201cf*** the patriarchy\u201d on the 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d. As she clambered down from her to-scale treehouse, Swift congratulated a couple who got engaged during her performance of \u201cCardigan\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t usually get to see those,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you for getting engaged at my show!\u201d She kept an eye out for fans who might have become overwhelmed or dehydrated. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep doing this until [security] know where I\u2019m looking at,\u201d she said, aiming her guitar to a spot in the crowd during the acoustic segment of her tour. Moments later, her hand froze during a rendition of \u201cWould\u2019ve, Could\u2019ve, Should\u2019ve\u201d, and Swift quite literally had to \u201cShake It Off\u201d. \u201cThis is so embarrassing,\u201d she told fans as she appeared to wrestle with cramp. \u201cI must have done this a million times and my hand has never formed a claw before.\u201d Even before Swift kicked off her Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, in March last year, the pop star\u2019s mammoth stadium show \u2013 spanning her full catalogue and comprising nearly two decades\u2019 worth of hits \u2013 had already generated headlines around the world. It even sparked a minor diplomatic row in southeast Asia. Last month, it was predicted that this UK leg could generate close to a \u00a31bn boost for the economy, as politicians scrambled to confirm their allegiance. London mayor Sadiq Khan declared himself a \u201cproud Swiftie\u201d to The Independent, as he expressed his excitement over welcoming the pop titan to the capital in August. Swift\u2019s prolificity over the past five years has ensured that she continues to dominate headlines like no other artist. Since the surprise release of twin albums Folklore and Evermore \u2013 conceived after she was forced to cancel her Lover tour due to onset of the pandemic \u2013 she has barely paused for breath. She triumphed at the 2021 Grammy Awards, making history as the first woman to win Album of the Year three times. Next, she released two of her album re-recordings, Red and Fearless, with each billed as \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d as part of her ongoing bid to reclaim the rights to her masters \u2013 following a public row with controversial music mogul Scooter Braun. Then came Midnights, the 2022 album produced with frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff, securing yet another history-making achievement \u2013 the first artist in history to win four Grammys for Album of the Year. Which brought us to her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, announced as Swift collected yet another Grammy at the ceremony in Los Angeles, and released on 19 April. Widely believed to be about her brief dalliance with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy, as well as her split from her boyfriend of six years, British actor Joe Alwyn, it polarised critics (The Independent\u2019s Helen Brown awarded it five stars). Yet naysayers didn\u2019t impede Swift\u2019s shattering of myriad chart and streaming records. \u201cI think it takes a few weeks to grow on you,\u201d fan Isla said, defending the record from negative reviews during the concert. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s one of her best albums.\u201d After the show, when the final burst of fireworks had drifted into smoke, Swifties lingered in the stadium, flushed, beaming and awestruck, or else made the dash for the first tram outside, shivering in their dresses. \u201cI grew up listening to her in elementary school, so this is a special moment,\u201d Sarah, 35, said, revealing she\u2019d come from Toronto, Canada. \u201cHer music has been a part of my whole childhood, my youth, and now my adulthood. She means everything to me.\u201d Sarah also praised the Scottish fans, saying they \u201cliked to party a little harder\u201d than Canadian Swifties. \u201cThey\u2019ve got incredible energy, everyone\u2019s just so much fun,\u201d she said. Joseph, 24, who was dressed in head-to-toe pink sequins, had come from Aberdeen on his own. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for years to see her live, and she was even better than I thought she\u2019d be,\u201d he said. Swift\u2019s music from her Folklore and Evermore eras meant the most to him, he said, as his grandmother died during the pandemic and those songs reminded him of her. Katrina attended the concert with her 10-year-old daughter, Tamsin, who got to see Swift for the first time. \u201cI really wanted to hear her do \u2018Cardigan\u2019 live, because that\u2019s my favourite,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she\u2019s the best singer in the world.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The Independent spoke to fans who had journeyed from as far as Texas and Toronto for Taylor\u2019s first UK Eras tour show </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-edinburgh-setlist-eras-tour-b2559152.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/07/23/newFile-4.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6JjyWM5R-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:25:50", "author": "Roisin O'Connor", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.476}

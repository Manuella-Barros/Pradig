Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats.\n\nIt is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest parliamentary group - in this case the NFP - and ask it to form a government.\n\nBut Macron and his Ensemble allies have repeatedly refused to enter into coalition with the far-left France Unbowed, the largest single party within the NFP, and have accused its leader, the 72-year-old firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of being just as extreme and unfit to govern as figures on the far right.\n\nThe NFP formed days after Macron called the snap vote, and chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. After tactical voting and political bargaining between centrist and left-wing voters, the NFP managed the same feat in Sunday's second round.\n\nBut the NFP does not speak with a single voice. The various parties in the coalition straddle vast ideological ground, from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Place Publique and Socialist parties. When the shock result was announced, each party celebrated separately, and the bloc still has not nominated a leader to become prime minister.\n\nM\u00e9lenchon has stated his intention to govern France. In a victory speech Sunday evening near Stalingrad Square in Paris, he said Macron \"has the duty\" to ask the NFP to form a government.\n\nUnlike its neighbors Italy and Germany, France - with its presidential system - lacks the culture of coalition-building and compromise, meaning the formation of a new government could take weeks and prove fleeting.\n\nNewly-elected members of parliament, called \"deputies,\" are scheduled to take their seats for the first time on July 18. But without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes, which could lead to several governments replacing each other in quick succession.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's offer to resign was on Monday rejected by Macron, leaving him in place in a caretaker role until the new government is formed.\n\n\"The current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities, then take care of day-to-day business in accordance with republican tradition,\" Macron said, in an attempt to calm the situation two weeks out from the Olympic Games' opening ceremony in Paris. -- CNN", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally",

Furthermore, RN and its allies won 38 seats in the first round after their candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote in their constituencies. Another 485 RN candidates advanced to the second round of voting in the 501 seats that remained where no one candidate won a majority of votes.\n\nRN's success position the party very close to the 289 seats needed for a majority in France's parliament, the National Assembly. (Related: Conservative National Rally slaughters Macron in first round of French election.)\n\nBut Macron shocked the nation by announcing an informal alliance with the NFP to block RN from securing an outright majority in the parliament. Macron urged candidates in his coalition who qualified for the second round of voting but placed third to withdraw from the race to improve the chances of other candidates to defeat RN's own candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, leaders within the NFP - including Jean-Luc Melenchon of the La France Insoumise party, the largest party within the NFP - similarly urged their own candidates who placed third to pull out.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

RN only ended up with 125 seats despite accounting for 32 percent of the vote in the second round of voting. Le Pen's allies in the more mainstream conservative The Republicans under the faction of party president Eric Ciotti won another 17 seats and five percent of the vote, giving RN and its allies a total of 37 percent vote share and 142 seats. This placed them only third in the National Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFP was able to secure 180 seats despite only having 25.8 percent of the vote - approximately three million votes less than what RN and its allies received. Macron's Ensemble coalition followed closely behind with 159 seats and only 24.53 percent of the vote - nearly 3.5 million votes less than what RN and its allies got.\n\nDespite the setback, Le Pen remained optimistic about the current growth of the RN in the National Assembly. \"Two years ago we had just seven MPs. Tonight RN is the first party in France in terms of MP [member of parliament] numbers,\" Le Pen noted.\n\nMoreover, RN is likely to benefit from its current position in the next presidential election in 2027, especially as the country continues to struggle to deal with multiple crises, including a challenging and ballooning national debt. Furthermore, Macron will be ineligible to run in 2027 due to term limits, a situation that will likely weaken the liberal and centrist coalition's influence.\n\nMeanwhile, RN President Jordan Bardella criticized the alliance between Macron and the leftists as an \"alliance of dishonor.\" He also accused Macron of collaborating with the far-left to block RN.\n\nThe latest news about the collapsing

RN then performed strongly in the first round of voting in the French parliamentary elections, before an agreement the leftist bloc and Macron's Together grouping meant that more than 200 candidates dropped out before the second round in an effort to prevent the vote against RN from being split.\n\nThe result was NFP winning around 180 seats in the 577-seat parliment, Macron's group around 160 and Le Pen's party around 140. All three blocs are more than 100 seats short of an absolute majority of 289 seats. With weeks of talks expected over who could become the next prime minister, and what a government will look like. Mr Macron's ally and current prime minister Gabriel Attal offered his resignation following the results but has been asked to stay on by Mr Macron.\n\nFaced with a hung parliament, Mr Macron called for a coalition of all MPs in his pen letter -- with the exception of the populist National Rally and the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party, who are a significant part of the NFP alliance but are seen as almost as extreme as RN by many in the French president's centist group..\n\nHitting back, Sophie Binet, leader of the CGT union, said on Thursday that Mr Macron was in denial about the result of the election and should appoint as prime minister whoever the NFP picks. Members of the alliance have been trying all week to agree on a name and a strategy to govern without a majority.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron must snap out of his denialism. He has lost the election ... He's like Louis XVI holed up at Versailles. He must listen to the country and stop being so disconnected,\" Binet said on LCI television.\n\nMs Binet hinted that protests could continue during the Olympics if Macron did not comply, saying \"at this stage, we haven't planned any strikes during the Olympics, but if Macron continues to throw petrol on to the flames,\" she said, without finishing her sentence. The Olympic Games start on 26 July.\n\nThe French president said in an open letter to the country that nobody had won, despite the left-green alliance coming top but falling far short of an absolute majority.\n\nHe called on all parties \"that identify with republican institutions, rule of law, parliamentarianism, a pro-European stance and French independence to have a sincere, loyal dialogue to build a solid - necessarily plural - majority for the country.\"\n\nThat has been understood to mean he wants a coalition of centrists and moderate parties from the NFP, such as the Socialists and Greens. The letter provoked a furore among other politicians, with centre-left socialist party leader Olivier Faure telling France 2 television that Mr Macron must \"respect\" the choice of French voters. Former deputy of the French National Assembly Gilles Le Gendre said that \"Macronism is over\" and that \"the president has remained deaf.\" Speaking with BFMTV, Mr Le Gendre said: \"The only coalition that exists today is a coalition against the President of the Republic\".\n\nRailway workers' branch of the CGT responded by calling for protests on 18 July -- the day when the newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene. It said the protests should take place in front of prefectures, the seats of state authority all around the country, and in front of the National Assembly in Paris, to demand that the NFP form a government.\n\nThe leader of the radical left LFI Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon also slammed Mr Macron, saying: \"It is the return of the royal veto over universal suffrage! That is enough. He must bow down and call on the NFP. That is simply democracy.\"\n\nManon Aubry, a member of the European Parliament for LFI, denounced a \"total denial of democracy. She continued: \"Today, what he is doing, that is to say refusing the verdict of the ballot boxes, has a name: it is a democratic coup,\" deplores the head of the LFI list for the European elections.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Thanks to deals made last week between Ensemble and the hard-left coalition New Popular Front (NFP) -- led by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's La France Insoumise (LFI) -- to drop their respective candidates out of races they had little chance of winning, NFP took the most seats at 182, followed by Ensemble at 168 and RN with 143.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a clear loss for the RN, though it will make the point that its share of seats in the National Assembly is higher than it has ever been. But given that the RN were in striking distance of an absolute majority, this result must sting.\n\nThis is the first time that a party that received over 30 per cent in the first round has failed to win a second round majority.

Although the party elected a record number of deputies to the National Assembly, its weaknesses were also exposed during the campaign.\n\nThough it won the biggest share of the vote in the first round of the election for seats in the National Assembly, the National Rally (RN) finished in third place after the second round on July 7, overtaken by the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition and the centrist alliance of President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe results of the second round of voting illustrate both the RN's strengths and weaknesses in its bid to win power in France.\n\nIn the new Assembly, the 143 seats won by the RN bloc, including 17 from conservative allies, mark a significant gain from the 89 seats the party won in 2022. The left-wing NFP alliance has 182 seats, ahead of Macron's coalition with 168.\n\nThe RN's electoral advance \"has been contained but not stopped\", says Arnaud Benedetti, editor-in-chief of the Revue politique et parlementaire. \"We can conclude that the National Rally is firmly established in the parliamentary landscape,\" says Benedetti, adding that the party will try to \"strengthen these foundations\" as it prepares for the 2027 presidential election.\n\nThe second round of the vote showed that the RN's elected representatives are gaining a solid foothold with voters.\n\nMost of the party's MPs who were seeking re-election kept their seats. In 2022, 89 constituencies elected an RN candidate to the National Assembly, and 81 voted to re-elect him or her in 2024.\n\nThe spread of far-right ideas\n\nThe far right is increasingly winning the battle of ideas, according to journalist Salom\u00e9 Saqu\u00e9: \"Racist speech has been unleashed. Dozens of physical attacks have been recorded all over France, accompanied by racist insults,\" she posted on social media.\n\nDuring the campaign, she said, the RN managed to shift the debate in the direction of its primary themes, of \"insecurity, immigration\" - and to impose \"its vocabulary\".\n\nFor Benedetti, the result of these legislative elections represents a \"failure\" for the far right given the forecasts of a large RN victory.\n\nLeading in 258 out of 577 constituencies after the first round, the RN sank to third place in the second round, behind the NFP and the centrist presidential camp.\n\nThe RN had to contend with the so-called \"Republican front\" in the second round, where parties of the left and centre decide to co-operate to defeat the far right. More than 200 candidates across France pulled out of the second round so that a better-placed rival could prevent the RN from winning.\n\nThe Republican Front strategy \"worked better than anyone imagined\", says Benedetti.\n\nNational Rally president Jordan Bardella described the move by left and centrist parties to combine forces to block the RN as an \"alliance of dishonour\". \"These agreements throw France into the arms of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's far left,\" he added during a speech at RN headquarters.\n\nBardella's rhetoric is seen by critics as playing on the longstanding feelings of resentment RN voters have towards traditional parties that band together to oppose their party.\n\nThe RN \"will certainly capitalise on what will be perceived by part of their electorate as what they call 'theft'\", says Benedetti.\n\nWhile the strategy of blocking the RN may have worked again, every issue that \"is at the core of the National Rally vote remains\", says Benedetti. \"The question of purchasing power, law and order, neglect of rural districts and regions ... All these issues are not going to miraculously disappear before 2027.\"\n\nRead moreScenarios for governing after French vote produces hung parliament\n\nLack of professionalism and racist remarks\n\nBenedetti says the RN's defeat also has other causes: \"The lack of professionalism of their candidates during the campaign worked against them and may have dissuaded voters from voting for them\".\n\nFrance Culture journalist Nora Hamadi says there were also \"mistakes made by RN staffers\", who were unable to prevent a number of candidates from making speeches \"which brought out the racist and xenophobic\" aspects of the party.\n\nIn addition, Bardella, the party's candidate to head the government, could have been seen by some supporters \"as insufficiently prepared for the role of prime minister\", says Benedetti.\n\nThe controversy over the status of French people who have dual nationality may also have slowed the RN's progress, he says.\n\nRN deputy Roger Chudeau, who has been re-elected, said during the campaign that the appointment of the former Socialist Education Minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a \"Franco-Moroccan\", had been a \"mistake\", referring more broadly to a risk of \"dual loyalty\" on the part of dual nationals.\n\nLe Pen distanced herself from her Chudeau's \"personal positions\" which she judged to be \"contrary\" to the party line.\n\nFaced with contentious comments by what Bardella called \"black sheep\" candidates, the RN blamed a very tight timeframe in which to vet candidates due to Macron's surprise dissolution of the Assembly.\n\nBefore the second-round vote Bardella said that candidates who made racist, xenophobic or conspiracy-mongering statements during the legislative campaign had no place in the RN.\n\n\"All those who make comments that are not in line with my convictions will be thrown out,\" he said.\n\nThe larger question is whether the RN can rid itself of its \"black sheep\", leverage its voting bloc in the Assembly to become more of a party of government and succeed in improving its image for the next election.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors":

RN then performed strongly in the first round of voting in the French parliamentary elections, before an agreement the leftist bloc and Macron's Together grouping meant that more than 200 candidates dropped out before the second round in an effort to prevent the vote against RN from being split.\n\nThe result was NFP winning around 180 seats in the 577-seat parliment, Macron's group around 160 and Le Pen's party around 140. All three blocs are more than 100 seats short of an absolute majority of 289 seats. With weeks of talks expected over who could become the next prime minister, and what a government will look like. Mr Macron's ally and current prime minister Gabriel Attal offered his resignation following the results but has been asked to stay on by Mr Macron.\n\nFaced with a hung parliament, Mr Macron called for a coalition of all MPs in his pen letter -- with the exception of the populist National Rally and the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party, who are a significant part of the NFP alliance but are seen as almost as extreme as RN by many in the French president's centist group..\n\nHitting back, Sophie Binet, leader of the CGT union, said on Thursday that Mr Macron was in denial about the result of the election and should appoint as prime minister whoever the NFP picks. Members of the alliance have been trying all week to agree on a name and a strategy to govern without a majority.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron must snap out of his denialism. He has lost the election ... He's like Louis XVI holed up at Versailles. He must listen to the country and stop being so disconnected,\" Binet said on LCI television.\n\nMs Binet hinted that protests could continue during the Olympics if Macron did not comply, saying \"at this stage, we haven't planned any strikes during the Olympics, but if Macron continues to throw petrol on to the flames,\" she said, without finishing her sentence. The Olympic Games start on 26 July.\n\nThe French president said in an open letter to the country that nobody had won, despite the left-green alliance coming top but falling far short of an absolute majority.\n\nHe called on all parties \"that identify with republican institutions, rule of law, parliamentarianism, a pro-European stance and French independence to have a sincere, loyal dialogue to build a solid - necessarily plural - majority for the country.\"\n\nThat has been understood to mean he wants a coalition of centrists and moderate parties from the NFP, such as the Socialists and Greens. The letter provoked a furore among other politicians, with centre-left socialist party leader Olivier Faure telling France 2 television that Mr Macron must \"respect\" the choice of French voters. Former deputy of the French National Assembly Gilles Le Gendre said that \"Macronism is over\" and that \"the president has remained deaf.\" Speaking with BFMTV, Mr Le Gendre said: \"The only coalition that exists today is a coalition against the President of the Republic\".\n\nRailway workers' branch of the CGT responded by calling for protests on 18 July -- the day when the newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene. It said the protests should take place in front of prefectures, the seats of state authority all around the country, and in front of the National Assembly in Paris, to demand that the NFP form a government.\n\nThe leader of the radical left LFI Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon also slammed Mr Macron, saying: \"It is the return of the royal veto over universal suffrage! That is enough. He must bow down and call on the NFP. That is simply democracy.\"\n\nManon Aubry, a member of the European Parliament for LFI, denounced a \"total denial of democracy. She continued: \"Today, what he is doing, that is to say refusing the verdict of the ballot boxes, has a name: it is a democratic coup,\" deplores the head of the LFI list for the European elections.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org",

"France's President Emmanuel Macron uses a cellphone as he attends a meeting at Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, US, on Wednesday. -- Reuters\n\nFrench left-wingers attacked President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday after he called for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall

demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall majority, the result left France rudderless at home, where it will host the Olympic

weighing the prospect of French instability on top of the potential return of NATO-sceptic Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nMacron did not speak to the press at the event.\n\nMarkets are also anxious, with warnings this week from ratings agencies that uncertainty over government finances could lead to credit downgrades for its over three-trillion-euro ($3.25 trillion) debt pile.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned against the left's economic programme without naming the NFP specifically.\n\n\"In the economic competition, our small firms, our companies can't be weighed down with excessive wage costs, including the minimum wage, and by taxes that are too heavy,\" Villeroy told broadcaster Franceinfo.\n\nThe NFP vowed ahead of the polls both to increase the minimum wage and to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy.\n\nRevenue would pay for welfare projects including reversing Macron's widely resented increase to the official retirement age.\n\n\"We spend a lot more than we pay in taxes, including on social spending and pensions,\" Villeroy said.\n\n\"That's what creates the budget deficit,\" he added, after the government overspent by 5.5 percent of GDP last year, well above the EU limit of three percent.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The left-wing NFP alliance, which won the most seats, has called for the will of the voters to be respected.\n\nThe vote, which Macron unexpectedly called after losing to the far-right National Rally (RN) in European elections, has plunged France into uncharted waters, with three politically divergent blocs and no obvious path to forming a government.\n\nIn a letter to regional newspapers published Wednesday, the deeply unpopular Macron urged mainstream parties with \"republican values\" to form a governing coalition and said he hoped to pick a prime minister from such a grouping.\n\n\"Let us place our hope in the ability of our political leaders to demonstrate sense, harmony and calm in your interest, and that of the country,\" he wrote. \"It is in the light of these principles that I will decide on the appointment of the prime minister.\"\n\nLeft denounces 'machinations'\n\nThe New Popular Front (NFP), a hastily assembled alliance of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party and the Socialist, Green and Communist parties, unexpectedly won the most seats in Sunday's vote, but not a majority.\n\nMacron's centrist camp came second and the RN third after 215 third-placed candidates from the left and centre withdrew from the run-off to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote, scuppering the far right's hopes of winning a majority and forming a government.\n\nIt would be customary for Macron to call on the biggest parliamentary group, in this case the left-wing bloc, to form a government, but the constitution does not oblige him to do so.\n\nMacron did not explicitly call for the RN or France Unbowed to be excluded from a governing coalition, but his mention of \"republican values\" is typically understood to exclude parties on the far left or the far right.\n\nSeveral France Unbowed lawmakers reacted to Macron's letter by saying that he should accept the left-wing alliance's pick for prime minister, when it has agreed on one, and allow the bloc to form a government.\n\n\"The best he can do for the country at this stage is to allow the group that won the most seats, the New Popular Front, to govern. Any other machinations would be truly problematic and dangerous for democracy,\" said one of them, Eric Coquerel, on LCI television.\n\nCentre-left Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure told France 2 television that Macron must \"respect\" the choice of French voters and nominate a prime minister from the NFP.\n\nPolitical paralysis\n\nFinancial markets, the European Commission and France's euro zone partners are all watching closely to see whether the impasse can be broken.\n\nOptions include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBut any government - of the left, centre, or a broader coalition - could quickly be toppled by a vote of no confidence from the opposition if it had not secured sufficient support.\n\nRN leader Jordan Bardella said Macron was to blame for the political paralysis.\n\n\"And now his message is: 'sort something out'. Irresponsible!\" he posted on X, referring to Macron's letter.\n\nTone hardens\n\nBardella's mentor, the long-time RN leader Marine Le Pen, has spent the last few years cleaning up the image of a party once known for racism and antisemitism, and must now decide what strategy to adopt to win the 2027 presidential election.\n\nShe has framed the tactical withdrawals as an establishment plot to keep her party from power.\n\nOn Wednesday her tone hardened, when she drew parallels between a hard-left politician's call for a march towards the prime minister's office and the assault on Capitol Hill by supporters of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nShe said the NFP has almost \"subversive attitudes since they are calling for Matignon to be taken by force,\" referring to the prime minister's office. \"It's their assault on the Capitol.\"\n\nShe was reacting to a social media post by France Unbowed lawmaker Adrien Quatennens, who accused Macron of wanting to \"steal\" the left's victory after he asked centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to stay on for now, for stability. Quatennens had called for \"a big popular march\" on Matignon.\n\nResponding to Le Pen, Quatennens said she was \"nuts\" to liken his suggestion to a call for insurrection.", "source": {"uri":

Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats.\n\nIt is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest parliamentary group - in this case the NFP - and ask it to form a government.\n\nBut Macron and his Ensemble allies have repeatedly refused to enter into coalition with the far-left France Unbowed, the largest single party within the NFP, and have accused its leader, the 72-year-old firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of being just as extreme and unfit to govern as figures on the far right.\n\nThe NFP formed days after Macron called the snap vote, and chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. After tactical voting and political bargaining between centrist and left-wing voters, the NFP managed the same feat in Sunday's second round.\n\nBut the NFP does not speak with a single voice. The various parties in the coalition straddle vast ideological ground, from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Place Publique and Socialist parties. When the shock result was announced, each party celebrated separately, and the bloc still has not nominated a leader to become prime minister.\n\nM\u00e9lenchon has stated his intention to govern France. In a victory speech Sunday evening near Stalingrad Square in Paris, he said Macron \"has the duty\" to ask the NFP to form a government.\n\nUnlike its neighbors Italy and Germany, France - with its presidential system - lacks the culture of coalition-building and compromise, meaning the formation of a new government could take weeks and prove fleeting.\n\nNewly-elected members of parliament, called \"deputies,\" are scheduled to take their seats for the first time on July 18. But without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes, which could lead to several governments replacing each other in quick succession.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's offer to resign was on Monday rejected by Macron, leaving him in place in a caretaker role until the new government is formed.\n\n\"The current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities, then take care of day-to-day business in accordance with republican tradition,\" Macron said, in an attempt to calm the situation two weeks out from the Olympic Games' opening ceremony in Paris.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He certainly did not get what he was hoping for. His 'Ensemble' coalition came second and lost 72 seats. His two political opponents - the New Popular Front (NFP, a left-wing coalition) and National Rally (RN, far right) fared well in many respects.\n\nThis was a strange election. The campaign was brisk and tense, and the first-round results set National Rally as the clear favourite to win the second round. Until the end, all opinion polls predicted a clear RN win, which, however, did not materialise on election night. The reason for this unexpected outcome is that the French electorate voted tactically and did so to avoid letting RN win the race. Had RN prevailed in the ballot box, Macron would have had to invite Jordan Bardella, the RN leader, to form a far-right government, a first in France since World War II.\n\nTactical voting is called the 'republican front' in France. It refers to the array of political parties in the mainstream that share common political values as opposed to fringe parties on the extremes. This voting reflex shows that a large majority of voters still regard RN as a party that represents a 'threat to democracy'. Despite Marine Le Pen's hard work to 'de-demonise' her party, voters still do not think RN is a mainstream party. In between the two rounds, the French press reminded voters of that reality by running stories about RN candidates with extremist backgrounds or a record of racist and antisemitic statements. The 'republican front' worked far better than expected and was key to the election outcome. Twice, Emmanuel Macron was elected to the presidency thanks to left-wing votes that helped him defeat Marine Le Pen in 2017 and 2022. Macron was ungracious enough to fail to acknowledge this support. Besides, in the run-up to the vote, he dismissed both opposing blocs as 'extremes'. Yet, left-wing voters were very disciplined and voted in droves for 'Ensemble' candidates whenever their favourite candidate had pulled out from the race to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote. This explains why Macron's coalition, with only 12 seats less than NFP, eventually did better than expected.\n\nAfter the first round, a Bardella government seemed on the cards. In the end, the far right came in third position. It is a setback, but whether RN leaders will feel aggrieved at the result remains to be seen. By declaring that 'our victory is only postponed', with the 2027 presidential election in mind, Marine Le Pen may have a point. Despite being defeated, RN can point to new successes. With 143 MPs, RN has won 55 more seats, the biggest gains of all parties. It is now a competitive party in virtually all constituencies across France and appeals to all segments of the electorate in terms of class, gender and age. As for seats and vote percentage, RN is now, by far, the first party in French politics. The truth is that Macron's dissolution took the far-right party by surprise: Jordan Bardella, the untested 28-year-old leader, was not ready to govern. Le Pen may also have secretly breathed a sigh of relief: running a minority government for three years may have been an unwelcome distraction from her fourth presidential bid. So, a defeat it may be this time round for RN, but certainly not a disaster. In the meantime, RN will bid its time in opposition and call out the 'establishment parties' of the left and right, which have jointly 'stolen' RN's victory.\n\nFor the left, it was the sweetest of victory. Deeply divided until just a month ago, it managed a most unlikely come-back to win the election. NFP drafted a common programme in no time and ran a disciplined campaign. This paid off for several reasons. First, NFP's programme advocates solid wealth redistribution through imposing a wealth tax on financial transactions, it is committed to raising the minimum wage, reversing Macron's rise in the pension age from 62 to 64 or investing in public services. These areas have been neglected by Macron, so NFP's left-wing Social Democracy struck a chord with the electorate. Furthermore, NFP is a broad left-wing coalition, not a 'hard left' one. It comprises radical left forces (such as Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's France Insoumise) but also moderate ones (such as former president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's Parti Socialiste who, in another twist in the tale, was elected an MP in his old Corr\u00e8ze constituency). During the campaign, the divisive and controversial M\u00e9lenchon was decisively sidelined by his coalition partners. Socialists, Greens and Communists all came out publicly against his appointment as prime minister, should the left win the election. Now that it has won, Macron should invite NPF to form a government. A left-wing prime minister should be a consensual figure who can unite the left, work with Macron and make necessary compromises with his/her political opponents. A younger and female prime minister would be a good move for the left. Marine Tondelier, the Green party leader, who ran an energetic and impressive campaign, would fit such a description.\n\nPresident Macron did not accept Gabriel Attal's resignation as incumbent prime minister. He knows that forming a government may take time, as several options may be tested: a minority left-wing government, then a national unity coalition government comprising left-wing moderates, Ensemble ministers and some Republicans. Macron's dissolution has not clarified anything. The vote made him much weaker altogether, and there is no absolute majority in sight in the National Assembly. What is more, Macron has not weakened the far right. On the contrary, RN is even more of a threat than it was before the election. All in all, this snap election has provided anything but clarification. France is still in a severe political conundrum with months, possibly years, of political instability and crisis. If indeed France experiences a major political crisis, Marine Le Pen's RN might present itself as the alternative to a 'failed and corrupt political establishment' offering political stability and order.", "source": {"uri": "feps-europe.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "feps-europe.eu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score":

In a letter to regional newspapers on Wednesday, Macron stated that \"no one won\" the parliamentary election and called on parties that uphold \"republican values\" to come together to form a governing alliance.\n\n\"Let us place our hopes in the ability of our political leaders to demonstrate a sense of harmony and conciliation in your interest, and in the interest of the country,\" he wrote, according to a CNBC translation. \"It is in light of these principles that I will decide on the appointment of the prime minister.\"\n\nMeanwhile, French left-wingers on Thursday criticised Macron following his call for a broad coalition government, insisting that their movement should be the one to propose a prime minister.\n\nMacron Faces Backlash From Left Bloc\n\nMembers of the New Popular Front (NFP) have strongly criticised President Emmanuel Macron's appeal for mainstream parties to create a new coalition, which might exclude more extreme factions. Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure condemned Macron for not \"respecting the vote of the French people,\" while LFI leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon denounced the move as a \"return of the royal veto.\" Sophie Binet, head of France's largest trade union federation, the CGT, also used imagery from France's former monarchy to criticize the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she remarked, referring to the king who was executed during the French Revolution in 1793. She continued, \"If Macron does not respect the election results, he could risk throwing the country into chaos once more.\"\n\nThe president's letter seemed to exclude both LFI, the largest faction in the New Popular Front (NFP) left alliance, and the far-right National Rally (RN) from participating in the new coalition.\n\nFrance Election Results 2024\n\nIn the second round of voting last Sunday, France's left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), secured the most seats, surpassing the far-right National Rally, which had led in the first round. Despite winning 180 seats, the NFP did not reach the 289-seat majority needed in the 577-seat National Assembly.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Bloc_(Portugal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left Bloc (Portugal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_France_Insoumise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La France Insoumise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Faure", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivier Faure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_M\u00e9lenchon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Party (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Binet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophie Binet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis XVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Confederation of Labour (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/07/11/article/image/Harish Rawat (1)-1720701841224.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722719", "eventUri": "eng-9722719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Macron's centrist 'Together' bloc came second in the ballot with 163 seats, and RN and its allies won 143 seats.\n\nFrance's hung-parliament scenario is not familiar territory, and parties on the left, center and right are now jockeying to form alliances and a viable coalition government.\n\nThat's not an easy task when the political blocs that fought the snap election are made up of a range of parties with a variety of ideological positions -- for instance, the NFP includes the more radical anti-capitalist France Unbowed and French Communist Party to the more moderate and center-left Socialist Party and the Greens.\n\nJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon -- the leader of the largest party in the NFP, the far-left France Unbowed -- earlier this week called on Macron to allow the bloc to form a government, and said that the French president should accept their pick for prime minister. The NFP have not yet agreed on a potential candidate for the post.\n\nFrench presidents traditionally select a prime minister from the party that wins the most votes in parliamentary election, but they are not obliged to do so. They can reject the nomination of a party, if it's not seen to have enough seats to form a stable government.\n\nIn his letter, Macron signalled a wish for parties with \"republican values\" -- code for more centrist parties, rather than far-left or far-right factions -- to lead a government.\n\nAnalysts say a minority center-right government is the new base-case scenario for France, following Macron's smoke signals.\n\n\"The most likely solution -- but perhaps short-lived -- now appears to be a minority coalition between Macron's much-reduced center and the ex-Gaullist center-right,\" Eurasia Group's Mujtaba Rahman and Anna-Carina Hamker, said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThey gave a 55% probability of success to such a centrist minority coalition -- made up of Macron's Ensemble ('Together') bloc and the center-right Les Republicains (LR, with 66 seats) plus up to six centrist independents.\n\nTallying around 235 seats between its constituents, such a potential minority alliance would, the analysts noted, come \"far short of a majority but not far short of the 250 seats with which Macron governments survived uneasily for two years after the 2022 presidential and parliamentary elections.\"\n\n\"It is evident that Macron has no intention of appointing a minority government of the left. His intention seems to be to play for time and hope that French politicians will be obliged eventually to 'go Belgian or Dutch' and accept that splintered parliaments demand compromises and coalitions,\" Rahman and Hamker added.\n\nAntonio Barroso, deputy director of research at consultancy Teneo, said that the prospect of a centrist-led minority government was not a \"very realistic\" possibility at this stage.\n\n\"Together is extremely divided, and the MPs [lawmakers] from the more progressive wing of the alliance are opposed to forming a government with LR. Moreover, many LR MPs are reluctant to cut a deal with Together,\" he said in a note Wednesday.\n\nHe added that a Together-LR coalition government could also be easily dismissed by a no-confidence motion supported by France Unbowed and National Rally.\n\nAs the chance of getting one of the left's candidates into the prime minister's office appeared to recede on Wednesday, Macron's opponents were scathing about the president's comments.\n\nFrance Unbowed's M\u00e9lenchon described the letter as akin to a \"presidential coup,\" stating on X that \"the people's vote must be respected.\"\n\nNational Rally's 28 year-old leader Jordan Bardella meanwhile criticized Macron for creating the political mess that France now finds itself in.\n\nBlaming Macron for the political \"paralysis\" France is experiencing, Bardella commented in a CNBC-translated X update that the French president's \"message is as of now: 'sort something out'.

His intention seems to be to play for time and hope that French politicians will be obliged eventually to 'go Belgian or Dutch' and accept that splintered parliaments demand compromises and coalitions,\" Rahman and Hamker added.\n\nAntonio Barroso, deputy director of research at consultancy Teneo, said that the prospect of a centrist-led minority government was not a \"very realistic\" possibility at this stage.\n\n\"Together is extremely divided, and the MPs [lawmakers] from the more progressive wing of the alliance are opposed to forming a government with LR.

President Emmanuel Macron may have seen the far-right National Rally party, or RN, relegated to third place in the country's national assembly election on Sunday, but he still faces a major headache over the makeup of the country's next government.\n\nMacron's centrist coalition Ensemble finished second behind the hastily concocted New Popular Front alliance of parties of the left, or NFP, with RN in third.\n\nNone of them won the 289 seats needed for an outright majority, so now a round of horse-trading is taking place as people look to build alliances.\n\nMacron is safe in his role as president, but faces having to contend with a new parliament no more sympathetic to him than the one before he called the snap election.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal has offered his resignation, but Macron has asked him to remain in office until the post-election fog clears.\n\nThat does not seem like it will happen in a hurry, and to exacerbate the situation, this week Macron has to go to Washington for a meeting of leaders of the NATO military alliance.\n\n'Choice of voters'\n\nMathilde Panot, parliamentary leader of one of the NFP parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, said Macron should \"bow to the choice of the ballot box\" and let the NFP take over.\n\nThis would lead to a situation known as cohabitation, where the president would be from a different party to the prime minister and the cabinet.\n\nThis has been done before, but only when there has been a party with a clear majority, which is not the case now.\n\nClement Beaune, the former transport minister and a close ally of Macron, who lost his seat in the election, said the NFP had no entitlement to power.\n\nWriting on social media platform X, he conceded that the election had given the NFP \"rights\", but said the lack of a majority showed many of its members were not elected in their own right, but as a rejection of RN.\n\n\"The only answer is a broad coalition which party leaders must start negotiating,\" he wrote.\n\nMacron has indicated his openness to forming a so-called rainbow coalition, which could include dissident members of the right-wing Republican party, who declined to join a preelection pact that party leader Eric Ciotti struck with RN.\n\nBut in a sign of how widespread divisions are across the political spectrum, Johanna Rolland, the chief negotiator for the Socialist party, has indicated it might welcome Ensemble members into the fold.\n\n\"We are clear-sighted but not sectarian, so those who want to meet us on these bases -- I'm thinking, notably, about left-wing

In a letter to regional newspapers, Macron urged mainstream parties with \"republican values\" to form a governing coalition and said he hoped to pick a prime minister from such a grouping.\n\n\"Let us place our hope in the ability of our political leaders to demonstrate sense, harmony and calm in your interest, and that of the country,\" he wrote. \"It is in the light of these principles that I will decide on the appointment of the prime minister.\"\n\nThree major political blocs emerged from the elections -- yet none of them is close to the majority of at least 289 seats out of 577 in the National Assembly. While not uncommon in other European countries, modern France has never experienced a parliament with no dominant party. The left-wing bloc secured the most number seats while Macron's centrist alliance came second, and the Marine Le Pen-led RN, which appeared to inch closer to a majority, came in third due to political manoeuvring to stop them from power.\n\nThe left bloc New Popular Front (NFP), which won the most number of seats, comprises the hard-left France Unbowed party and the Socialist, Green and Communist parties. Macron has previously said he would not work with the hard-left France Unbowed party, but he could possibly stretch out a hand to the Socialists and the Greens.\n\nIt would be customary for Macron to call on the biggest parliamentary group, in this case, the left-wing bloc, to form a government, but nothing in the constitution obliges him to do so. Macron did not explicitly call for the RN or France Unbowed to be excluded from a governing coalition, but his mention of \"republican values\" is typically understood to exclude parties on the far left or the far right.\n\nMeanwhile, several France Unbowed lawmakers reacted to Macron's letter by saying that he should accept the left-wing alliance's pick for prime minister, when it has agreed on one, and allow the bloc to form a government. \"The best he can do for the country at this stage is to allow the group that won the most seats, the New Popular Front, to govern. Any other machinations would be truly problematic and dangerous for democracy,\" said Eric Coquerel.\n\nOptions include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis, with ad hoc agreements. France's fractious politics and deep divisions over taxes, immigration and Mideast policy would make kit harder to implement Macron's policies after the unprecedented election results.\n\nRN leader Jordan Bardella said Macron was to blame for the political paralysis. \"And now his message is: 'sort something out'. Irresponsible!\" he posted on X, referring to Macron's letter. His mentor, the long-time RN leader Marine Le Pen, has spent the last few years cleaning up the image of a party once known for racism and antisemitism and is now looking at prospects to win the 2027 presidential election.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal submitted his resignation after the election results. However, Macron decided to keep his Attal in office after parliamentary elections in which the government's political camp lost its role as the strongest party to the left in a hung parliament to ensure stability. France Unbowed lawmaker Adrien Quatennens accused Macron of wanting to \"steal\" the left's victory after this decision.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_France_Insoumise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La France Insoumise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant-party_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominant-party system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_French_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017 French presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Quatennens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrien Quatennens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/macron-1720672175.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722719", "eventUri": "eng-9722719", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

locking himself away in Versailles': France left wing blasts Macron, demands PM power | News24", "body": "President Emmanuel Macron called for a broad coalition government.\n\nFrench left-wingers attacked President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday after he called for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall majority, the result left France rudderless at home, where it will host the Olympic Games in just over two weeks, and weakened abroad, where President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington for a NATO summit focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an open letter to voters, Macron said Wednesday that \"nobody won\" the ballot.\n\nHe has left centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition.\n\nREAD | Leftist alliance leads French election, no absolute majority, initial estimates show\n\nSocialist Party chief Olivier Faure accused Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people\", while LFI figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon blasted the \"return of the royal veto\".\n\nSophie Binet, head of France's biggest trade union federation, the CGT, also enlisted the image of France's long-defunct monarchy to attack the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she said, referring to the king guillotined in 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\nThe president's letter appeared to rule out a role for either LFI - the largest player in the New Popular Front (NFP) left alliance - or the far-right National Rally (RN) in the new coalition.\n\nVoters from different camps joined forces in the second-round run-off to shut the RN out of power in a \"republican front\", allowing Macron's followers to claim second place with 164 seats and leaving the far right in third at 143.\n\nWith each of the three blocs controlling roughly one-third of the chamber, it may be a long slog to find a government able to survive a no-confidence vote.\n\n\"We can't form a national unity government with just one camp,\" Macron ally Francois Bayrou told AFP, calling for a prime minister able to \"bring people together\".\n\nThe conservative Republicans party - once the vehicle of presidents like Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, but now reduced to 40 seats - has refused to join a government coalition, but says it could vote to adopt a legislative programme.\n\nThree-time RN presidential candidate Marine Le Pen meanwhile dismissed Macron's letter as a \"disgraceful circus\".\n\nHer party now has its eyes firmly on France's next presidential election in 2027, when term limits mean Macron will not be able to stand again.\n\nMacron arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a NATO summit where allies may now be weighing the prospect of French instability on top of the potential return of NATO-sceptic Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nMacron did not speak to the press at the event.\n\nMarkets are also anxious, with warnings this week from ratings agencies that uncertainty over government finances could lead to credit downgrades for its over \u20ac3 trillion ($3.25 trillion) debt pile.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned against the left's economic programme without naming the NFP specifically.\n\n\"In the economic competition, our small firms, our companies can't be weighed down with excessive wage costs, including the minimum wage, and by taxes that are too heavy,\" Villeroy told broadcaster Franceinfo.\n\nThe NFP vowed ahead of the polls both to increase the minimum wage and to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy.\n\nRevenue would pay for welfare projects including reversing Macron's widely resented increase to the official retirement age.\n\n\"We spend a lot more than we pay in taxes, including on social spending and pensions,\" Villeroy said.\n\n\"That's what creates the budget deficit,\" he added, after the government overspent by 5.5% of GDP in 2023, well above the EU limit of 3%.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"},

Looked at one way, that might seem like bad news for Marine Le Pen's party. On 7 July, forced to fight parliamentary elections against an informal but remarkably united front ranging from the hard left to Emmanuel Macron's centrists, RN fell short of the victory it had won in the first round of voting a week earlier. But viewed from another angle, in this increasingly binary confrontation, everything depends on the strength of the \"republican front\" opposing Le Pen, and the outcome of the election leaves many doubts on this point.\n\nIt was one thing for RN to face a moderate and effective mainstream bloc led by leaders such as Jacques Chirac or Macron. That bloc belongs to the past. Macron may have hoped to reconstruct it after his surprising decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June. For that he would have to peel off the socialist and green elements of the left-wing alliance, New Popular Front (NFP), the winners on 7 July. He miscalculated, as it seems the NFP will hold together, at least for now.\n\nInstead, France will enter a period of political deadlock and chaos. It is possible that financial markets will be unnerved by the promise of spending increases if, as is natural to expect, the NFP ends up having a significant influence over policy decisions under a new government. But the path towards political balance is extremely uncertain. No political bloc has anything approaching a parliamentary majority. A caretaker government may have to be appointed while successive negotiations begin and end.\n\nLe Pen and her young sidekick, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, were quick to deny they were disappointed with the results. There was an element of pretence, of course, but ultimately they can find comfort in the fact that RN and its allies were able to get around 37 per cent of the vote in the election's second round, up from 17 per cent in elections two years ago. If we add the seats already decided in the first round, where RN ended on top, that figure will be even higher. RN and its allies received around ten million votes on 7 July, significantly higher than the NFP's seven million. These are promising results for the presidential duel in 2027. Will the republican front still hold three years from now?\n\nLe Pen has always scored considerably better than her party. Moreover, in 2027 she may face an increasingly fragmented coalition of groupings and factions, whose centre of gravity has shifted to the left and which lacks a clear leader of Macron's stature and charisma. History buffs will recognise the pattern where a hard-right party is able to acquire power only after the hard left spends time governing. RN will benefit from being able to tell the French public the choice is now between Le Pen and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the leader of France Unbowed, the leftist party with the greatest weight inside the NFP. Did the centre hold? It did, but only by metamorphosing into something that no longer deserves to be called the centre. The centre is Macron, but Macron is now a mere concept; he is the definition of a lame duck.\n\nWhen the president made the strange decision to call the elections, one of the possible explanations was that he intended to offer the reins of the executive to Bardella so that RN could finally experience the corrosive effect of governing France. If that was the goal, it backfired. Bardella will not be in charge of the new government and RN can now sit back and enjoy what will certainly be a new level of ungovernability.\n\nOne fact that became very clear to me as I watched the TV debates between Bardella and Gabriel Attal, the prime minister from Macron's Renaissance party, was the close link between France's diminished global role and influence and RN's ascent. RN thrives on French weakness. This is what distinguishes the current populism from far-right movements a century ago.\n\nHistorically, European fascism was born of an inebriation with power: colonial power over the world, technological power over nature and, ultimately, human power over history. Le Pen's populism is the exact opposite: it calls for a return of the state because France needs a strong hand to survive in a cut-throat global environment. The new European populism is very close to the kind of third-world nationalism that ruled the peripheries of the global system throughout the 20th century. Which makes sense if we think that Europe is moving to a periphery of its own.\n\nIn the TV debates, Bardella leaned on three main points. First, what he calls economic patriotism: he wants France to use the tools of state power to compete in a global economy where other countries and other continents now threaten its continued prosperity. Second, migration. Here, too, the problem is that French and European populations are no longer in charge: migrants arrive on their shores unwilling to be integrated as they no longer feel they are in a position of complete subordination. It is not immigration but immigration \"not on our terms\" that so infuriates RN voters.\n\nThe third theme is the climate crisis. This is also presented as an index of declining power by RN. In fact, Bardella and other national conservatives in Europe and the US seem to see it as an intellectual defeat: the West's inability even to understand its own interests. For Bardella, the call for an energy transition is a trick being played on Europe by the developing world, who wish to see Europeans unilaterally abandon fossil fuels in order to turn the global economic game in their favour.\n\nIt is not clear these forces can be stopped. Macron did, to some extent, manage to understand them, but he failed, perhaps through no fault of his own, to fashion a France so buoyant and prosperous that the very notion of decline would vanish. Instead, the sense of decline may now intensify. Political chaos, confusion and incompetence are almost inevitable. This will sit poorly with the French attachment to national grandeur.\n\nIn this context, France Unbowed may help RN to make its case because it harbours a powerful delusion that France and its economy are strong enough to weather an encounter with global markets and capital. This view will clash with reality. The result, revealing the limits of French power, will swell RN's ranks. Does this mean every progressive option is now closed in France? No, but it's increasingly clear that only those countries that are winning the global competition have the kind of freedom of action that permits progressive options. (Singapore's housing policy and the Swiss pension reform are often given as examples of this freedom.)\n\nReacting to the results on 7 July, Bardella sounded much more emotional than Le Pen, calling the tactical exit of hundreds of candidates from the second round a system of \"unnatural\" alliances between the left and Macron. How can something that actually happened be unnatural? Yet Bardella may have a point as a recurrence of the same united front against RN will be far more difficult in the future. It may have become unnatural.\n\nIf the leftists of the NFP are granted the power to form a government, they - rather than RN - might get burned by the clash between promise and reality. If Macron denies them the keys to the Matignon, the residence of the prime minister, the left will feel justifiably betrayed. They defeated RN, a joyous moment celebrated by the left and centrists all over the world. Can Emmanuel Macron keep them at bay? Should he? In the end, it might be true: the centre cannot hold.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruno_macaes@newstatesman.com",

blasts Macron, demands keys to govt", "body": "France's economy faces an uncertain future after the inconclusive vote\n\nFrench left-wingers attacked President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday after he called for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall majority, the result left France rudderless at home, where it will host the Olympic Games in just over two weeks, and weakened abroad, where President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington for a NATO summit focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an open letter to voters, Macron said Wednesday that \"nobody won\" the ballot.\n\nHe has left centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition.\n\nSocialist Party chief Olivier Faure accused Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people\", while LFI figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon blasted the \"return of the royal veto\".\n\nSophie Binet, head of France's biggest trade union federation, the CGT, also enlisted the image of France's long-defunct monarchy to attack the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she said, referring to the king guillotined in 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\n\"If (Macron) doesn't respect the result of the polls, he risks plunging the country into chaos once again,\" she said.\n\n- 'Bring people together' -\n\nThe president's letter appeared to rule out a role for either LFI -- the largest player in the New Popular Front (NFP) left alliance -- or the far-right National Rally (RN) in the new coalition.\n\nVoters from different camps joined forces in the second-round run-off to shut the RN out of power in a \"republican front\", allowing Macron's followers to claim second place with 164 seats and leaving the far right in third at 143.\n\nWith each of the three blocs controlling roughly one-third of the chamber, it may be a long slog to find a government able to survive a no-confidence vote.\n\n\"We can't form a national unity government with just one camp,\" Macron ally Francois Bayrou told AFP, calling for a prime minister able to \"bring people together\".\n\nThe conservative Republicans party -- once the vehicle of presidents like Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, but now reduced to 40 seats -- has refused to join a government coalition, but says it could vote to adopt a legislative programme.\n\nThree-time RN presidential candidate Marine Le Pen meanwhile dismissed Macron's letter as a \"disgraceful circus\".\n\nHer party now has its eyes firmly on France's next presidential election in 2027, when term limits mean Macron will not be able to stand again.\n\n- Economic fears -\n\nMacron arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a NATO summit where allies may now be weighing the prospect of French instability on top of the potential return of NATO-sceptic Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nMacron did not speak to the press at the event.\n\nMarkets are also anxious, with warnings this week from ratings agencies that uncertainty over government finances could lead to credit downgrades for its over three-trillion-euro ($3.25 trillion) debt pile.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned against the left's economic programme without naming the NFP specifically.\n\n\"In the economic competition, our small firms, our companies can't be weighed down with excessive wage costs, including the minimum wage, and by taxes that are too heavy,\" Villeroy told broadcaster Franceinfo.\n\nThe NFP vowed ahead of the polls both to increase the minimum wage and to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy.\n\nRevenue would pay for welfare projects including reversing Macron's widely resented increase to the official retirement age.\n\n\"We spend a lot more than we pay in taxes, including on social spending and pensions,\" Villeroy said.\n\n\"That's what creates the budget deficit,\" he added, after the government overspent by 5.5 percent of GDP last year, well above the EU limit of three percent.\n\nburs-tgb/dc/js\n\nMore from

Members of the alliance have been trying all week to agree on a name and a strategy to govern without a majority.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron must snap out of his denialism. He has lost the election ... He's like Louis XVI holed up at Versailles. He must listen to the country and stop being so disconnected,\" Binet said on LCI television.\n\nMacron's comments have been met with howls of anger on the left, including from the railway workers' branch of the CGT, which responded by calling for protests on July 18, the day when the newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene.\n\nIt said the protests should take place in front of prefectures, the seats of state authority all around the country, and in front of the National Assembly in Paris, to demand that the NFP form a government.\n\n\"Let's not allow our victory to be stolen from us!,\" its statement concluded.\n\nBinet said \"all of us should take part in these gatherings to keep the National Assembly under scrutiny and ensure that the people's vote is respected,\" hinting that protests could continue during the Olympics if Macron did not comply.\n\nTROUBLE FOR THE GAMES?\n\n\"At this stage, we haven't planned any strikes during the Olympics, but if Macron continues to throw petrol on to the flames,\" she said, without finishing her sentence. The Olympics start on July 26.\n\nOptions for government include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis, with ad hoc agreements.\n\nThe head of the larger, more moderate CFDT union, Marylise Leon, said the NFP's programme should be the starting point for the next government.\n\n\"That's what the citizens voted for. It's important to respect their vote,\" she said on France Inter radio.\n\nNFP leaders have given no sign that they were prepared to break up the bloc, which was hastily assembled to unite the left against the far-right National Rally, which came first in European elections in June and in the first round of the legislative election.\n\nHowever, days of feverish talks have yet to yield a consensus candidate for prime minister from within NFP ranks.\n\nFrance Unbowed leaders have said one of them should get the job on the basis that they won the most seats out of NFP member parties, but the electoral maths is disputed because some lawmakers have yet to declare their allegiance.\n\nThe Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure has put himself forward too, making clear that, like the trade unionists, he believed there should be a left-wing government, not one cobbled together from pieces of the left and of the centre.\n\nFaure portrayed Macron as disconnected from reality, seeking to maintain his people in power despite their electoral loss.\n\n\"Is it imaginable that the government that lost the election should still be in place for Bastille Day, for the Olympics, and why not for the autumn and we can enjoy their company for Christmas while we're at it?,\" he said on France 2 television late on Wednesday.\n\nAdditional reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Writing by Estelle

govt", "body": "Paris (AFP) - French left-wingers attacked President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday after he called for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall majority, the result left France rudderless at home, where it will host the Olympic Games in just over two weeks, and weakened abroad, where President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington for a NATO summit focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an open letter to voters, Macron said Wednesday that \"nobody won\" the ballot.\n\nHe has left centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition.\n\nSocialist Party chief Olivier Faure accused Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people\", while LFI figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon blasted the \"return of the royal veto\".\n\nSophie Binet, head of France's biggest trade union federation, the CGT, also enlisted the image of France's long-defunct monarchy to attack the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she said, referring to the king guillotined in 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\n\"If (Macron) doesn't respect the result of the polls, he risks plunging the country into chaos once again,\" she said.\n\n'Bring people together'\n\nThe president's letter appeared to rule out a role for either LFI -- the largest player in the New Popular Front (NFP) left alliance -- or the far-right National Rally (RN) in the new coalition.\n\nVoters from different camps joined forces in the second-round run-off to shut the RN out of power in a \"republican front\", allowing Macron's followers to claim second place with 164 seats and leaving the far right in third at 143.\n\nWith each of the three blocs controlling roughly one-third of the chamber, it may be a long slog to find a government able to survive a no-confidence vote.\n\n\"We can't form a national unity government with just one camp,\" Macron ally Francois Bayrou told AFP, calling for a prime minister able to \"bring people together\".\n\nThe conservative Republicans party -- once the vehicle of presidents like Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, but now reduced to 40 seats -- has refused to join a government coalition, but says it could vote to adopt a legislative programme.\n\nThree-time RN presidential candidate Marine Le Pen meanwhile dismissed Macron's letter as a \"disgraceful circus\".\n\nHer party now has its eyes firmly on France's next presidential election in 2027, when term limits mean Macron will not be able to stand again.\n\nEconomic fears\n\nMacron arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a NATO summit where allies may now be weighing the prospect of French instability on top of the potential return of NATO-sceptic Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nMacron did not speak to the press at the event.\n\nMarkets are also anxious, with warnings this week from ratings agencies that uncertainty over government finances could lead to credit downgrades for its over three-trillion-euro ($3.25 trillion) debt pile.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned against the left's economic programme without naming the NFP specifically.\n\n\"In the economic competition, our small firms, our companies can't be weighed down with excessive wage costs, including the minimum wage, and by taxes that are too heavy,\" Villeroy told broadcaster Franceinfo.\n\nThe NFP vowed ahead of the polls both to increase the minimum wage and to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy.\n\nRevenue would pay for welfare projects including reversing Macron's widely resented increase to the official retirement age.\n\n\"We spend a lot more than we pay in taxes, including on social spending and pensions,\" Villeroy said.\n\n\"That's what creates the budget deficit,\" he added, after the government overspent by 5.5 percent of GDP last year, well above the EU limit of three percent.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But given that the RN were in striking distance of an absolute majority, this result must sting.\n\nThis is the first time that a party that received over 30 per cent in the first round has failed to win a second round majority. Bardella and Le Pen will retreat to lick their wounds, regroup and come up with a new plan.\n\nMacron will no doubt paint this result as a rejection of the hard right. He and his supporters will also try to paint his snap election gamble as having worked. Don't believe the hype.\n\nThis result is a disaster for Macron and his agenda. Since he absolutely cannot make alliances with the right and the RN, he will need to forge some sort of relationship with the NFP and M\u00e9lanchon.\n\nRemarkably, almost no one paid any attention to M\u00e9lanchon and the NFP during the buildup to Sunday's election. Perhaps they should have, as they would understand why this is no victory for France, and certainly not for Macron.\n\nThe NFP is a coalition of LFI, the Socialist party, the greens and the Communists. Economically, they are left of left. Their proposals include a 35-hour work week, moving to 32 hours following collective bargaining, and the retirement age moved back down to 60.

Unlike Americans, who often seemed strikingly ignorant of history, the French are nurtured on their past. They never cease to invoke the grandeur of their history. From Joan of Arc to Louis XIV to Napoleon to Charles de Gaulle, France's past informs every aspect of France's present. They relish the aesthetics of the monuments to that history and the ideologies that underpin it.\n\nFor France, this is both good and bad.\n\nWithout a profound knowledge of the past, it is difficult to know the foundation of the present or the pathways to the future. History can also serve, however, to entrench us in ideas that may have made sense in the past but may create impediments for the future or become false gods in whom we misplace our faith.\n\nFrance's recent National Assembly elections are a case in point. The outcome strongly suggests the powerful pull of history on contemporary events. It was expected that the Rassemblement National, or the RN, the right-wing group that has evolved from Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National to become a more moderate right-of-center party, would win a majority of the seats in the National Assembly. That did not happen.\n\nInstead, although no party won a majority of the seats and the RN received the largest number of votes, the left-wing coalition, brilliantly named the Nouveau Front Populaire, or the NFP, obtained the greatest number of seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThis is a case where historical memory and the manipulation of names played a prominent and possibly deceitful role. With the RN poised to emerge victorious in the hastily called elections for the National Assembly, a group of left-wing parties quickly united as the NFP in the hope of stopping the momentum of the RN. The choice of the name Nouveau Front Populaire was particularly felicitous, just as the echoes of the Front National in the name Rassemblement National were particularly challenging.\n\nThose who know French history know that the original Front Populaire was a socialist coalition headed by a Jewish journalist named Leon Blum. The Front Populaire headed a short-lived government in the 1930s. But that government instituted many of the social reforms that have become an integral and cherished part of French life, including paid vacations, substantial minimum wages, health care and retirement pensions. Blum himself was arrested by the collaborationist government of Vichy and barely survived incarceration in the concentration camp of Buchenwald.\n\nAs a consequence, the history of the Front Populaire and the memories of that brief period are heavily intertwined with notions of social benefits and resistance to Nazi occupation and collaboration. The opposite is true for the RN. Even though the RN has repeatedly, formally and seemingly sincerely renounced the ideology that spawned fascism and collaboration in the 1930s and 1940s, references to the RN inevitably conjure up images of some of the worst moments of recent French history.\n\nThis dissonance had a great deal to do with the outcome of the recent elections. Confronted with the possibility that the RN might become the governing power in France, the left brought out the ghosts of the past both overtly and covertly. During the very short political campaign, leaders of the NFP ceaselessly hammered on the RN's Front National predecessor and emphasized the Front National's reprehensible history. The press, mostly made up of left-wing journalists, happily joined in the chorus.\n\nThe irony in all of this is that the echoes of the past are not necessarily reflections of the reality of the present. Indeed, the very opposite is true.\n\nThe most prominent leader of the NFP, Jean-Luc Melenchon, is in the mold of populist dictators of the past. He is mean-spirited and disdainful of those who disagree with him. He is infused with the moral certainty that he is right and everyone else is wrong -- a sure formula for tyranny.\n\nMr. Melenchon is unabashedly anti-Israel, deploring anything having to do with Israel and often crossing over into blatantly antisemitic territory. While many on the left have sought to distance themselves from him, he has made certain that he would remain the most prominent leader of this new coalition. At the NFP victory rally last Sunday evening, where he was the standout figure, the Palestinian flag was waved prominently throughout the assembled crowd.\n\nJordan Bardella, the 28-year-old head of the RN, is quite different. So is Marine Le Pen, who, although the daughter of a Holocaust denier and stubborn representative of the old guard, has denounced that past (even ousting her father from her party) and has espoused a philosophy that is far more open-minded and generous of spirit, not to mention very pro-Israel.\n\nAlthough the NFP resonates with the prejudice and intolerance of the past and the RN is infused with a more tolerant attitude, the dictates of history play a powerful role. Captives of the public relations of the past and unable to jettison long-established perspectives on that past, French voters seemingly could not bring themselves to make a judgment-free of the prejudices of history.\n\nAs we are often reminded, a failure to know history is to potentially repeat it. We must not be blind adherents to historical events. We must learn from history, but we must also remain fully cognizant of the realities of the present. Many French voters apparently failed in this regard.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

blasts Macron, demands keys to govt", "body": "France's economy faces an uncertain future after the inconclusive vote\n\nFrench left-wingers attacked President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday after he called for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall majority, the result left France rudderless at home, where it will host the Olympic Games in just over two weeks, and weakened abroad, where President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington for a NATO summit focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an open letter to voters, Macron said Wednesday that \"nobody won\" the ballot.\n\nHe has left centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition.\n\nSocialist Party chief Olivier Faure accused Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people\", while LFI figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon blasted the \"return of the royal veto\".\n\nSophie Binet, head of France's biggest trade union federation, the CGT, also enlisted the image of France's long-defunct monarchy to attack the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she said, referring to the king guillotined in 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\n\"If (Macron) doesn't respect the result of the polls, he risks plunging the country into chaos once again,\" she said.\n\n- 'Bring people together' -\n\nThe president's letter appeared to rule out a role for either LFI -- the largest player in the New Popular Front (NFP) left alliance -- or the far-right National Rally (RN) in the new coalition.\n\nVoters from different camps joined forces in the second-round run-off to shut the RN out of power in a \"republican front\", allowing Macron's followers to claim second place with 164 seats and leaving the far right in third at 143.\n\nWith each of the three blocs controlling roughly one-third of the chamber, it may be a long slog to find a government able to survive a no-confidence vote.\n\n\"We can't form a national unity government with just one camp,\" Macron ally Francois Bayrou told AFP, calling for a prime minister able to \"bring people together\".\n\nMore from this section WATCH: Two men arrested the moment they land at Manchester Airport after fleeing UK following fatal crash

Republicans party -- once the vehicle of presidents like Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, but now reduced to 40 seats -- has refused to join a government coalition, but says it could vote to adopt a legislative programme.\n\nThree-time RN presidential candidate Marine Le Pen meanwhile dismissed Macron's letter as a \"disgraceful circus\".\n\nHer party now has its eyes firmly on France's next presidential election in 2027, when term limits mean Macron will not be able to stand again.\n\n- Economic fears -\n\nMacron arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a NATO summit where allies may now be weighing the prospect of French instability on top of the potential return of NATO-sceptic Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nMacron did not speak to the press at the event.\n\nMarkets are also anxious, with warnings this week from ratings agencies that uncertainty over government finances could lead to credit downgrades for its over three-trillion-euro ($3.25 trillion) debt pile.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned against the left's economic programme without naming the NFP specifically.\n\n\"In the economic competition, our small firms, our companies can't be weighed down with excessive wage costs, including the minimum wage, and by taxes that are too heavy,\" Villeroy told broadcaster Franceinfo.\n\nThe NFP vowed ahead of the polls both to increase the minimum wage and to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy.\n\nRevenue would pay for welfare projects including reversing Macron's widely resented increase to the official retirement age.\n\n\"We spend a lot more than we pay in taxes, including on social spending and pensions,\" Villeroy said.\n\n\"That's what creates the budget deficit,\" he added, after the government overspent by 5.5 percent of GDP last year, well above the EU limit of three percent.\n\nburs-tgb/dc/js", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors":

Members of the alliance have been trying all week to agree on a name and a strategy to govern without a majority.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron must snap out of his denialism. He has lost the election ... He's like Louis XVI holed up at Versailles. He must listen to the country and stop being so disconnected,\" Binet said on LCI television.\n\nMacron's comments have been met with howls of anger on the left, including from the railway workers' branch of the CGT, which responded by calling for protests on July 18, the day when the newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene.\n\nIt said the protests should take place in front of prefectures, the seats of state authority all around the country, and in front of the National Assembly in Paris, to demand that the NFP form a government.\n\n\"Let's not allow our victory to be stolen from us!,\" its statement concluded.\n\nBinet said \"all of us should take part in these gatherings to keep the National Assembly under scrutiny and ensure that the people's vote is respected,\" hinting that protests could continue during the Olympics if Macron did not comply.\n\nTROUBLE FOR THE GAMES?\n\n\"At this stage, we haven't planned any strikes during the Olympics, but if Macron continues to throw petrol on to the flames,\" she said, without finishing her sentence. The Olympics start on July 26.\n\nOptions for government include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis, with ad hoc agreements.\n\nThe head of the larger, more moderate CFDT union, Marylise Leon, said the NFP's programme should be the starting point for the next government.\n\n\"That's what the citizens voted for. It's important to respect their vote,\" she said on France Inter radio.\n\nNFP leaders have given no sign that they were prepared to break up the bloc, which was hastily assembled to unite the left against the far-right National Rally, which came first in European elections in June and in the first round of the legislative election.\n\nHowever, days of feverish talks have yet to yield a consensus candidate for prime minister from within NFP ranks.\n\nFrance Unbowed leaders have said one of them should get the job on the basis that they won the most seats out of NFP member parties, but the electoral maths is disputed because some lawmakers have yet to declare their allegiance.\n\nThe Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure has put himself forward too, making clear that, like the trade unionists, he believed there should be a left-wing government, not one cobbled together from pieces of the left and of the centre.\n\nFaure portrayed Macron as disconnected from reality, seeking to maintain his people in power despite their electoral loss.\n\n\"Is it imaginable that the government that lost the election should still be in place for Bastille Day, for the Olympics, and why not for the autumn and we can enjoy their company for Christmas while we're at it?,\" he said on France 2 television late on Wednesday.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Writing by Estelle

left-wingers attacked President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday after he called for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister.\n\nNo single force won Sunday's second-round vote outright, though a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, with 193 in the 577-strong National Assembly.\n\nWith no overall majority, the result left France rudderless at home, where it will host the Olympic Games in just over two weeks, and weakened abroad, where President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington for a NATO summit focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an open letter to voters, Macron said Wednesday that \"nobody won\" the ballot.\n\nHe has left centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition.\n\nSocialist Party chief Olivier Faure accused Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people\", while LFI figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon blasted the \"return of the royal veto\".\n\nSophie Binet, head of France's biggest trade union federation, the CGT, also enlisted the image of France's long-defunct monarchy to attack the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she said, referring to the king guillotined in 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\n\"If (Macron) doesn't respect the result of the polls, he risks plunging the country into chaos once again,\" she said.\n\nThe president's letter appeared to rule out a role for either LFI -- the largest player in the New Popular Front (NFP) left alliance -- or the far-right National Rally (RN) in the new coalition.\n\nVoters from different camps joined forces in the second-round run-off to shut the RN out of power in a \"republican front\", allowing Macron's followers to claim second place with 164 seats and leaving the far right in third at 143.\n\nWith each of the three blocs controlling roughly one-third of the chamber, it may be a long slog to find a government able to survive a no-confidence vote.\n\n\"We can't form a national unity government with just one camp,\" Macron ally Francois Bayrou told AFP, calling for a prime minister able to \"bring people together\".\n\nThe conservative Republicans party -- once the vehicle of presidents like Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, but now reduced to 40 seats -- has refused to join a government coalition, but says it could vote to adopt a legislative programme.\n\nThree-time RN presidential candidate Marine Le Pen meanwhile dismissed Macron's letter as a \"disgraceful circus\".\n\nHer party now has its eyes firmly on France's next presidential election in 2027, when term limits mean Macron will not be able to stand again.\n\nMacron arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a NATO summit where allies may now be weighing the prospect of French instability on top of the potential return of NATO-sceptic Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nMacron did not speak to the press at the event.\n\nMarkets are also anxious, with warnings this week from ratings agencies that uncertainty over government finances could lead to credit downgrades for its over three-trillion-euro ($3.25 trillion) debt pile.\n\nOn Thursday, Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned against the left's economic programme without naming the NFP specifically.\n\n\"In the economic competition, our small firms, our companies can't be weighed down with excessive wage costs, including the minimum wage, and by taxes that are too heavy,\" Villeroy told broadcaster Franceinfo.\n\nThe NFP vowed ahead of the polls both to increase the minimum wage and to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy.\n\nRevenue would pay for welfare projects including reversing Macron's widely resented increase to the official retirement age.\n\n\"We spend a lot more than we pay in taxes, including on social spending and pensions,\" Villeroy said.\n\n\"That's what creates the budget deficit,\" he added, after the government overspent by 5.5 percent of GDP last year, well above the EU limit of three percent.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_barfield@ibtimes.com", "name": "Tom Barfield", "type": "author",

to pressure President Emmanuel Macron into \"respecting the results\" of recent legislative elections and allow a leftist coalition to form a new government.\n\nFrance has been at the brink of a governing paralysis since Sunday's vote for the National Assembly, the influential lower house of parliament, resulted in a legislature split between three political groupings: the New Popular Front leftist coalition, Mr Macron's centrist allies and the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe New Popular Front alliance won the most seats in the legislature, but fell short of an outright majority to govern on its own.\n\nThe alliance's three main parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, the Socialists and the Greens, have urged the president to turn to them to form the new government.\n\nMs Binet said the president should allow the New Popular Front to form the new government, although the leftists alliance has not yet proposed a candidate for prime minister because of internal divisions.\n\nShe called on union members to take to the streets and \"join rallies to put the National Assembly under surveillance\".\n\n\"There must be popular, citizens' pressure so that the elections' results are respected,\" Ms Binet said.\n\nMr Macron has asked his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to continue handling day-to-day affairs, despite Mr Attal's offer of resignation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Macron said he will wait for the country's political parties to build a \"Republican\" majority at the National Assembly before he can decide on a new prime minister, infuriating the

He must navigate the uncharted waters of cohabitation with a hostile parliament. If he fails, the path is clear for a far-right victory in 2027\n\nA lot is happening in France these days. On July 11, the world's second-ranked French soccer team was narrowly defeated in the semi-final of Euro 2024 by a spirited Spain, with the latter turbocharged by a wonder goal from 16-year-old Lamine Yamal. Meanwhile, the Olympics, the world's biggest sporting extravaganza with 800 events, 15,000 athletes, 45,000 volunteers, and over 2.5 million spectators, is knocking at the doors of Paris. At the same time, the Tour de France, the unique 100-year-old bicycle race, is unfolding alongside the journey of the Olympic Torch.\n\nDespite all these events, it is not a very happy ending for Emmanuel Macron, the President of France who on June 9, within hours of his party's crushing defeat at the hands of Far-Right Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) in the European Parliament elections, had dissolved the National Assembly and called for a two-round snap poll on June 30 and July 7.\n\nHis unexpected decision -- the National Assembly election was not due for another three years -- stunned everyone, including his own deputies and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. The decision also left political parties scrambling against the clock to stitch alliances, nominate candidates, book venues, and plan electoral campaigns.\n\nBut that is Macron -- the great gambler, known for taking significant risks. His propensity for high-stakes manoeuvres was evident in 2017 when, as a 38-year-old political novice, he formed a new centrist party and unexpectedly won the French presidency just a year later.\n\nMacron's latest political gamble has not only put a question mark on his diminishing credibility and authority for the remaining three years of his second term but also thrown France into complete disarray. The final election results have landed the nation in a political dead end with no exit route. The results are unprecedented in the history of the sixty-five-year-old Fifth Republic. I will shortly solve the riddle of what happened, but before that, it is time to tell a small tale of a one-month-old baby.\n\nA month is a long time in politics. A month ago, the New Popular Front alias Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) did not exist in France; the ragtag alliance was cobbled together at the last minute before the election. The four-party coalition comprised primarily two moderate left parties -- the centre-left Socialist Party and the Green Ecological Party -- and two far-left outfits, France Unbowed and the Communist Party.\n\nThe evening he called the elections, in a televised address, Macron described his decision as \"grave, heavy,\" but argued that he could not \"carry on as if nothing had happened.\" And what happened during and after elections, indeed was a tectonic shift. After the first round of elections on June 30, in which the far-right surged, it appeared as though the nation was convulsing in distress. However, with the result of the final round of elections held on July 7, since confirmed by the Interior Ministry, France has warded off the once again -- but the question is for how long. Nonetheless, the second worst has happened.\n\nThe two rounds of elections yielded dramatically different outcomes. The first round, held on June 30, saw Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party alias Rassemblement National (RN) come within striking distance of power. However, after the final round on July 7, the far-right was relegated to third place with 143 seats, trailing behind Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance, which secured 163 seats.\n\nThe real surprise was the performance of the New Popular Front (NFP). This coalition, a cluster of several parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Socialists and Greens, is less than a month old. Despite lacking a common leader and facing internal divisions, the NFP defied expectations, becoming the largest bloc in the National Assembly with 182 seats.\n\nIn France's 577-member National Assembly, a party needs 289 seats to secure an absolute majority. Although the National Rally won the largest share of the vote in the final round of elections (37.8 per cent), it only secured the third-highest number of seats (143), trailing behind Ensemble's 163 seats. The NFP, despite being a recently formed coalition, gained the most seats (182).\n\nThese results highlight a key feature of the French electoral system, where the party winning the most votes doesn't always win the most seats. In this case, the NFP, which received 26.3 per cent of the vote, ended up with more seats than the National Rally, which garnered 37.8 per cent of the vote. Macron's Ensemble alliance won 22.3 per cent of the vote. The remaining parties received a combined 14.1 per cent of the vote, resulting in 84 seats in the Assembly.\n\nThe group that secured the maximum number of seats is the less than one-month-old latest kid on the block, the New Popular Front. The fractured verdict has sent France into a deep cavern, making the country ungovernable. Clearly, between the alternating resurgence of the far-left and far-right, the centre cannot hold.\n\nNone of the three political groupings are anywhere near 289, the number of seats needed for an absolute majority. Also, bereft of a tradition of coalition governance through dialogue, accommodation, and negotiation like India and many European countries, France's Fifth Republic has suddenly landed in absolute chaos and confusion. The problem is compounded by the fact that the animosities within political groups run so deep that the only thing common even among parties within the same grouping, such as the New Popular Front, is mutual disdain for the Far-Right National Rally.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it is apt to dig deeper into what happened this Sunday in France. I call it: all is fair in love, war, and election.\n\nBefore June 30, the only common ground between Macron's Ensemble alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front was a deep-seated mutual animosity. However, a seismic shift occurred as France grappled with the rising tide of the far-right National Rally. In the first round of elections, the far-right National Rally emerged as the most successful bloc, securing 34 per cent of the vote, significantly ahead of Macron's Ensemble, which garnered 21 per cent while the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance with 28.1 per cent was second-ranked.\n\nIn the first round, 76 candidates were elected outright, securing over 50 per cent of the vote in their constituencies. Of these, 38 were from the National Rally and 36 from the New Popular Front. The collapse of support for Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance was evident in their meagre two seats.\n\nThis dramatic shift in the political landscape, particularly the resurgence of the far right, led to the formation of a \"Republic Bloc\" aimed at combating the spectre of a new Vichy France.\n\nNothing unites the French, whose rallying cry is \"libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9,\" more than the real or imaginary fear of the ghost of Vichy France returning to the Fifth Republic. To recap, after the Franco-German Armistice of June 22, 1940, during World War II, the Nazis divided France into two parts: the northern half remained under German occupation, while a puppet regime, Vichy France, was established in the south under Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain.\n\nThe resurgence of the far-right in the latest election led to two opposing blocs, the left and far-left and the centre Ensemble, joining hands to create a cordon sanitaire against the far-right National Rally.\n\nFirst used in 1920, the French term \"cordon sanitaire\" refers to a protective barrier against a potentially aggressive or dangerous influence or ideology. As the results of the first round of elections on June 30 poured in, fuelling fears of a far-right takeover of the National Assembly, the centre, left, and far-left parties quickly formed a \"cordon sanitaire\" against Marine Le Pen's far-right, anti-immigrant National Rally and its 28-year-old potential Prime Minister, Jordan Bardella.\n\nIn a swift action, over 200 candidates from Macron's Ensemble (81) and the New Popular Front (126) withdrew their candidacies before the 6 PM deadline on Tuesday, July 2. This resulted in two-way contests in 409 seats, three-way contests in 89 seats, and four-way contests in merely two seats. The primary aim of these withdrawals was to prevent the National Rally from gaining further ground.\n\nAnd the checkmate worked.\n\nWhile the cordon sanitaire proved effective in containing the spread of the National Rally, it was the left and far-left New Popular Front, rather than Macron's Ensemble, that benefited most. Ensemble lost more than one-third of its seats in the National Assembly compared to the previous election. Nevertheless, the National Rally also made significant gains, securing the highest vote share at 37 per cent and increasing its seat count from eight to 143 from 88 in the just dissolved National Assembly and merely 8 seats two years back.\n\nThe New Popular Front lacks a consensus leader. The left parties fought the election for the European Parliament separately. It is difficult to predict how long the coalition will survive. Nonetheless, the left-wing parties have a clear agenda: raising the minimum wage from 1,400 to 1,600 euros ($1,515 to $1,735), reversing Macron's pension reform which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, and freezing the prices of essential food products and energy. This agenda makes \"cohabitation\" between Ensemble and the New Popular Front highly unlikely.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal, a centrist and ally of Macron who was appointed to the post just seven months ago, has resigned following the election results. However, Macron has not accepted the resignation and has asked him to stay on for now as caretaker Prime Minister, \"in order to ensure the country's stability.\" But the crucial question remains: Where is France headed?\n\nCoalition governments are commonplace in India and many European countries, where compromise governments often rule effectively. However, France has never experienced a period in modern times where the parliament lacks a dominant party. The unprecedented situation of three raucous blocs, none of them ready to do business with each other, will undoubtedly complicate governance for President Emmanuel Macron during the remainder of his term.\n\nAnd the complication is compounded by the fact that before the election Macron was on record saying he would not work with the hard-left France Unbowed party. Four days after the election, he has broken his silence on the election results, centrist-Ensemble will not cohabit with far-left France Unbowed and its mercurial founder M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nEven otherwise, the New Popular Front, while victorious, lacks a leader who is acceptable to all its factions. Trying to fill the leadership vacuum is Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a firebrand hard-left politician and former Trotskyist. The complication has got further compounded with 72-year-old M\u00e9lenchon, the founder of France Unbowed and self-proclaimed spokesperson for the left, who has already declared victory and urged Macron to invite the New Popular Front to form the next government. However, Macron does not want to eat lunch with M\u00e9lenchon, and many within the left-wing coalition also detest his authoritarianism, antisemitism, and anti-Muslim views in a country with Europe's largest Jewish population and one of the largest Muslim populations.\n\nThe truth is that the left's win is neither an endorsement of its policies nor a vote for change like what happened in the UK. Instead, the win stems more from fear of the far-right assuming power and has been stitched together through a fractious, laborious, and extremely painful withdrawal of candidates from the second-round ballot, in many cases against their will.\n\nThe path forward in France remains uncertain. Forming the next government, which could have taken days, is now expected to take weeks. There is no roadmap for navigating this uncharted territory. Macron's attempt to bring together the Socialists and Greens, the \"lesser evil\" of the left-wing parties, to form a government is unlikely to succeed. The New Popular Front (NFP) may well implode under the weight of its internal contradictions. France has little experience in running coalition governments, and even less experience in managing minority governments that rely on precarious no-confidence votes to survive. The possibility of a technocratic national government also appears equally unlikely.\n\nAs President Macron is headed to Washington as a much chastened and weaker president to attend the 75th Summit of NATO, France is in limbo under the leadership of a lame-duck prime minister during Olympics time.\n\nA week ago, the far-right National Rally (RN) had its best shot to form a government in France. Today, it is licking its wounds after finishing third behind the New Popular Front and Ensemble. Despite this setback, the far-right continues its steady rise to power. Two years ago, its seats in the National Assembly increased to 143 in the upcoming lower house.\n\nThe RN, which emerged from the National Front, founded by Marine Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, in 1972, has a checkered past marked by pro-Nazi affiliations, antisemitism, and anti-Muslim views. Le Pen, after changing the party's name and distancing herself from her father, has made the RN more palatable to French voters. However, the recent record voter turnout of 67 per cent to keep RN at bay demonstrates that France is not yet ready to embrace the far-right.\n\nMacron has survived this political upheaval, but he is severely bruised and battered. His current term ends in 2027, and he has categorically stated that he will not step down. However, with no majority in the National Assembly, he will face significant challenges in implementing his domestic agenda. For at least the next year, he cannot dissolve the National Assembly, forcing him into a period of \"cohabitation\" with the opposing majority.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Macron will remain the President of France, with authority over foreign policy, European affairs, and defence. He will continue to negotiate and ratify international treaties and will retain his role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He will also retain control of the nuclear codes.\n\nBut unmistakably, the centre of power, the political gravity, shall decisively shift for the next three years from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the Palais Bourbon. This is a scenario to which France is unaccustomed. Macron may have staved off a far-right takeover this time, but only by a narrow margin. If he can successfully navigate the turbulent waters of \"cohabitation\" for the next three years, it could usher in a new era for Ensemble. However, if he fails, the National Rally could very well end up in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in 2027. As Marine Le Pen recently stated, \"The tide is rising...Our victory is merely postponed.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition.\n\nSocialist Party chief Olivier Faure accused Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people\", while LFI figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon blasted the \"return of the royal veto.\"\n\nSophie Binet, head of France's biggest trade union federation, the CGT, also enlisted the image of France's long-defunct monarchy to attack the president.\n\n\"It's like having Louis XVI locking himself away in Versailles,\" she said, referring to the king guillotined in 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\n\"If [Macron] doesn't respect the result of the polls, he risks plunging the country into chaos once again,\" she said.\n\nThe president's letter appeared to rule out a role for either

Members of the alliance have been trying all week to agree on a name and a strategy to govern without a majority.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron must snap out of his denialism. He has lost the election ... He's like Louis XVI holed up at Versailles. He must listen to the country and stop being so disconnected,\" Binet said on LCI television.\n\nMacron's comments have been met with howls of anger on the left, including from the railway workers' branch of the CGT, which responded by calling for protests on July 18, the day when the newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene.\n\nIt said the protests should take place in front of prefectures, the seats of state authority all around the country, and in front of the National Assembly in Paris, to demand that the NFP form a government.\n\n\"Let's not allow our victory to be stolen from us!,\" its statement concluded.\n\nBinet said \"all of us should take part in these gatherings to keep the National Assembly under scrutiny and ensure that the people's vote is respected,\" hinting that protests could continue during the Olympics if Macron did not comply.\n\nTROUBLE FOR THE GAMES?\n\n\"At this stage, we haven't planned any strikes during the Olympics, but if Macron continues to throw petrol on to the flames,\" she said, without finishing her sentence. The Olympics start on July 26.\n\nOptions for government include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis, with ad hoc agreements.\n\nThe head of the larger, more moderate CFDT union, Marylise Leon, said the NFP's programme should be the starting point for the next government.\n\n\"That's what the citizens voted for. It's important to respect their vote,\" she said on France Inter radio.\n\nNFP leaders have given no sign that they were prepared to break up the bloc, which was hastily assembled to unite the left against the far-right National Rally, which came first in European elections in June and in the first round of the legislative election.\n\nHowever, days of feverish talks have yet to yield a consensus candidate for prime minister from within NFP ranks.\n\nFrance Unbowed leaders have said one of them should get the job on the basis that they won the most seats out of NFP member parties, but the electoral maths is disputed because some lawmakers have yet to declare their allegiance.\n\nThe Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure has put himself forward too, making clear that, like the trade unionists, he believed there should be a left-wing government, not one cobbled together from pieces of the left and of the centre.\n\nFaure portrayed Macron as disconnected from reality, seeking to maintain his people in power despite their electoral loss.\n\n\"Is it imaginable that the government that lost the election should still be in place for Bastille Day, for the Olympics, and why not for the autumn and we can enjoy their company for Christmas while we're at it?,\" he said on France 2 television late on Wednesday.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Writing by Estelle

Clearly, he failed. The election produced no parliamentary majority, only a great deal more confusion. With many losers and very few winners, it is the most astonishing election in the country's modern history.\n\nAmong the many losers is National Rally (RN), the far-right party that clinched a decisive and shocking victory in the European elections just weeks earlier. Though RN has increased its seat count and emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly, it fell far short of expectations. The second round featured a powerful anti-RN mobilization, as voters shifted tactically from the center to the left, and from the right to the center. Many French apparently concluded during the campaign that RN's candidates were ill prepared to hold power.\n\nMost pundits had come to believe that the French electoral system's natural immunity against the far right no longer worked. But this election disproved that. Though the far right is now the country's leading political force, it cannot do anything without allies, and it has none.\n\nThe second loser is Macron, whose party lost around 100 seats. Before the election, his Ensemble grouping could anchor a relative majority. Now, it is dwarfed by the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), which won the most seats overall.\n\nBut while Macron probably will be forced to appoint a new prime minister from the left, the NFP remains around 100 seats short of an absolute majority. Moreover, it is a loose coalition whose members disagree on much and whose leader, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of France Unbowed, has only one objective: to radicalize public debate and create the conditions for a face-off between him and RN's Marine Le Pen in the 2027 presidential election. Thus, it is not necessarily in M\u00e9lenchon's interest for a left-wing government (under a different figurehead) to succeed.\n\nTo benefit M\u00e9lenchon personally, the NFP would need to be able to execute on its entire electoral program; but that will never happen without an absolutely majority. Moreover, the next government - whatever shape it takes - will soon have to answer to the European Commission, which recently launched an \"excessive deficit procedure\" against France.\n\nStill, the NFP is not likely to break up anytime soon. While the Socialists and Greens drew much criticism for allying with M\u00e9lenchon despite their fundamental differences with him, the arrangement paid off electorally. Of the 40 additional seats won by the left, all went to the Socialists and Greens, whereas France Unbowed made no new gains. One is reminded of the left-wing union that French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand led after his election in 1981: by forging an alliance with the Communists, he was in a better position to weaken them later.\n\nLooking ahead, the most likely scenario is that a moderate minority government will be formed to serve as a caretaker for the next year (the president cannot dissolve the National Assembly again until June 2025). But with Macron on the defensive and lacking a parliamentary majority, France will be in uncharted waters. Specific political personalities will play a much larger role than labels like \"left,\" \"right,\" or \"center.\" As in every political system, some French politicians want to pursue stability and compromise, while others are bent on crushing perceived enemies.\n\nThus, the coming year will be marked by deep political uncertainty, which will not help France's economic outlook. No matter what, though, the next government must agree on the 2025 budget within the next few months.\n\nPerhaps the new National Assembly will find some common ground on electoral reform. The current two-round procedure is suited for a bipolar political system, but this election provided further confirmation that French politics is now tripolar. Given the emergence of distinct left-wing, right-wing, and centrist blocs, the only solution is to introduce proportional representation, with each party establishing its level of support and then pursuing voluntary coalitions after the votes are counted. Within the left, for example, the Socialists would not have to tie themselves to France Unbowed to get elected, and they could form alliances with others - such as Macron's party - once in parliament.\n\nFrance's fragmented politics are not so different from those of other European countries. But its political culture and institutions are unique in the degree to which they favor confrontation over coalition-building.\n\nWill this election outcome spur French politicians to see things differently, or will everyone just keep behaving as they always have? In the latter scenario, RN need only bide its time, capitalize on the government's ineffectiveness, and sooner or later win everything.", "source": {"uri": "stabroeknews.com", "dataType": "news",

The aim is to pressure President Emmanuel Macron into respecting the results of recent legislative elections and allowing a leftist coalition to form a new government.\n\nFrance has been teetering on the edge of governmental paralysis following Sunday's National Assembly vote, which resulted in a split legislature among three main political groups: the New Popular Front leftist coalition, Macron's centrist allies, and Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally. The New Popular Front won the most seats but failed to secure an outright majority.\n\nIn an interview with broadcaster France Inter, Binet said that without respecting the election results, Macron risks plunging the country into chaos.

The \"extreme right\" to which Macron refers -- Le Pen's National Rally (RN), which actually has pretty left-wing economic views, but is in favour of border control -- came first place in both rounds of the election in votes cast, rather making a mockery of the President's claim.\n\nIn a result which has inevitably seen questions raised about the suitability of the 1958-vintage French election system for modern voting preferences, RN came first in votes but came third in seats. Macron's group, meanwhile, came third in votes but second in seats.\n\nEmmanuel Macron Warns of 'Civil War' in France if Public Votes for Populists https://t.co/EHMzEX6IsS\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 25, 2024\n\nHaving failed in his gambit to strengthen his own group in the French Parliament and now faced with a left wing bloc as the largest group he warned just weeks ago would lead to \"civil war\" if they got near power, Macron appears to be playing for time to find a way out. Meanwhile, the hard-left leader M\u00e9lenchon accuses Macron of trying to subvert democracy -- a brave take for a man in his position.\n\nStating the obvious but skirting around his role in apparently having called the election in a tantrum after his party received a drubbing at last month's European Union elections, Macron told the nation: \"no one won. No political force obtains a sufficient majority on its own and the blocs or coalitions that emerge from these elections are all minorities... As President of the Republic, I am both the protector of the higher interests of the Nation and the guarantor of the institutions and of respect for your choice... Last Sunday, you called for the invention of a new French political culture. For you, I will ensure this. In your name, I will be its guarantor.\"\n\nIn all, President Macron said, he would not be appointing a new Prime Minister until the new political forces had \"some time\". The old government would remain on in the meanwhile, he said.\n\nMacron's pretty words aside, research published on Wednesday suggests the French people themselves see through the claims and are not satisfied with the state of affairs. French broadcaster BFMTV reports their new polling which states a clear majority of French at 65 per cent think Macron calling early elections was a bad idea, and even more, around 70 per cent, say they aren't happy with the indecisive results of the election itself.\n\nAs for the political stitch-ups contracted in the second round of the election to keep Le Pen's RN out at all costs -- leading to the strange situation where her party has most votes but few seats -- over half of French are said to call this situation to be scheming and \"unnatural\".\n\nThe radical leader of the left wing bloc that did come first in seats Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon was even more forthright on Wednesday night, outright rejecting Macron's letter to the people, calling it a denial of democracy. \"The president refuses to recognize the result of the polls\", he said, accusing Macron of attempting to wield a \"royal veto\" over the voters by refusing to accept the fact the left wing coalition got the most seats.\n\nM\u00e9lenchon compared Macron's \"intrigues\" to the dying days of the last French Republic and demanded President Macron \"bow down and call the New Popular Front. This is simply democracy.\" On the other hand, President of the French Senate G\u00e9rard Larcher takes the opposite view, reminding the public of the left's very low vote share, despite their strong turnout of new members of Parliament.\n\nSpeaking on French television on Thursday morning, Larcher said if President Macron does invite the left-wing bloc New Popular Front to form a government,: \"I will fight this choice and I will ask that the government be censured. I will call on my friends to censure this government, because it does not correspond to the deep will of the French people\".", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_jj_lane@breitbart.com", "name": "Oliver Jj Lane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_M\u00e9lenchon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rard_Larcher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rard Larcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/GettyImages-2160718837-e1720685867806.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722719", "eventUri": "eng-9722719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Any other machinations would be truly problematic and dangerous for democracy,\" said one of them, Eric Coquerel, on LCI television.\n\nTONE HARDENS\n\nFinancial markets, the European Commission and France's euro zone partners are all watching closely to see whether the impasse can be broken.\n\nOptions include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis, with ad hoc agreements.\n\nBut any government - of the left, centre, or a broader coalition - could quickly be toppled by a confidence vote from the opposition if it had not secured sufficient support.\n\nRN leader Jordan Bardella said Macron was to blame for the political paralysis.\n\n\"And now his message is: 'sort something out'. Irresponsible!\" he posted on X, referring to Macron's letter.\n\nBardella's mentor, the long-time RN leader Marine Le Pen, has spent the last few years cleaning up the image of a party once known for racism and antisemitism, and must now decide what strategy to adopt to win the 2027 presidential election.\n\nShe has framed the tactical withdrawals as an establishment plot to keep her party from power.\n\nOn Wednesday her tone hardened, when she drew parallels between a hard-left politician's call for a march towards the prime minister's office and the assault on Capitol Hill by supporters of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nShe said the NFP has almost \"subversive attitudes since they are calling for Matignon to be taken by force,\" referring to the prime minister's office. \"It's their assault on the Capitol.\"\n\nShe was reacting to a social media post by France Unbowed lawmaker Adrien Quatennens, who accused Macron of wanting to \"steal\" the left's victory after he asked centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to stay on for now, for stability. Quatennens had called for \"a big popular march\" on Matignon.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_France_Insoumise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La France Insoumise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_French_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017 French presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Quatennens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrien Quatennens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/06/25/macron_01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722719", "eventUri": "eng-9722719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

to form a new government.\n\nFrance has been at the brink of a governing paralysis since Sunday's vote for the National Assembly, the influential lower house of parliament, resulted in a legislature split between three political groupings: the New Popular Front leftist coalition, Mr Macron's centrist allies and the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe New Popular Front alliance won the most seats in the legislature, but fell short of an outright majority to govern on its own.\n\nThe alliance's three main parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, the Socialists and the Greens, have urged the president to turn to them to form the new government.\n\nSophie Binet, the general secretary of the CGT union, said in an interview with broadcaster France Inter that if Mr Macron did not respect the results of the election, \"he risks once again plunging the country into chaos\".\n\nMs Binet said the president should allow the New Popular Front to form the new government, although the leftists alliance has not yet proposed a candidate for prime minister because of internal divisions.\n\nShe called on union members to take to the streets and \"join rallies to put the National Assembly under surveillance\".\n\n\"There must be popular, citizens' pressure so that the elections' results are respected,\" Ms Binet said.\n\nMr Macron has asked his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to continue handling day-to-day affairs, despite Mr Attal's offer of resignation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Macron said he will wait for the country's political parties to build a \"Republican\" majority at the National Assembly before he can decide on a new prime minister, infuriating the leftist coalition and the unions.\n\nThe new legislature's inaugural session is scheduled for July 18.", "source":

Despite the overwhelming support for Marine Le Pen's National Rally, the left's strategic maneuvers ensured they didn't secure a majority.\n\nThe French election results created a rift between what the electorate voted for, and what they actually got. Although Le Pen's National Rally (RN) secured the highest number of votes, it ended up with the third most seats. According to the French Interior Ministry, RN won over 8.7 million votes, accounting for 32.05% of the total vote. Combined with their electoral alliance partners from Eric Ciotti's Les R\u00e9publicains, who garnered nearly 1.4 million votes (5%), the right-wing bloc amassed over 10 million votes or 37.05%.\n\nBy contrast, the far-left New Popular Front alliance of communists, socialists, and environmentalists led by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon received around 7 million votes (25.7%), and Emmanuel Macron's neo-liberal centrist coalition received 6.3 million votes (23.15%).\n\nHowever, despite RN receiving 1.7 million more votes than the New Popular Front, the left-wing alliance was awarded the most seats, projected by Le Monde at 182. Macron's coalition won an estimated 168 seats, while RN and its partners were awarded only 143 seats.\n\nThis significant discrepancy between vote share and seat allocation stems from a highly questionable backroom deal between Macron and the New Popular Front. The agreement involved each side dropping out in favor of the candidate with the best chance of defeating the populist RN in over 200 legislative districts. This \"alliance of dishonor\" effectively blocked the populists from gaining a majority despite their clear lead in votes.\n\nJordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of the National Rally, condemned the \"alliance of dishonor\" for undermining the will of the people and accused Macron and M\u00e9lenchon of throwing France into the hands of the radical left.\n\nDespite the setback, Marine Le Pen remains optimistic. \"Two years ago, we had just seven MPs. Tonight RN is the first party in France in terms of MP numbers,\" she said. Indeed, while Macron's coalition and the New Popular Front boast more seats collectively, RN stands as the only single party to have over 100 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nAdding to the political drama, Marion Mar\u00e9chal, niece of Marine Le Pen, who recently secured a seat in the European Parliament in the 2024 elections, made a notable appearance on French television. Mar\u00e9chal emphasized the ungovernability of France in the current political landscape. She criticized the assembly as unrepresentative, stating, \"France is on the right, and it will be governed by the left.\" She highlighted the alignment between Macronists and the far-left bloc, which she claimed does not reflect the true sentiments of the French populace. Mar\u00e9chal argued that on key issues like immigration, security, and economic policies, the French lean right, yet the current political maneuvering has resulted in a left-leaning government.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republicans_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republicans (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_M\u00e9lenchon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9ric_Ciotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9ric Ciotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoliberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Le Monde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Mar\u00e9chal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marion Mar\u00e9chal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722719", "eventUri": "eng-9722719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

political force obtained a sufficient majority and the blocs or coalitions that emerged from these elections were all in the minority,\" Macron said, in a letter published in the regional press.\n\nMarine Le Pen's far right National Rally (RN) won the first round of voting on June 30, but centrist and left-wing parties agreed scores of local pacts to defeat her on the second round.\n\nRunoff results left a loose left-wing alliance -- the New Popular Front (NFP) -- with the most MPs, but no ideological grouping has the outright majority needed to form a government.\n\nMacron said the new government would need to be built by \"republican forces\" supportive of the rule of law, France's role in the European project, national independence and parliamentary rule.\n\nThis formulation appeared designed to exclude Le Pen's RN, but also implicitly far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon's France Unbowed (LFI), a big portion of the NFP's left-wing alliance.\n\n\"It is in light of these principles that I will decide on the appointment of the prime minister,\" Macron said, in a letter published just over two weeks before Paris hosts the

continue to exercise its responsibilities and will then take care of day-to-day business in accordance with republican tradition.\n\n\"Let us place our hope in the ability of our political leaders to

brings more questions than answers for Macron\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron may have seen the far-right National Rally party, or RN, relegated to third place in the country's national assembly election at the weekend, but he still faces a major headache over the makeup of the country's next government.\n\nMacron's centrist coalition Ensemble finished second behind the hastily-concocted New Popular Front alliance of parties of the left, or NFP, with RN in third.\n\nNone of them won the 289 seats needed for an outright majority, so now a round of horse-trading is taking place as people look to build alliances.\n\nMacron is safe in his role as president, but faces having to contend with a new parliament no more sympathetic to him than the one before he called the snap election.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal has offered his resignation, but Macron has asked him to remain in office until the post-election fog clears.\n\nMathilde Panot, parliamentary leader of one of the NFP parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, said Macron should \"bow to the choice of the ballot box\" and let the NFP take over.\n\nCommunist Party leader Fabien Roussel told newspaper Midi Libre that the NFP bloc was \"the most numerous, ready to sit and work with the program presented to the electorate ... we are asking the President of the Republic to let us govern\".\n\nRoussell

The left-wing alliance, known as the New Popular Front, insisted it had the mandate to nominate a prime minister, while the center-right Republicans vowed to bring down a left-led government.\n\nThe positions show that there's little clear way through the impasse that emerged after the shock results of Sunday's parliamentary elections. The French National Assembly was left split among three main factions after voters thwarted the far-right National Rally's bid to take power.\n\nAfter days of silence, Macron finally weighed in with his first substantive statement on the deadlock. In a letter published in France's regional press on Wednesday, he acknowledged that the vote had demonstrated \"a clear demand for change and for power-sharing,\" urging lawmakers \"to build a broad-based partnership.\"\n\n\"I call on all political forces that recognize themselves in republican institutions, the rule of law, parliamentarianism, a European orientation and the defense of French independence, to engage in sincere and loyal dialog to build a solid majority, necessarily diverse, for the country,\" he said.\n\nThe hung parliament has left Macron with his power hemmed in. While it appeared that he might look either to the center-left or to the center-right to construct a workable alliance, he instead appears to be trying to court both at the same time. It's a gambit he tried in 2022, and it didn't work for him then.\n\nHis definition of appropriate parties in effect excludes the far-left France Unbowed. Mathilde Panot, who leads the party in the National Assembly, said Macron's letter was \"shocking.\"\n\nShe called on Macron to accept that the left had won the vote and said the NFP is working on a single candidate to put forward for the post of prime minister and that Macron must nominate this person.\n\n\"We have a democratic result,\" she said Thursday on Franceinfo radio. \"It's not possible to change the rules when the result doesn't suit you.\"\n\nOlivier Faure, head of the Socialist party, sounded a similar note, accusing Macron of failing to \"respect the vote of the French people.\"\n\nWhile the left alliance stuck together, Bruno Retailleau -- the leader of the Republicans in the Senate -- rejected the idea of a left-led government. He urged Macron to pick a neutral premier from outside the National Assembly, warning that if a candidate is chosen from the left-wing alliance, his party would launch a motion of no-confidence to try to bring down the government.\n\nUnder the French constitution, Macron has the prerogative to appoint the prime minister, but threats to topple the government make the choice delicate. In his letter, the president said he'd wait to name a prime minister in order to give the discussions a chance to bear fruit.\n\nAs jockeying intensifies, concerns about the country's path triggered a warning by Bank of France Governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau. He said the country can't afford to keep increasing the deficit or burden companies with more taxes and costs, highlighting the uncertainty created for the economy by the political drama.\n\n\"As we exit the inflation shock, unfortunately there's another shock threatening - an uncertainty shock,\" he told Franceinfo radio on Thursday. \"Business leaders are telling us they are worried about the wait-and-see approach of their customers who are choosing to save instead of spend, about delay of investment, and about freezing hiring.\"\n\nAfter Sunday's second round of voting, the New Popular Front -- which includes France Unbowed, the Socialists, the Greens and the Communists -- has the most lawmakers in the lower house of parliament after an unexpected surge. But it's still around 100 seats short of an outright majority in the 577-seat lower house. The unprecedented outcome means deal-making to try to form a lasting government.\n\nMacron said in his letter that the current government will continue to operate in the interim, and work is continuing. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire sent 2024 spending limits to ministries on Thursday and said he has instigated technical work for the 2025 budget, although it will be up to the next government to decide on that.\n\n\"Either we continue with savings and repairing public finances, or we massively increase taxes on French people,\" Le Maire said. \"It's the only alternative, failing which we would expose ourselves to a very strong market reaction.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The left-wing alliance, known as the New Popular Union, insisted it had the mandate to appoint a prime minister, while the center-right Republicans pledged to topple a left-led government.\n\nGiven the positions of the party leaders, there seems to be no resolution in sight after the impasse that arose following Sunday's parliamentary elections. The French National Assembly was left divided among three main factions, as voters did not trust the far-right National Rally to take power.\n\nAfter days of silence, Macron finally made his first substantive statement on the murky political landscape. In a letter published yesterday in the French press, the centrist president admitted that the vote showed \"a clear demand for change and for the distribution of power,\" urging MPs to \"build a broad partnership.\"\n\n\"I invite all political forces that recognize themselves in democratic institutions, the rule of law, parliamentarism, European orientation, and the defense of French independence, to engage in a sincere and loyal dialogue to build a stable majority, necessarily different for the country,\" he stated in his letter.\n\nThe hung parliament without a strong majority left Macron with limited power. While it appeared he could turn to either the center-left or the center-right to build a workable alliance, Macron seems to be \"flirting\" with both simultaneously, Bloomberg notes. It's a tactic he tried in 2022, and it didn't work then.\n\nHowever, his definition of suitable parties excludes the far-left \"Unsubmissive France\" led by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. Mathilde Panot, head of the party in the National Assembly, said Macron's letter was \"shocking.\" She called on Macron to accept that the Left won the election, stressing that the New Popular Union is working on a single candidate for prime minister and that the French president should nominate that person. \"We have a democratic result,\" Panot told Franceinfo radio today.\n\n\"It is not possible to change the rules when the result does not suit you,\" said Olivier Faure, head of the Socialist Party, accusing Macron of not \"respecting the vote of the French people.\"\n\nWhile the left alliance remained united, Bruno Retailleau - the Republican leader in the Senate - rejected the idea of a government led by the Left. He also urged Macron to choose a neutral prime minister from outside the National Assembly, warning that if a candidate from the leftist alliance is chosen, his party will table a no-confidence motion to try to topple the government.\n\nUnder the French constitution, Macron has the prerogative to appoint the prime minister, but threats to overthrow the government limit his options. In his letter, the French president said he would wait to name a prime minister to give the parties' talks a chance to bear fruit.\n\nAs the post-election search for suitable candidates heats up, concerns about the country's trajectory have worried Bank of France Governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau.\n\nHe argued that the country cannot afford to continue increasing the deficit or burdening businesses with more taxes and costs, highlighting the uncertainty that the political chaos is creating in the economy. \"As we emerge from the shock of inflation, we are unfortunately threatened by another shock - a shock of uncertainty,\" the governor of the Bank of France told Franceinfo radio today.\n\nAfter Sunday's runoff, the New Popular Union - which includes France Unsubmissive, the Socialists, the Greens, and the Communists - has the most seats in the National Assembly (577 seats) after an unexpected surge.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType":

Members of the alliance have been trying all week to agree on a name and a strategy to govern without a majority.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron must snap out of his denialism. He has lost the election ... He's like Louis XVI holed up at Versailles. He must listen to the country and stop being so disconnected,\" Binet said on LCI television.\n\nMacron's comments have been met with howls of anger on the left, including from the railway workers' branch of the CGT, which responded by calling for protests on July 18, the day when the newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene.\n\nIt said the protests should take place in front of prefectures, the seats of state authority all around the country, and in front of the National Assembly in Paris, to demand that the NFP form a government.\n\n\"Let's not allow our victory to be stolen from us!,\" its statement concluded.\n\nBinet said \"all of us should take part in these gatherings to keep the National Assembly under scrutiny and ensure that the people's vote is respected,\" hinting that protests could continue during the Olympics if Macron did not comply.\n\n\"At this stage, we haven't planned any strikes during the Olympics, but if Macron continues to throw petrol on to the flames,\" she said, without finishing her sentence. The Olympics start on July 26.\n\nOptions for government include a broad coalition, a minority government or a technocratic government led by a non-politically affiliated person, which would seek to pass laws in parliament on a case-by-case basis, with ad hoc agreements.\n\nThe head of the larger, more moderate CFDT union, Marylise Leon, said the NFP's programme should be the starting point for the next government.\n\n\"That's what the citizens voted for. It's important to respect their vote,\" she said on France Inter radio.\n\nNFP leaders have given no sign that they were prepared to break up the bloc, which was hastily assembled to unite the left against the far-right National Rally, which came first in European elections in June and in the first round of the legislative election.\n\nHowever, days of feverish talks have yet to yield a consensus candidate for prime minister from within NFP ranks.\n\nFrance Unbowed leaders have said one of them should get the job on the basis that they won the most seats out of NFP member parties, but the electoral maths is disputed because some lawmakers have yet to declare their allegiance.\n\nThe Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure has put himself forward too, making clear that, like the trade unionists, he believed there should be a left-wing government, not one cobbled together from pieces of the left and of the centre.\n\nFaure portrayed Macron as disconnected from reality, seeking to maintain his people in power despite their electoral loss.\n\n\"Is it imaginable that the government that lost the election should still be in place for Bastille Day, for the Olympics, and why not for the autumn and we can enjoy their company for Christmas while we're at it?,\" he said on France 2 television late on Wednesday.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Writing by Estelle

He gave an inspiring speech offering a new political settlement to reunite the French, calling on his nation to be steadfast and confident in its greatness.\n\nCorrection: Macron did nothing of the kind. Instead, far away at the NATO summit in Washington, he sent a desperate letter to local newspapers promising that something will turn up. Eventually.\n\nWhat Macron is hoping for now remains enigmatic and implausible\n\nThis letter to the electorate is the most tone-deaf declaration so far from a president who has led France into a political swamp. It's the equivalent of Winston Churchill announcing in the Hastings Chronicle that Britain will fight on the beaches -- with buckets and spades.\n\n\"No one won\" the election, claimed Macron disingenuously. Although in truth the left did win, and he lost.\n\nThe president \"is in a denial of reality,\" declared Manon Aubry, a M\u00e9lenchoniste MEP, if he imagines \"building a solid majority.\"\n\nCNEWS -- the dissident news channel owned by Vincent Bollor\u00e9 that the government media regulator Arcom is threatening to drive off the airwaves for declining to toe the line -- was contemptuous:\n\nThe Head of State, mute since the second round, said that \"no one won\" and called for \"a wide gathering\" of \"republican forces\", asking the French to \"leave them a little time\". Thus, \"the current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities.\"\n\nM\u00e9lenchon last night declared:\n\nUnique in the democratic world: the president refuses to recognize the result of the ballot that placed the Nouveau Front Populaire at the top of the votes and seats in the Assembly. This is the return of the royal right of veto on universal suffrage. He claims to give time to form another coalition by trickery after the elections! This is the return of the intrigues of the Fourth Republic. That's enough. He must bow and call the Nouveau Front Populaire. It's simply democracy.\n\nMarine Le Pen, wallowing in the humiliation of her enemy, said: \"If I understand correctly, in his letter, Emmanuel Macron proposes to block the Nouveau Front Populaire that he himself helped to get elected three days ago. This circus is becoming disgraceful.\"\n\nInternational pundits (including many in London, Berlin and Brussels) on Monday were cheerfully declaring that Macron had won his bet by calling elections in which, in alliance with the left, he pushed Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National to the sidelines. Mort de rire (dying laughing) as they say here.\n\nWhat Macron is hoping for now remains enigmatic and implausible. The Elys\u00e9e is briefing that discussions will continue to cobble together a centrist government, excluding extremes, and this might take some time.\n\nMacron's carrots are cooked. As Andrew Neil has pointed out, the biggest group in the new Assembly is the Left Alliance (NFP) which has 182 seats. But that is made up of four distinct parties. M\u00e9lenchon's hard left have seventy-four, the Socialists fifty-nine, the Greens twenty-eight, and the Communists nine. The next biggest group is Macron's centrists, with 168 seats. This is made up of four elements: Macron's party on 102, various Democratic centrists on thirty-three, the Horizon Party of former prime minister \u00c9douarde Philippe on twenty-five and eight other seats.\n\nThen there's the right-wing Rassemblement National with 143 seats, made up of two groups. There's also the center-right Republicans, with forty-six seats and a hodgepodge of smaller parties with thirty-nine seats between them. The single largest party in the assembly is Marine's, which took 37 percent of the popular vote. With a smaller share of the vote, the Labour Party in the UK just seized complete control of Parliament. Democracy works in mysterious ways.\n\nAt least 289 is needed in the Assembly for a majority. Macron has a potential pool of 168 -- although even that is shaky as the leader of the right-wing faction of the Republicans said this morning that he wouldn't play ball. The ability to count is indispensable in politics but for Macron, supposedly the Mozart of finance, the sums don't add up.\n\nAll the perfumes on sale in the chichi boutiques of the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 cannot hide the stench of Macron's failure. His maneuverings have reduced his centre to ruins, embiggened the loony left, privileged the right with immunity for the shambles and created an Assembly dominated by furious leftists.\n\nHis cunning plan has let his enemy Marine Le Pen snatch a victory from defeat. She is now revelling in a catastrophe wrought by the president for which she bears zero responsibility, other than her insolence in having thrashed Macron in the European elections in early June and subsequently taking 37 percent of the vote in the Assembly elections that followed.\n\nMacron continues to evade all responsibility for the disaster his dissolving the National Assembly caused. With his hissy fit he has destroyed his own credibility, threatened the credit of France, and invited ultra-leftist extremists to imagine they are entitled to form a government.\n\nEven the Macron-friendly Le Monde, quintessential organ of the bien-pensant Paris bubble, is struggling to hold its nerve:\n\nEmmanuel Macron arrived behind the scenes at the NATO summit, without a word or a look for journalists. The tenant of the Elys\u00e9e thinks he has put more than an ocean between him and the political crisis that is shaking his country.\n\nIf this is an accurate description of Macron's state of mind, his insouciance is chilling.\n\nWe will celebrate Bastille Day on Saturday and in my own commune will cheer the Tour de France as it whizzes by. The mayor will give prizes to the new baccalaureates. And a glass or two will be shared in the Place de la R\u00e9publique. A calm amid the tempest. But even here in deepest France, people are on edge. A poll published this morning shows eight out of ten French people are anxious about the current political situation.\n\nThe Olympic Games open in Paris in fifteen days, a juicy target should the frustrated left descend on the streets. The Games were supposed to be the ultimate global stage for Macron to strut. Now they're the stage for a summer of discontent.\n\nThe president's rash promise to swim in the Seine to prove it is safe for open-water swimming remains unfulfilled, because all the tests show the river remains hopelessly fouled with human feces. If he does dare take to the still-contaminated waters, it will be a perfect metaphor for a presidency that has plunged into a sewer.", "source": {"uri": "thespectator.com", "dataType": "news",

The alliance's three main parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, the Socialists and the Greens, have urged the president to turn to them to form the new government.\n\nSophie Binet, the general secretary of the CGT union, said in an interview with broadcaster France Inter Thursday that if Macron did not respect the results of the election, \"he risks once again plunging the country into chaos.\"\n\nBinet said the president should allow the New Popular Front to form the new government, although the leftists alliance has not yet proposed a candidate for prime minister because of internal divisions. She called on union members to take to the streets and \"join rallies to put the National Assembly under surveillance.\"\n\n\"There must be popular, citizens' pressure so that the elections' results are respected,\" Binet said.\n\nMacron has asked his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to continue handling day-to-day affairs, despite Attal's offer of resignation. On Wednesday, Macron said he will wait for the country's political parties to build a \"Republican\" majority at the National Assembly before he can decide on a new prime minister, infuriating the leftist coalition and the unions.\n\nThe new legislature's inaugural session is scheduled for July 18.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's global election coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/ and

The best that can be said is that there will not be a Rassemblement led government during the Olympics. The risk now is of ongoing political uncertainty and friction, and in the context of a move towards the far-left (some of whose worst instincts encompass support for Hamas and 90% income tax rates), a confrontation with bond markets.\n\nThe takeaway of the election is that the Rassemblement has not triumphed. A number of factors have played a role here. In the past couple of weeks, tv and radio interviews have exposed the lack of real policy knowledge of Jordan Bardella (notably revealing his comments on the rights of bi-nationals), not to mention the incoherence of many of his RN colleagues.\n\nIn addition, tactical voting across the country has managed to limit the advance of the RN (who are now engaging in the familiar cry that 'the election has been stolen'). Bear in mind that the RN won 37% of the votes but will have fewer seats than the far-left NFP group who garnered 27% of the vote, which shows the power of tactical voting but also should sound a warning ahead of the presidential elections (2027).\n\nThere are several strands emerging. The first is that while Macron has avoided a RN majority, he has ushered it into the mainstream of French politics, crippled his own party and resurrected the far-left in France. He remains severely diminished in the sense that the majority of French people resent him, prior political allies from Edouard Philippe to Gabriel Attal are distancing him, and that political power will now pass to parliament.\n\nAttention will now turns to the formation of a government. The French constitution doesn't offer a clear guide here - it is set up to shape majority governments. There are perhaps three scenarios to bear in mind.\n\n- A technocratic government of experts and well-regarded figures in public life. This scenario is a low probability one for the moment, at least until other possibilities are exhausted.\n\n- An NFP centred government, with 'silent support' of the centre. We think this would be difficult to achieve given the policy programme of the La France Insoumise in particular, and they would have to severely moderate this and give up the chance for Jean-Luc Melanchon to serve in government (everyone is against this).\n\n- A 'grand coalition' government of the centre, which is enabled by the breaking of the socialists with LFI to join Renew and possibly the Greens/Ecolos, and some of the right wing deputies. This 'German' style government could come close to a slim majority but would necessitate a break in the left wing coalition. The difficulty for Macron would be the role that Francois Hollande might play, the concessions he would need to give to the Greens and the choice of prime minister.\n\nAt the time of writing, the far-left is insisting that it will propose a candidate for prime minister, but it is so far searching for an acceptable name.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGabriel Attal has submitted his resignation which has been refused by the president - and we suspect that this government could be kept in place till after the Olympics, with a lot of manoeuvring going on at the same time. The only template for a caretaker government is 1958, when it lasted 9 days.\n\nThe leader of the Assembl\u00e9e will be selected on the 18 July, and then September looms in terms of a budget.\n\nEconomically, a new government could be less coherent, less experienced (Bruno Le Maire was in place for seven years) and will want to spend more, with a possibility (esp if the NFP is involved) that it will be instinctively less friendly to investment and capital markets. As such, France is up against the limits of fiscal space, and the risk of a run in with the bond market is high.\n\nIn sum, this was a very costly move by Macron. France and its parliament is divided, the far-left is in a powerful position in parliament, the far-right has garnered 37% of the vote and there are growing financial risks to the political outlook in France.

He gave an inspiring speech offering a new political settlement to reunite the French, calling on his nation to be steadfast and confident in its greatness.\n\nCorrection: Macron did nothing of the kind. Instead, far away at the Nato summit in Washington, he sent a desperate letter to local newspapers promising that something will turn up. Eventually.\n\nThis letter to the electorate is the most tone-deaf declaration so far from a president who has led France into a political swamp. It's the equivalent of Winston Churchill announcing in the Hastings Chronicle that Britain will fight on the beaches - with buckets and spades.\n\n'No one won' the election, claimed Macron disingenuously. Although in truth the left did win, and he lost.\n\nThe President 'is in a denial of reality', declared Manon Aubry, a M\u00e9lenchoniste MEP, if he imagines 'building a solid majority'.\n\nCNEWS - the dissident news channel owned by Vincent Bollor\u00e9 that the government media regulator Arcom is threatening to drive off the airwaves for declining to toe the line - was contemptuous:\n\n'The Head of State, mute since the second round, said that \"no one won\" and called for \"a wide gathering\" of \"republican forces\", asking the French to \"leave them a little time\". Thus, \"the current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities.\"\n\nM\u00e9lenchon last night declared:\n\n'Unique in the democratic world: the president refuses to recognise the result of the ballot that placed the New Popular Front at the top of the votes and seats in the Assembly. This is the return of the royal right of veto on universal suffrage. He claims to give time to form another coalition by trickery after the elections! This is the return of the intrigues of the Fourth Republic. That's enough. He must bow and call the New Popular Front. It's simply democracy.'\n\nMarine Le Pen, wallowing in the humiliation of her enemy, said: 'If I understand correctly, in his letter, Emmanuel Macron proposes to block the New Popular Front that he himself helped to get elected three days ago. This circus is becoming disgraceful.'\n\nInternational pundits (including many in London, Berlin and Brussels) on Monday were cheerfully declaring that Macron had won his bet by calling elections in which, in alliance with the left, he pushed Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National to the sidelines. Mort de rire (dying laughing) as they say here.\n\nWhat Macron is hoping for now remains enigmatic and implausible. The Elys\u00e9e is briefing that discussions will continue to cobble together a centrist government, excluding extremes, and this might take some time.\n\nMacron's carrots are cooked. As Andrew Neil has pointed out, the biggest group in the new Assembly is the Left Alliance (NFP) which has 182 seats. But that is made up of four distinct parties. M\u00e9lenchon's hard left have 74, the Socialists 59, the Greens 28, and the Communists nine. The next biggest group is Macron's centrists, with 168 seats. This is made up of four elements: Macron's party on 102, various Democratic centrists on 33, the Horizon party of former prime minister \u00c9douarde Philippe on 25 and eight other seats.\n\nThen there's the right-wing National Rally with 143 seats, made up of two groups. There's also the centre-right Republicans, with 46 seats and a hodgepodge of smaller parties with 39 seats between them. The single largest party in the assembly is Marine's, which took 37 per cent of the popular vote. With a smaller share of the vote, the Labour party in the UK just seized complete control of parliament. Democracy works in mysterious ways.\n\nAt least 289 is needed in the Assembly for a majority. Macron has a potential pool of 168 - although even that is shaky as the leader of the right-wing faction of the Republicans said this morning that he wouldn't play ball. The ability to count is indispensable in politics but for Macron, supposedly the Mozart of finance, the sums don't add up.\n\nAll the perfumes on sale in the chichi boutiques of the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 cannot hide the stench of Macron's failure. His manoeuvrings have reduced his centre to ruins, embiggened the loony left, privileged the right with immunity for the shambles and created an Assembly dominated by furious leftists.\n\nHis cunning plan has let his enemy Marine Le Pen snatch a victory from defeat. She is now revelling in a catastrophe wrought by the president for which she bears zero responsibility, other than her insolence in having thrashed Macron in the European elections in early June and subsequently taking 37 per cent of the vote in the Assembly elections that followed.\n\nMacron continues to evade all responsibility for the disaster his dissolving the National Assembly caused. With his hissy fit he has destroyed his own credibility, threatened the credit of France, and invited ultra-leftist extremists to imagine they are entitled to form a government.\n\nEven the Macron-friendly Le Monde, quintessential organ of the bien-pensant Paris bubble, is struggling to hold its nerve.\n\n'Emmanuel Macron arrived behind the scenes at the Nato summit, without a word or a look for journalists. The tenant of the Elys\u00e9e thinks he has put more than an ocean between him and the political crisis that is shaking his country.'\n\nIf this is an accurate description of Macron's state of mind, his insouciance is chilling.\n\nWe will celebrate Bastille Day on Saturday and in my own commune will cheer the Tour de France as it whizzes by. The mayor will give prizes to the new baccalaureates. And a glass or two will be shared in the Place de la R\u00e9publique. A calm amidst the tempest. But even here in deepest France, people are on edge. A poll published this morning shows eight out of ten French people are anxious about the current political situation.\n\nThe Olympic Games open in Paris in 15 days, a juicy target should the frustrated left descend on the streets. The Games were supposed to be the ultimate global stage for Macron to strut. Now they're the stage for a summer of discontent.\n\nThe President's rash promise to swim in the Seine to prove it is safe for open-water swimming remains unfulfilled, because all the tests show the river remains hopelessly fouled with human faeces. If he does dare take to the still-contaminated waters, it will be a perfect metaphor for a presidency that has plunged into a sewer.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title":

Three days after the second round of France's snap parliamentary elections, which were narrowly won by the NFP, with 182 MPs, the pressure is mounting on the left-wing alliance. Meanwhile, figures on the right and some among President Emmanuel Macron's camp are working hard to keep the NFP out of government.\n\nOn Wednesday, Macron himself disputed the NFP's victory in a letter to the French people, stating \"no one has won.\" He suggested that the NFP was not in a position to govern and invited \"all the political forces\" who recognize their commitment to \"republican institutions,\" \"parliamentarianism,\" and who have a \"European orientation,\" to form \"a majority.\" The president clearly wants a coalition without La France Insoumise (LFI, radical left), which he has repeatedly described as outside of the \"republican arc\".\n\nThis has caused an uproar on the left: \"I've made the choice of the left rallying together and I won't budge from it,\" retorted Faure on France 2. The Socialist leader urged Macron to \"respect his duty as a republican, respect universal suffrage and respect the vote of the French.\"\n\nFurious, LFI leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon denounced \"the return of the royal right of veto over universal suffrage\" and \"the intrigues of the Fourth Republic.\" The day before, ex-LFI MP Adrien Quatennens called for \"a great people's march toward [the prime minister's office],\" drawing a barrage of criticism from his opponents, who, like Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, deemed his remarks to be \"factious.\"\n\nSince Sunday evening, France's left-wing parties - Socialists, LFI, Greens and Communists - have been holding a series of meetings, videoconferences and conclaves to agree on a potential prime minister, a government that has a place for each group and a way of operating. \"The idea is to arrive at a global arrangement: The party that has the prime minister doesn't have the other sovereign ministries,\" explained David Cormand, a Greens MEP who has been at the heart of the discussions.\n\nMoreover, he did not rule out the possibility of \"expanding to include people who want to break with Macronism.\" \"We want to move forward quickly, we need to thwart Macron's maneuvers, that will try to bypass the French people's vote,\" urged Christian Picquet, a member of the Communist party leadership who has also been involved in the talks. On the RMC radio station on Thursday morning, Greens MP Sandrine Rousseau regretted that a proposal was not already on the table. \"I think we're taking far too long. We're losing ground, and we're also causing concern in a way by not being capable of putting together a team and a government. So yes, we have our share of responsibility\" for the country's unstable situation, she warned.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [],

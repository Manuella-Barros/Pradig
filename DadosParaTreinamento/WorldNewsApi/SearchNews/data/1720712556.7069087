Kyiv\u2019s main military intelligence service shared satellite photos it said showed the aftermath of the attack. If confirmed, it would mark Ukraine\u2019s first known successful strike on a Su-57 fighter plane, a twin-engine stealth fighter lauded as Moscow\u2019s most advanced military aircraft. In one photo, black soot marks and small craters can be seen dotting a concrete strip around the parked aircraft. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense, the strike took place on Saturday at the Akhtubinsk base in southern Russia, some 589 kilometers (366 miles) from the front line. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what weapons were used, but the airfield\u2019s distance from Ukraine suggests that it was likely hit by drones. The strike comes after the United States and Germany recently authorized Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv. Ukraine has already used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from President Biden that allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. The Ukrainian agency said that the plane, which is capable of carrying stealth missiles across hundreds of miles, was among \u201ca countable few\u201d of its type in Moscow\u2019s arsenal. According to reports by Russian agencies, Moscow\u2019s armed forces obtained \u201cmore than 10\u201d new Su-57s last year, while 76 are set to be produced by 2028. Moscow did not immediately comment on the reports. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces downed three Ukrainian drones in the Astrakhan region, home to the Akhtubinsk airstrip. Since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion more than two years ago, Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production and used the drones to strike deep inside Russia, including a gas terminal near St. Petersburg that lies over 620 miles north of the Ukrainian border. Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces kept up drone attacks on Russia\u2019s southern border regions, according to local Russian officials. Three drones hit Belgorod province late on Saturday, damaging a power line and blowing out windows but causing no casualties, said Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Another two drones and a Ukrainian-made missile were brought down over the region on Sunday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Across Ukraine\u2019s front-line provinces, Russian shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded at least nine others on Saturday and overnight, according to reports by regional officials. A man died and two women suffered wounds in the village of Khotimlya, east of Kharkiv, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Shelling also damaged the local school, a council building, a shop and private homes, Syniehubov said. Heavy battles continued in the area as Ukrainian troops try to beat back Russia\u2019s invading forces after a weekslong push by Moscow that sparked fears for Kharkiv, located just 12 miles from the Russian border, and a wave of civilian evacuations. Russia\u2019s coordinated new offensive has centered on the Kharkiv region, but seems to include testing Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk farther south, while also launching incursions in the northern Sumy and Chernihiv regions. The easing of restrictions on the use of Western weapons will help Ukraine protect Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities across the border. It is unclear what other impact it may have on the direction of the war, in what is proving to be a critical period. The move drew a furious response from Moscow, and warnings it could embroil NATO in a war with Russia. But Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, described it as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d \u201cWhat was happening up around Kharkiv \u2026 was a Russian offensive where they were moving from one side of the border directly to the other side of the border, and it simply didn\u2019t make sense not to allow the Ukrainians to fire across that border, to hit Russian guns and emplacements that were firing at (them),\u201d Sullivan said Sunday in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u00ab Previous Next", "summary": "The strike comes after the United States and Germany recently authorized Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/06/09/ukraine-says-it-struck-one-of-russias-most-advanced-warplanes/", "image": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Russia_Ukraine_85734_08a073-1717945912.jpg?w=1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:28:34", "author": "Susie Blann And Joanna Kozlowska,SUSIE BLANN and JOANNA KOZLOWSKA - Associated Press", "authors": ["Susie Blann And Joanna Kozlowska", "SUSIE BLANN and JOANNA KOZLOWSKA - Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.266}

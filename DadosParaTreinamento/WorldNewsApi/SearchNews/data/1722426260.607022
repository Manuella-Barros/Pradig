The Nail Lab Premium Fungal Nail Treatment promises to eliminate toenail fungus and odour and repair damaged and discoloured nails in 'one to three weeks'. The nail elixir moisturises cuticles and nails and is an Amazon's Choice product costing \u00a318.99. The treatment is made from natural ingredients and is formulated with strengthening ingredients that penetrate deeply to combat fungal infections at the source, ensuring effective and long-lasting results. Nail Lab recommends applying the toenail fungal treatment three times daily, advising you leave it on overnight for optimal absorption into the nail. Complete nail renewal may take three to six months depending on the severity of the fungal infection.

If you're not 100% satisfied with the results of the Nail Lab Premium Fungal Nail Treatment, you can get a refund. The nail treatment has an average rating of 4.8 out of five, with one shopper saying: \"I've been using the product for just over a week and can definitely see a difference. My nail has been problematic for nearly two years and it had split straight down the middle so I was desperate! The colour has improved dramatically and is no longer a vile orange/yellow\u2026 I'm not sure how far it will heal in regards to the split on the nail but it's early days and I'm confident it will continue to improve\u2026 I can certainly feel less conscious about wearing my sandals this summer!\" A second wrote: \"I've been using this for over a month. Love the fact that, unlike others, this one does not smell unpleasant and more importantly does not stain clothing, nor the bedsheets when applying at night time. It appears to have really lightened my discoloured toenail and generally improved the appearance to a great extent. My toenail no longer feels brittle and is improving further with continued use. Price and value is great and I will keep using it.\" One reviewer, however, found it hard to follow the recommended application guidance. They still gave the product five stars and explained: \"I would definitely recommend this product, as it has worked wonders for me. Yes, it is difficult to apply this three times per day, but if you are patient and only apply it once per day, you will see results - it will just take longer. There are no 'quick fixes' for fungal toenail, but this has worked where others have failed. Well worth the money.\" You can buy the Nail Lab Premium Fungal Nail Treatment from Amazon for \u00a318.99.

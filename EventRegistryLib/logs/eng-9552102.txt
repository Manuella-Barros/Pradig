The Douglas County News-Press was in the process of investigating similar tips as that story came out. The academy generally requires a military ID, passport or driver's license to enter. For non-U.S. citizens, it requires special clearance and documentation to enter the base.\n\nWhile Colorado allows undocumented people to get a driver's license, it is \"not valid for federal identification, voting or public benefit purposes\" and the academy confirmed to CPR News that it's not a valid credential to enter the base.\n\nPeople with prior felonies, a criminal record, are also not allowed on the base.\n\nIn a statement from Douglas County High School Principal Anthony Kappas, the district said it worked closely with students and families to navigate the security requirements, but is changing the location out of concern that the ceremony would be disrupted.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there has been increased scrutiny by some in the community, as well as members of the media, regarding the location of our graduation ceremony,\" Kappas said in an email to the school.\n\nThe district said it had chosen to host the graduation at the Air Force Academy originally because of a past history with inclement weather ruining or delaying the ceremony. Kappas said the new location will also alleviate traffic concerns.\n\n\"There are concerns that this spotlight on our graduation could result in additional stress and traffic delays that we do not want for our seniors on their special day,\" he said. \"We want to ensure all family members, friends and loved ones are able to attend this milestone celebration and can arrive on time.\"\n\nThe ceremony will also be live streamed on the DCSD YouTube channel.\n\nA Douglas County High School student estimated that two dozen students and around 80 family members were impacted by the decision to have graduation at the academy, according to CPR News.\n\nDistrict 20 in Colorado Springs has hosted graduations at the Air Force Academy previously and has one scheduled there this year. It's unclear how that district helps students navigate the security requirements.\n\nKappas encouraged students to not let the last minute change influence their celebration.\n\n\"To the Class of 2024, do not let this take away from your big day,\" he said, \"Change is part of life and you are resilient. This will be an incredible day where we celebrate you and all of your hard work.

(KDVR) -- Douglas County School District is facing backlash from some parents after a change in location for Douglas County High School's May 22 commencement ceremony.\n\nThe decision to host the graduation ceremony at the U.S. Air Force Academy excited some students, but the security clearances needed to enter the base meant some graduating seniors or their families would not be able to attend the event.\n\nVoters to decide on Colorado's 2006 ban on same-sex marriage\n\nDouglas County High School's graduation location was announced proudly to parents in an email that read, in part: \"We hope you are as excited as we are about this amazing opportunity to celebrate our deserving seniors.\" The location: the U.S. Air Force Academy's Clune Arena.\n\nThey touted the venue's climate controls, as weather conditions have been an issue for school graduations in the past.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, parents received an email about a location change from the academy to EchoPark Stadium in Parker, a 40-minute drive. Parents of graduating seniors, like Meredith Newton, were upset with the last-minute decision just two weeks before the commencement ceremonies.\n\n\"It's super frustrating. It's disappointing. The kids, the parents, we were all excited about being at the Air Force Academy. A really nice venue, we don't have to worry about weather. I know Douglas County has had to delay a lot of their graduations because of weather, wind, snow,\" Meredith Newton said.\n\nHer son, Cobi Newton, is just as frustrated.\n\n\"I was really excited to have it at the Air Force. You don't really have that opportunity. Felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" he said.\n\nThe school noted multiple reasons for the change. Mainly, they claim there was a backlash from their community about the security requirements at the academy. According to the academy's website, entering the base requires a military ID, passport or driver's license. For non-U.S. citizens, additional clearance could take up to 72 hours. Anyone with a prior felony is not allowed on base.\n\nThose requirements were laid out in a mandatory meeting for parents two weeks ago, which Meredith Newton attended.\n\n\"They had an officer from the Air Force come down and explain the process to get in. It's not because they can't do it, it's because they don't want to do it, so we are accommodating the rest of the 400 students and thousands of family members and parents who will attend to fit the uncomfortable needs of 25 individuals. It's just a little frustrating,\" she said.\n\nFOX31 asked for a response from the school district but received the same letter that was sent to parents:\n\n\"It's still special, but then again going to this random track park stadium, it just doesn't compare. It's not on the same level,\" said Cobi Newton, who is not alone in his frustrations.\n\nA petition is circulating among students begging their school not to host commencement at EchoPark Stadium. The petition says: \"Not only is it a minimal amount of the class, but the graduation is on the 22nd, so changing the venue now is catastrophic to most. We need to act now since graduation is so soon, and we want location security so we no longer have to stress about our families.\"\n\nFOX31 Newsletters: Sign up to get breaking news sent to your inbox\n\n\"We're disappointed that it's at EchoPark in general. I think that they had ample time from November to now if this was going to be an issue for some to change the venue a long time ago. It's not a new process that the Air Force Academy is going through. This has been the standard, so why wait until the last minute?\" Meredith Newton said.\n\nFOX31 also reached out to the Air Force Academy, which declined to comment on the decision but shared the entry requirements.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Academy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadet_Field_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cadet Field House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County_School_District_RE-1", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County School District RE-1"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Castle Rock, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Castle Rock, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/kdvr_denver_articles_499/4f796c6653d08d09592cd4b93c338f80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552102", "eventUri": "eng-9552102", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Castle Rock, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 157, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I know Douglas County has had to delay a lot of their graduations because of weather, wind, snow,\" Meredith Newton said.\n\nHer son, Cobi Newton, is just as frustrated.\n\n\"I was really excited to have it at the Air Force. You don't really have that opportunity. Felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" he said.\n\nThe school noted multiple reasons for the change. Mainly, they claim there was a backlash from their community about the security requirements at the academy. According to the academy's website, entering the base requires a military ID, passport or driver's license. For non-U.S. citizens, additional clearance could take up to 72 hours. Anyone with a prior felony is not allowed on base.\n\nThose requirements were laid out in a mandatory meeting for parents two weeks ago, which Meredith Newton attended.\n\n\"They had an officer from the Air Force come down and explain the process to get in. It's not because they can't do it, it's because they don't want to do it, so we are accommodating the rest of the 400 students and thousands of family members and parents who will attend to fit the uncomfortable needs of 25 individuals. It's just a little frustrating,\" she said.\n\nDouglas County High School: 'Unfortunately, there has been increased scrutiny by some in our community'\n\nFOX31 asked for a response from the school district but received the same letter that was sent to parents:\n\n\"We worked closely with our students and families, as well as representatives from the Air Force Academy, to ensure our community understood the security requirements at the Academy and that everyone who wished to attend the commencement ceremony would be able to do so. Unfortunately, there has been increased scrutiny by some in our community, as well as members of the media, regarding the location of our graduation ceremony.\n\nThere are concerns that this spotlight on our graduation could result in additional stress and traffic delays that we do not want for our seniors and their families on this special day. We want to ensure all family members, friends and loved ones are able to attend this milestone celebration and can arrive on time.\"\n\n\"It's still special, but then again going to this random track park stadium, it just doesn't compare. It's not on the same level,\" said Cobi Newton, who is not alone in his frustrations.\n\nA petition is circulating among students begging their school not to host commencement at EchoPark Stadium. The petition says: \"Not only is it a minimal amount of the class, but the graduation is on the 22nd, so changing the venue now is catastrophic to most. We need to act now since graduation is so soon, and we want location security so we no longer have to stress about our families.\"\n\n\"We're disappointed that it's at EchoPark in general. I think that they had ample time from November to now if this was going to be an issue for some to change the venue a long time ago. It's not a new process that the Air Force Academy is going through. This has been the standard, so why wait until the last minute?\" Meredith Newton said.\n\nFOX31 also reached out to the Air Force Academy, which declined to comment on the decision but shared the entry requirements.", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabby_easterwood@kdvr.com", "name": "Gabby Easterwood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County_High_School_(Colorado)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County High School (Colorado)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Academy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadet_Field_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cadet Field House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KDVR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Child_and_Adolescent", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Child and Adolescent", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Schools", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Schools", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/05/Screen-Shot-2024-05-08-at-8.59.21-PM.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552102", "eventUri": "eng-9552102", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 157, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

These requirements include either a driver's license, military ID, passport or special clearance for non-U.S. citizens by the academy's Pass and registration office.\n\nUnder these guidelines, multiple families and educators at the school would that undocumented seniors and their families would be denied access to the academy's grounds and unable to attend the ceremony.\n\nGov.

Academy School District 20 has historically used the venue for the majority of its high schools with Village, Pine Creek, Rampart, Air Academy, Liberty, Discovery Canyon and Aspen Valley all scheduled to host their ceremonies there May 14-16.\n\n2024 graduation schedule around Colorado Springs: High schools and colleges\n\nDouglas County High School's Commencement Ceremony is on May 22, 3:00 p.m. at Echo Park Stadium. The ceremony will also be live streamed on the Douglas County School District's YouTube channel.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

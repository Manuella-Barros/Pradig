{"id": 232089132, "title": "Group Tackles Obi On Comparisons Between Nigerian, South African Elections", "text": "The Northern Awareness Network (NAN), has described as absurd and comical the recent comparison made by the Labour Party\u2019s Presidential candidate in Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections, Mr.Peter Obi, between the electoral processes of Nigeria and South Africa. A statement on Sunday issued by the Chairman of NAN, Salihu Suleiman, emphasised that the two nations have vastly different political histories and contexts, making any such comparisons by Peter Obi unreasonable and misleading. Suleiman said: \u201cSouth Africa has a long history of democracy, having gone through significant political reform and transformation over several decades of practice. \u201cOn the other hand, Nigeria only transitioned to democracy in 1999 after years of military rule.\u201d He argued that Peter Obi\u2019s attempt to juxtapose the electoral experiences of these two countries demonstrates a lack of understanding of their respective political landscapes. \u201cIt is clear that Peter Obi\u2019s attempt to compare the electoral processes of South Africa and Nigeria is quite ridiculous. \u201cThe two countries are at different stages of democratic development, and it would be more prudent to focus on addressing the specific challenges facing the Nigerian electoral system rather than drawing unwarranted comparisons,\u201d he explained. He pointed out that the Nigerian electoral system is still in its infancy and that comparing it to South Africa\u2019s more mature democracy is not only inaccurate but also unfair to the people of Nigeria, who have been working diligently to build a functioning democracy. Despite the challenges confronted by Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), NAN commended the Commission for its commendable strides in ensuring the conduct of credible, free, and fair elections. \u201cOver the past 27 years, Nigeria has enjoyed uninterrupted democracy and peaceful transitions, a testament to INEC\u2019s commitment to upholding democratic principles. \u201cINEC has taken proactive measures to address these challenges by implementing various reforms and adopting new technologies to ensure transparency and accountability in the electoral process,\u201d Suleiman noted. He highlighted Nigeria\u2019s vast geographical expanse and extensive population as significant challenges to conducting elections smoothly, yet acknowledged INEC\u2019s innovations in logistical planning and collaborations with key stakeholders to meet these challenges effectively. Further illustrating INEC\u2019s progress, NAN pointed to the enhancement of voter education and public awareness campaigns, which have increased civic participation and informed voters about their rights and responsibilities. Using social media, radio, and television, INEC has managed to reach millions of Nigerians, providing comprehensive electoral education. In an admonition to Peter Obi, NAN detailed South Africa\u2019s historical and recent electoral irregularities, underscoring that the country has faced its own significant electoral challenges. \u201cDuring the apartheid era, elections were manipulated to disenfranchise the majority of the population. \u201cPost-apartheid, South Africa has still encountered issues such as voter fraud, ballot tampering, voter intimidation, and questionable campaign financing. \u201cIn recent years, there have been concerns about the influence of money in politics, with allegations of illicit campaign financing and corruption. The 2019 elections were marred by reports of double voting and discrepancies in the voter registration process,\u201d NAN said. Suleiman called on Nigerian politicians, including Peter Obi, to acknowledge the unique challenges facing Nigeria\u2019s electoral system and work towards addressing them instead of making false equivalences with countries that have a more entrenched democratic tradition. He called for a focus on constructive measures to improve Nigeria\u2019s electoral system and encouraged political leaders to acknowledge and address these challenges head-on rather than resorting to impractical comparisons.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0057.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0057.jpg 750w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0057-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></div>The Northern Awareness Network (NAN), has described as absurd and comical the recent comparison made by the Labour Party&#8217;s Presidential candidate in Nigeria&#8217;s 2023 elections, Mr.Peter Obi, between the electoral processes of Nigeria and South Africa.

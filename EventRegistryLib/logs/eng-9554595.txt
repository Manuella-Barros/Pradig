The US film-maker has championed the duo's work for at least 50 years.\n\nBefore launching into a film-by-film analysis of their output, Scorsese's narration fills in some biographical details: Kent-born Powell getting his start as a gofer at a film studio in Nice, and Jewish-Hungarian screenwriter Pressburger's flight to Britain from Nazi Germany. The pair first collaborated on the 1939 thriller \"The Spy in Black\", before 1941's \"taut\" anti-Nazi war drama \"49th Parallel\" became a hit, making their name as a team and winning Pressburger a writing Oscar, said Variety.\n\nThe duo's \"golden age\" spanned \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\", a \"romantic anti-war epic said to have rubbed Winston Churchill the wrong way\"; the \"heart-clutching afterlife fantasy 'A Matter of Life and Death'; the sensualist convent psychodrama 'Black Narcissus'; and the luminous, fairytale-riffing ballet tragedy 'The Red Shoes'\".\n\nThe British establishment \"shamed itself\" by turning its back on \"these homegrown masters\".\n\n\"Notoriously,\" said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian, \"Powell had become an un-person in British cinema during the 60s, unable to work after critics and distributors had an immoral panic about 'Peeping Tom', the satirical horror masterpiece that Powell had directed on his own.\"\n\nBut \"now the Powell/Pressburger films almost cannot be seen except through the medium of Scorsese's glorious evangelism; their movies and his have virtually become intertextual events\", said Bradshaw.\n\nAs the film progresses, Scorsese plays clips of his films, including \"Raging Bull\" and \"The Age of Innocence\", showing how he was influenced by the pair. \"How remarkable\", said Bradshaw, that a director who emerged in the era when gritty realism \"supplanted the romantic idealism of Powell and Pressburger\" was to give their work a second lease of life.\n\nDirector David Hinton \"paints a sweeping portrait of a unique collaboration\" that elevated their talents \"into something close to magic\", said Time Out.\n\n\"Made in England\" makes \"good use of its star narrator\", who had a friendship with Powell, and draws parallels between the \"forbidden love story in 'Colonel Blimp' and 'The Age of Innocence', the violent dance of 'The Red Shoes' and 'Raging Bull', and the menacing, lurking presence of Lermontov to that of Travis Bickle in 'Taxi Driver'\".\n\nAll in all, it serves as a \"grand introduction to some of their unforgettable images\". And even a \"10-second clip of 'Black Narcissus' or 'The Red Shoes' holds more punch than most other films\".", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nFor the past three decades, few have been more dedicated to preserving the legacy of British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger than Thelma Schoonmaker and Martin Scorsese. Schoonmaker, one of cinema's most renowned editors, and Scorsese, for many the world's greatest living director, have made it their business to ensure audiences remember the men behind such indelible movies as The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus and A Matter of Life and Death.\n\nThe pair - Powell died in 1990 at the age of 84, Pressburger in 1988 at the age of 85 - were cinematic fabulists, responsible for visually rich Technicolor fantasias, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Schoonmaker and Scorsese have been a similar dream-team ever since their first collaboration on the 1980 boxing saga Raging Bull, for which Schoonmaker won an Oscar - her first of three, followed by wins for editing The Aviator (2004) and The Departed (2006). It was in the immediate aftermath of Raging Bull that Scorsese introduced Schoonmaker to Powell, who he'd befriended in the 1970s, after the British director had split from his Hungarian-born producer/screenwriter, Pressburger. They'd enjoyed success in the Forties and Fifties, but by the time Schoonmaker became a fan of their work, their names had fallen into obscurity.\n\n\"Nobody knew who they were anymore in England,\" says the white-haired Schoonmaker, 84, when we meet in a Berlin hotel. \"Marty got an award at the Edinburgh Film Festival for [his 1974 film] Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. And they said, 'Who do you want to give you the award?' He said, 'Michael Powell', and they said, 'Who is that?' They had no idea!\" But Powell was located, and he and Scorsese struck up a bond. \"The blood started to run in my veins again,\" Powell wrote in his autobiography.\n\nBy 1984, Schoonmaker was married to Powell, who was 35 years her senior, while her own career as Scorsese's go-to editor was flourishing. \"I'm very lucky,\" she reflects. \"It's the greatest job in the world. And [Scorsese] gave me the greatest husband in the world! So I've had it all.\" Ever since Powell's death in 1990, Schoonmaker and Scorsese have proudly overseen the restoration of his and Pressburger's films. It is work that's on-going: early June sees the re-release of one of their lesser-known titles, The Small Back Room, a 1949 British noir starring David Farrar.\n\nThis appreciation of their canon looks set to continue with Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger, an exhaustive documentary that sees Scorsese on camera guiding audiences through their entire career. Directing it is David Hinton, who first met Powell in the 1980s during filming of a South Bank Show special on the director. Sitting next to Schoonmaker, Hinton recalls Powell being \"full of energy\" when they first met, thanks to Scorsese's friendship. \"Since then, the Powell and Pressburger reputation has just gone from strength to strength. In a way, they keep being rediscovered again and again.\"\n\nLast autumn, the British Film Institute staged a two-month long season, \"Cinema Unbound: The Creative Worlds of Powell and Pressburger\". \"Every screening was packed with very young people,\" adds Hinton. \"I think there's still new generations who are discovering the films.\" But it will undoubtedly be Made in England that further cements Powell and Pressburger's reputation. Schoonmaker calls their work \"very pure... very emotional, particularly for a British film at that time\".\n\nMade in England is also a treat for Scorsese fans. The director is well-known for his cine-literate documentaries, like 1999's My Voyage to Italy, in which he explored the movies - by the likes of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio de Sica and Federico Fellini - that influenced his youth. Likewise, he discovered Powell and Pressburger as a young man, and talks passionately in Made in England about how their unique, flavoursome work influenced his own films - he even directly lifted shots from their work for Raging Bull and his 1993 Edith Wharton adaptation The Age of Innocence.\n\n\"These films were not like the ones he'd been seeing from Hollywood,\" says Schoonmaker. \"They didn't have real villains and real heroes. They were more about people. More like us. And [Scorsese] liked that very much, because that was in his instincts. I think he was born to be a film director. He came out of the womb that way. And so he was instantly drawn to these movies.\" Whenever he saw the logo for their production company, The Archers, depicting an arrow hitting its target, \"he knew it was going to be something unusual\".\n\nAs fascinating and informative as it is to hear Scorsese wax lyrical about their films, the real meat comes as we learn about his friendship with Powell. There is some touching footage of the British filmmaker on the set of Scorsese's The King of Comedy, his masterly 1982 tale with Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis. Powell's previous film - which would turn out to be his last - had been a decade before, 1972's The Boy Who Turned Yellow. \"He went through a very hard 20 years of total oblivion, unable to make a movie but writing and writing and writing wonderful ideas,\" says Schoonmaker.\n\nSeveral times, Scorsese tried to help Powell get projects underway. \"Michael was very impatient with people. He would just insult them,\" chuckles Schoonmaker. \"But Marty, growing up in a mafia neighbourhood and working in his early days in Hollywood, learned how to deal with people of power and how to raise money from them, even though they disagreed with what he was going to do. He had that technique. But Michael didn't need it. Because in the war years, they were just making masterpiece after masterpiece.\"\n\nFilms like wartime sagas The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and A Canterbury Tale were warmly embraced but, as Schoonmaker points out, it was during the production of 1948's The Red Shoes that \"trouble started\". Set in the world of professional ballet, and starring Moira Shearer as an aspiring dancer, the film was a profitable, Oscar-nominated success and remains heralded for its timeless, magical qualities. Yet its backers, the Rank Organisation, \"didn't understand it\", putting a huge strain on the company's relationship with Powell and Pressburger, ultimately leading to a parting of the ways.\n\nSubsequently, the success of their films dwindled and The Archers fizzled out, although Powell was not done. Separate from Pressburger he created one of his most notorious films, Peeping Tom (1960), a highly disturbing psychodrama about voyeurism. It was, however, critically reviled upon release. Was it Powell's biggest heartbreak? \"The thing about Michael is that he always believed that what he was doing was right,\" Schoonmaker muses. \"And so even as painful as it was, as destructive as it was... he never gave up knowing he was right. But it was hard.\"\n\nBorn in Algiers, Schoonmaker didn't encounter Powell's work until her teens. Her father Bertram worked for the Standard Oil Company, and her early years were spent on the Caribbean island of Aruba. She didn't really see television until her family moved back to the States in her mid-teens. \"One of the first films I saw was The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,\" she remembers. \"And it just was seared into my mind for some reason.\" She speaks fondly of the moment Roger Livesey's Lieutenant Candy realises he has feelings for Deborah Kerr's Edith. \"I just think it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.\"\n\nBy the time Peeping Tom was released, Schoonmaker was at Cornell University studying Russian and political science. She began to pass State Department tests to find a position in the US government, until she was questioned \"very strongly\" about apartheid by representatives from the FBI, CIA and the State Department. They asked her what she would say about the system if she were in South Africa. \"And I said, 'Well, it has to end. It's terrible.' And they said, 'Well, you can't do that, as a diplomat, until your country decides to do that'.\"\n\nLooking for another vocation, Schoonmaker secured a job as a trainee assistant editor, and later met the young Scorsese, famously joining him on the editorial team of Michael Wadleigh's 1970 music documentary Woodstock (for which she was nominated for her first Oscar). They stayed in touch through the Seventies, but it wasn't until Raging Bull that they officially worked together again. The film cast De Niro as real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, and it was Schoonmaker's baptism by fire. \"I learned so much on Raging Bull,\" she says. \"I mean, [Scorsese] was teaching me.\"\n\nDid they ever have disagreements? \"We have never really disagreed firmly, I don't think, and the most important time was at the end of Raging Bull where De Niro is facing himself in the mirror. And they did 15 takes, which is highly unusual. They were talking back and forth between each other with each one, 'Should we go that way? Should we go this way?' I liked the warmer takes. Scorsese said, 'No, he has to be cold.' And so we screened with our friends two ways. And Marty was right!\"\n\nRarely working for other directors, Schoonmaker has remained loyally by Scorsese's side, right up to last year's Killers of the Flower Moon, which earned her a ninth Oscar nomination. \"It's lovely to be working with him, because he's always changing, and never repeats himself,\" she says. \"And we share this great love of Powell and Pressburger, which is something we talk about all the time.\" And now, with Made in England, The Archers will be hitting the bullseye once again.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

Yet for years they were -- which is why it is always salutary to have a documentary like Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger remind us of their genius.\n\nDavid Hinton's film offers a reasonably comprehensive history of the two men, English and Hungarian-born respectively, who created some of cinema's most enduring and eccentric visions of British identity in films such as A Matter of Life and Death, I Know Where I'm Going! and A Canterbury Tale. Some of their best were made for wartime propaganda purposes, but the duo fulfilled their brief with mischievous brilliance, not always to the delight of the authorities. Later, beloved dance fantasy The Red Shoes and Himalayas melodrama Black Narcissus pushed different genres into a visionary dimension.\n\nThe film is narrated to camera by Martin Scorsese, who fell in love with the duo's films, having discovered them as a child. Powell would become Scorsese's friend and mentor, years after the wilderness period that followed the Englishman's career-wrecking 1960 chiller (and, subsequently, acknowledged masterpiece) Peeping Tom.\n\nWith ample archive footage and extracts from the oeuvre, Scorsese offers his own account -- enthused, but by no means hagiographic -- of a team he describes as \"experimental filmmakers working within the system\" (they happily saw themselves as \"amateurs in a world of professionals\").\n\nArguably, there's a little too much Scorsese: his detailed explanations of the pair's influence on his own work can be distracting. Still, this is a brisk, insightful guide to the masters from a superfan who knows their films inside out, has copied them avidly and doesn't mind admitting it.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_and_Pressburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Powell and Pressburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_England_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Made in England (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Narcissus_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Narcissus (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Matter_of_Life_and_Death_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Matter of Life and Death (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(fairy_tale)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Red Shoes (fairy tale)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melodrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eccentricity (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Scorsese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canterbury"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canterbury"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Godiva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Godiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hagiography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fef58e818-f8c6-4549-88a2-fbd46417c3ea.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554595", "eventUri": "eng-9554595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

British bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones invaded the airwaves, and clothing for both men and women became much more playful and experimental. The decade welcomed change and progression, with hippies spreading their peaceful doctrine in America and students protesting in France. The civil rights movement and second-wave feminism gained steam; people were simply fed up with the traditionalism that defined their parent's generation - things had to be done differently.\n\nThis ethos extended into cinema. As attitudes became less rigid, on-screen censorship eased, with the Hays Code eventually getting scrapped in 1968. From then on, it seemed as though filmmakers dealt in a currency of taboo topics and spoke a purely experimental language, taking influence from European and avant-garde cinema. One of the key filmmakers to emerge from this period was Martin Scorsese, who still maintains the crown as one of cinema's most fluent craftsmen.\n\nHe released his first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door, in 1967. Yet, it was movies like Mean Streets and Taxi Driver which helped Scorsese establish himself as an incredible talent. Since then, he's directed more acclaimed movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas, most recently releasing Killers of the Flower Moon in 2023.\n\nFor years, Scorsese has always cited a certain filmmaking duo as the reason for his love of the medium - Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The pair started directing movies in the '30s, with their first collaboration coming in 1939 with The Spy in Black. Some of their most iconic productions were The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes, and A Matter of Life and Death.\n\nScorsese was captivated from the moment he first saw one of their films, which was The Thief of Baghdad when he was just a few years old. The duo's use of colour was mesmerising, bringing a sense of otherworldliness to each film, no matter the genre. The Taxi Driver director frequently found himself getting lost in each film, citing The Red Shoes as his favourite.\n\nHe once told Criterion, \"I've said and written so much about this picture over the years; for me, it's always been one of the very greatest ever made,\" continuing, \"Every time I go back to look at it -- about once a year -- it's new: it reveals another side, another level, and it goes deeper.\"\n\nHe also loves Black Narcissus, based on Rumer Godden's novel of the same name, which follows a group of women in a convent as they are enticed by sexual desire. He told Sight and Sound, in reference to the 1947 film, \"When I saw their work on screen, it was like being bathed in colour, it was palpable.\"\n\nThe pair have had such a significant influence on Scorsese that they even became friends, with Powell eventually marrying Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. Scorsese borrowed many elements of the duo's style for his own movies, such as close-ups and the use of bright colours. When Powell watched Mean Streets, his one complaint, according to Scorsese, was that he used \"too much red.\" The filmmaker humorously remarked, \"'Too much red?' It's all over his films, and that's where I'd got it from!\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A Matter of Life and Death, for example, was made in a bid to improve Anglo-US relations, but is an extraordinary piece of cinema.\n\nScorsese recounts the rise and subsequent fall from grace of both Powell and Pressburger. Scorsese and Powell became very close friends in later years.\n\nThis is a must-see for cineastes and cinephiles alike and finally gives Powell and Pressburger the recognition they deserve.\n\nTHIS powerful and heartbreaking drama set in 2018 as Guatemala confronts the country's violent past and is immersed in the trial of the military officers responsible for starting the civil war and the genocide of indigenous people.\n\nWritten and directed by Cesar Diaz, the film is seen through the eyes of Ernesto (Armando Espitia), a young anthropologist who, on hearing the account from an old Indian woman about a mass grave which she believes is where the remains of her missing husband are, thinks he has found a lead to the whereabouts of his disappeared father, a guerilla fighter during the conflict.\n\nAs the layers of this complex film are slowly peeled away, the truth becomes too horrifying to comprehend and Ernesto does not get the closure he expected.\n\nIT is hard to imagine how or why to follow the impressive Planet of the Apes trilogy starring Andy Serkis, but by setting this new instalment several hundred years after Caesar's (Serkis) reign, exploring his legacy and introducing new characters, the film-makers have injected some fresh life into the franchise.\n\nShot in New South Wales, Australia, it is visually arresting with its stunning landscapes and staggering CGI effects which bring to life a beautiful yet terrifyingly dystopian world in which apes are the dominant species while humans are living a feral existence unable to speak due to a virus which has decimated humanity.\n\nA tyrannical ape leader Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand), who has misappropriated Caesar's teachings, is building his own empire by enslaving other clans.\n\nMeanwhile a naive young primate (Owen Teague, It) teams up with a mysterious young woman (Freya Allan, The Witcher) with her own agenda, and a learned orangutan (Peter Macon, The Orville) who knows their real history, to hunt down Proximus, to avenge his father's death and free his Eagle clan.\n\nIt isn't until the final act that this simian sci-fi finally comes alive, posing more questions than it answers. Sadly, being the first of another trilogy, it is a case of \"to be continued.\"\n\nAN archaeologist and an architect are united in their grief at slowly losing their partners to a traumatic brain injury in a film that does no real justice to the importance of this subject matter.\n\nRebel Wilson, in her first dramatic role, and Charlotte Gainsbourg deliver solid performances but their characters' blossoming relationship as their other halves begin to forget them due to their condition isn't very convincing.\n\nCowritten and directed by Celyn Jones (who also plays Wilson's husband in the film) and Tom Stern, the drama explores the emotional impact on loved ones of having to deal with someone whom they are losing day by day while there is nothing they can do.", "source": {"uri":

"body": "IN the Hollywood jungle, few great films have been quite as ruthlessly exploit\u00aded as Charlton \u00adHeston's Planet Of The Apes.\n\nSince that 1968 classic, variations on the title have included Beneath The, Escape From The, Conquest Of The, Battle For The, Rise Of The, Dawn Of The and War For The.\n\nDuring that time the main evolution has been in special effects rather than plot.\n\nThe origins story which started in 2011 with the brilliant James Franco-led Rise was a major step forward in computer-generated imagery, where the apes felt 100 per cent believable at all times.\n\nThat remains the main selling point in Kingdom Of, where it is impossible not to be impressed by how lifelike these simulated simians are.\n\nYou really feel like you can see into the souls of these digitally designed apes.\n\nAs for the story, though, it largely remains the same -- apes and humans have to find a way to coexist.\n\nIt is about as likely as the Royal Family getting along.\n\nIn this latest instalment, ape leader Caesar has passed away and several generations later his decree that ape shall not kill ape has been forgotten.\n\nWe are now into the era of gorilla warfare, sorry!, as primate-kind's strongest are determined to make other species bend to their will.\n\nThe main character is young chimp Noa, whose peaceful village is raided by the more advanced gorillas.\n\nHe must free his friends and, during that quest, is befriended by zen-like orangutan Raka and human Mae, played by Brit Freya Allan.\n\nThere are amusing moments, such as the apes' astonishment that a dim human can talk.\n\nBut a lack of human inter\u00adaction could be the downfall of this movie empire.\n\nApart from Mae, the only other homo sapien that speaks is William H Macy's treacherous Trevethan, and he appears too briefly.\n\nWhat kept the previous trio of Planet films revolving so nicely were class actors such as Woody Harrelson, Gary Oldman and Brian Cox in human roles.\n\nFreya is impressive enough, but she is hampered by a lack of decent dialogue.\n\nIf future movies don't up the human input we could soon see one titled The End Of The Planet Of The Apes.\n\nWHEN I had the pleasure of meeting Martin Scorsese, he spent a fair chunk of the interview talking about the British-based film-makers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.\n\nThis documentary shows the depth of the American director's obsession.\n\nPowell and Pressburger created groundbreaking movies in the 1940s such as The Red Shoes, The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus and A Matter Of Life And Death.\n\nBut for many years they were largely forgotten in Britain, to the extent that Powell ended up barely able to pay his heating bills.\n\nNew Yorker Scorsese took his hero over to the US in the 1970s and put him back in the movie business.\n\nFor more than two hours in this documentary he analyses and speaks passionately about all aspects of Powell and Pressburger's work.\n\nFor film buffs this will be a joy, revealing almost as much about the famous director as it does about the men he is talking about.\n\nWhether it will be as entertaining for those unfamiliar with Powell and Pressburger is doubtful.\n\nBut, just like the film- making duo, Made In England deserves attention.\n\nIn the latter, he plays a British archaeologist gone rogue in 1980s Italy.\n\nAnd writer-director Alice Rohrwacher serves up a delightfully quaint story for O'Connor's Arthur to navigate.\n\nHe's aloof, often ill-tempered, but able to disarm with charm.\n\nOh, and he's gifted at finding ancient Etruscan tombs for his mates to steal and sell artefacts from.\n\nAs the story unfolds, he meets Italia (Carol Duarte), a live-in student/unpaid maid for singing teacher Flora (Isabella Rossellini).\n\nFlora is the mother of Arthur's awol lover and several other daughters keen to move her out of her dilapidated house into a nursing home.\n\nRohrwacher's witty script unveils the relationship tensions as characters struggle to let go of the past.\n\nHelene Louvart's gorgeous cinematography captures the sublime mundanity of this traditional Italian setting and the magical realism of Arthur's heightened, melancholic senses.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dulcie_pearce@thesun.co.uk",

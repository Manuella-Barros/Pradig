I have been satisfied with what they have done. I think the administration is, but we have many steps still to go.\"\n\nIn November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the United States and Canada.\n\nThe White House said last month it viewed the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in the assassination plots as a very serious matter.\n\nIt made the comment after the Washington Post reported that an officer in India's intelligence service was directly involved in the foiled plan in the U.S. and also involved in the separate shooting death of a Sikh activist last June in Canada.\n\nCanadian police on Friday arrested and charged three Indian men with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year and said they were probing whether the men had ties to the Indian government.\n\nIndia has expressed concern about the linkage to officials and dissociated itself from the plot, saying it would formally investigate the U.S. concerns, and take necessary follow-up action on the findings of a panel set up on Nov. 18.\n\nThe issue is a highly delicate one for both India and the U.S administration as they try to build closer ties in the face of shared concerns about China's growing power.\n\n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The former mayor's appointment was dogged by questions about whether he knew, or should have known, about a former top aide's alleged sexual harassment of colleagues.\n\nThe ambassadorship has given the close Biden ally the opportunity to relaunch his political career thousands of miles from the lingering scandal at L.A. City Hall.\n\nGarcetti was a frequent participant at the luminary-packed annual Beverly Hilton conference while he was mayor, but his focus this year was on India, rather than the City of Angels. He participated in an opening fireside chat Sunday and three panels Tuesday, two of which were livestreamed.\n\n\"It's such an incredible convening,\" Garcetti said of the Milken conference, praising its importance to the city and the heft of its attendees. \"I always found it to be such an amazing place to connect L.A. with the world and vice versa. And now I'm a part of that world, connecting with L.A. this time.\"\n\nDuring a Tuesday morning panel with several business leaders focused on investment in India, Garcetti described the country as \"a place where the dynamism of the economy, the youth and the optimism of the population, and the raw opportunities and energy is almost unmatched in the world.\"\n\nHe described himself as a \"bridge between the two largest democracies in the world\" and said part of his mission as ambassador was to help Americans get to know India as well as Indians know America, \"because India and Indians know America and Americans so much better because of decades of immigration, contributions [and] engagement.\"\n\nThe former mayor, who was a powerful booster for Los Angeles while in City Hall, at one point lapsed into a familiar riff about where to go to see the future, except this time, India -- and not Los Angeles -- was the destination in question.\n\nHis second panel on Tuesday, titled \"The U.S.-India Relationship: Possibilities and Perspectives from Investors and Indian Business Leaders,\" was closed to the public. He appeared on a third panel Tuesday afternoon about the future of statecraft and diplomacy alongside ambassadors to the U.S. from Panama and Australia and a State Department official.\n\nDuring the panel, Garcetti spoke about how he had studied international relations and always thought he would go into human rights, international development or diplomacy work, surprising people when he first ran for Los Angeles City Council in 2001.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles Garcetti visited his parents, former L.A. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and Sukey Garcetti, his sister and brother-in-law and his former foster kids, he said. His wife, Amy Wakeland, and young daughter remained in India because of her school schedule, he said.\n\nThe stop in the Los Angeles was part of a five-city trip that included a military event in Honolulu and a talk Monday at Stanford's Hoover Institution. Garcetti also met with Indian American tech leaders in Silicon Valley and Indian students at Stanford. He will also attend a series of White House and State Department meetings in Washington, where he will give a Council on Foreign Relations keynote address, followed by a stop in New York before departing for India on Saturday.\n\nGarcetti said that he and Mayor Karen Bass \"talk all the time.\" He spoke to The Times while driving his mother's Subaru down Wilshire Boulevard toward Getty House, the mayoral residence, to visit with his successor.\n\n\"It's funny, I'm driving myself to the house I used to live to meet the mayor,\" Garcetti said with a hearty laugh. He marveled at the progress on the D Line subway extension along Wilshire, on which he had broken ground as mayor.\n\nHis new job is \"extraordinary,\" he said, though he does miss taco trucks and bagels, both of which are hard to come by in India.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

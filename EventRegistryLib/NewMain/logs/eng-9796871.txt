We had to take a break, but I love the D.

The actor shares Tommy, 16, and Sammy, 18, with his wife of nearly two decades, Tanya Haden.\n\nWhile Black's kids are fans of the source material, Borderlands director Eli Roth assured viewers that they need not play the game to enjoy the movie.\n\n\"It's for people who love the game.

The singer/actor hinted that the comedy rock duo he fronts with longtime partner Kyle Gass will return at some point after announcing an open-ended break and cancelling dates on an Australian tour following Gass' controversial on-stage joke about last month's assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n\"We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime,\" Black told Variety at the red carpet premiere of the film Borderlands on Tuesday night (August 6). \"And we'll be back.\"\n\nBlack apologized and announced that the group would be taking a break after the pair were lambasted by Australia's right-wing following the ill-timed joke from Gass. During the band's show in Sydney on July 14, Black rolled out a birthday cake on stage for Gass and when asked to make a wish, Gass quipped, \"Don't miss Trump next time.\" The comment was in reference to the assassination attempt on Trump the day before in Butler, PA, where a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on a Trump rally, grazing the one-term former president's ear and killing a rally attendee.\n\nGass initially apologized in an Instagram post, saying, \"I don't condone violence of any kind\" and adding that he was \"incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement\"; the post has since been deleted. Gass was dropped by his agent and the remainder of the group's Australian tour -- as well as a planned fall run of shows in U.S. swing states in the lead-up to November's presidential election -- was cancelled. Black also posted an apology on Instagram, writing, \"I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.\"\n\nAt the time of the tour cancellation, Black's statement said that \"all future creative plans are on hold.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night, Black said he has spoken to Gass since the tour was called off. \"Yeah, we're friends. That hasn't changed. These things take time sometimes... And we'll be back when it feels right,\" he said with no indication of when the group might return to stage. Black also happened to have a bit of Tenacious D hardware with him on the carpet for the premiere of the action/sci-fi movie in which he plays a wisecracking robot named Claptrap alongside stars Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis and Cate Blanchett.\n\nPulling out the magic guitar pick from the D's 2006 big screen comedy, Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny, Black said, \"Look what I wore today: I wore the Pick of Destiny. I love Tenacious D. It's probably my favorite job, if you can call it that.

Tenacious D were performing at the ICC Theatre in Sydney in July when the incident occurred.\n\nThe concert coincided with Gass's 64th birthday, and in celebration, Black brought a cake out onto the stage with candles ablaze. When Gass blew out the candles, he made his wish out loud: \"Don't miss Trump next time\".\n\nThe quote made light of the recent assassination attempt on Trump, who is currently in the race for the presidential election on November 5th. At the time, he was running against President Joe Biden. However, due to health complications related to his advanced age, Biden has stepped back from the race, leaving the Democrats' position open for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nNaturally, Gass' comment caused a degree of controversy in Australia that soon spread to his home country of the US. During the concert, most attendees gave out a chuckle, but several Australian politicians subsequently called upon the Prime Minister to deport the pair of musicians.\n\nAustralian senator Ralph Babet released a statement saying, \"I call on the prime minister Anthony Albanese to join me in denouncing Tenacious D, Jack Black and band member Kyle Gass, and I call on the immigration minister Andrew Giles to revoke their visas and deport them immediately,\" adding, \"Anything less than a deportation is an endorsement of the shooting and the attempted assassination of Donald J Trump.\"\n\nTenacious D duly cancelled their remaining tour dates and departed Australia. Although Black laughed at the joke at the time, he subsequently made a solemn statement on social media. \"I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,\" he wrote. \"After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold,\" he said. \"I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.\"\n\nNow, almost a month on, Black has given an update regarding Tenacious D's precarious future. \"We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime. And we'll be back,\" Black told Variety at the Borderlands premiere on August 6th.\n\nIn his initial statement, Black revealed that he was \"blindsided by the statement that was said at the show,\" distancing himself from his bandmate's error of judgment. Asked whether he is still on good terms with Gass this week, Black responded, \"Yeah, we're friends. That hasn't changed. These things take time sometimes...

When asked by Black to make a wish, Gass joked, \"Don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nOne Trump rally attendee was killed in the shooting and two others were critically injured. The shooter was himself killed by the Secret Service and Trump was sent to a nearby hospital, then discharged hours later.\n\nGass's comment incited widespread controversy.

He joked, \"Don't miss Trump next time.\" Two days later, Black said that he was \"blindsided\" by the comment and that he did not condone hate speech or political violence. Cancelling the remainder of their 'Spicy Meatball' tour, he said that the duo's \"creative plans are on hold\".\n\nGass apologised on Instagram shortly after, calling his words \"highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake\", but deleted the apology later that week.\n\nWhen asked about the Tenacious D situation, Black told Variety yesterday (August 6), \"We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime. And we'll be back.\"\n\nHe also said that he's still friends with Gass, and that they've spoken since the controversy. \"Yeah, we're friends. That hasn't changed,\" he said. \"These things take time sometimes... And we'll be back when it feels right.\"\n\nAmong the people criticising Gass' remarks at the show last month was Australian federal senator Ralph Babet, who went as far as to call for the duo's deportation from the country.\n\nHe wrote in a statement, \"I condemn in the strongest possible way the call to political violence by Tenacious D in Sydney on Sunday. To advocate and or wish for the assassination of a President is egregious, disgusting, filthy, evil, and not acceptable in any way, shape or form. This was not a joke, he was deadly serious when he wished for the death of the President.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gass was also dropped by his agent, with Michael Greene of Greene & Associates Talent Agency no longer representing him.\n\nAt present, Black is promoting the movie Borderlands, a sci-fi action comedy, in which he voices Claptrap, a robot who features in the video game series the movie is based on.

Thanks to his love for music, the actor is also a stellar musician and singer who helped create the band Tenacious D. Forming during the 1990s, Black, with help from his friend Kyle Gass, showcased their love for rock and roll and heavy metal. The band's last album to his shelves was Post-Apocalypto, which released in November 2018. And recently, the band decided to take a break from the spotlight after Gass made some unsavory comments about former President Donald Trump.\n\nGiven that the 2024 presidential election is right around the corner, candidates like Trump and Kamala Harris have been touring the country, hoping to gain a few votes. But during a campaign rally, a gunman tried to assassinate the former President. Only grazing his ear, Trump continued to hold rallies. And last month, Black performed in Sydney and wanted to celebrate his friend's birthday with a special cake. Like any birthday, Black asked Gass to make a wish. The musician said, \"Don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nAlthough not a long statement, the few words garnered a great deal of backlash that led to Tenacious D taking some time off. But with Black a Hollywood star, he recently walked the red carpet for the premiere of his new film Borderlands. When asked about the comments and what the future holds, Black said, \"We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime. We'll be back.\"\n\n[RELATED: Australian Senator Wants Jack Black and Tenacious D Deported \"Immediately\" Amid Backlash From Dark Joke, Tour Canceled]\n\nAs for his friendship with Gass, Black told Variety that nothing changed. \"Yeah, we're friends. That hasn't changed. These things take time sometimes... And we'll be back when it feels right.\"\n\nWhile making headlines for the comments, Black continues to show his love for Tenacious D.

We had to take a break, but I love the D. Everybody takes a break sometimes. We'll be back.\"\n\nJack had pulled the plug on the band's plans after being \"blindsided\" by Karl's remarks on stage in Sydney, Australia, which came shortly after the presidential hopeful was shot in the ear, one attendee killed and two others injured at a Republican event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe incident occurred when Jack had sang 'Happy Birthday' to Kyle and asked him to make a wish, with his bandmate replying: \"Don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nIn the wake of backlash over the 64-year-old musician's remarks, Frontier Touring postponed another Australian show at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre, which was scheduled for a few days later and Jack then confirmed the concert series is over for good.\n\nHe wrote said in a statement: \"I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday.\n\n\"I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.\n\n\"After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold.\n\n\"I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.\"\n\nKyle also apologised for the \"lack of judgement\" he showed with his \"improvised\" comment.\n\nHe said: \"The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don't condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone.\n\n\"What happened was a tragedy, and I'm incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement.

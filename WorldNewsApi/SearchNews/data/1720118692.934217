Dubois, 26, turned in a career-best performance to stop Hrgovic on Saturday\u2019s Matchroom vs Queensbury card in Saudi Arabia. Dubois mauled Hrgovic in a blistering eighth round with the ringside doctor advising the referee to halt the fight due to cuts over both of the Croatian\u2019s eyes. The victory saw the south Londoner clinch the interim IBF title. Oleksandr Usyk holds the \u2018full\u2019 IBF title after his victory over Tyson Fury last month but could be forced to vacate the belt after his rematch with \u2018The Gypsy King\u2019 was confirmed for December. In that event, Dubois could be upgraded to full world champion. But there is also the possibility of the vacant belt being on the line against Joshua, with that fight now a compelling possibility. \u2018AJ\u2019 was ringside on Saturday night to watch Dubois get a huge win, with his old rival Deontay Wilder also suffering a stunning defeat to Chinese heavyweight Zhilei Zhang. Both Dubois and Zhang are possible opponents for Joshua with the two-time heavyweight champion set to return to Wembley Stadium on 21 September for his next fight. Hrgovic was stopped in the eighth (Picture: Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing/Getty Images) And Dubois has welcomed a showdown with his fellow Briton. \u2018I heard Anthony Joshua is next,\u2019 Dubois said. \u2018I hope the next opponent would be AJ so bring it on. This is my era and this is my time.\u2019 Joshua meanwhile has welcomed fights with both Dubois and Zhang but talked up a potential meeting with his fellow Briton. Joshua was a very interested observer (Picture: Richard Pelham/Getty Images) \u2018I\u2019ve got to pick them off one by one,\u2019 Joshua said. \u2018It\u2019s not going to be easy, but that\u2019s my mentality. So come one, come all. \u2018Wembley, O2, York Hall \u2013 wherever they put me, I\u2019m happy to fight. Any venue, I\u2019ll turn up and do my job. \u2018He\u2019s [Dubois] been in tougher fights, so he becomes hardened. He\u2019s worked his way up the ladder, so we\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u2019 Dubois suffered his first career defeat against Joe Joyce back in November 2020, a loss where he saw his heart questioned after taking a knee in the 10th round. Those doubts grew again after his defeat to Oleksandr Usyk last August but \u2018Triple D\u2019 has gone some way in dismissing concerns over his will in the ring with a hard-fought win over Jarrell Miller in December and Saturday\u2019s triumph over the previously undefeated Hrgovic.", "summary": "Wembley Stadium could host another huge fight in September.", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/02/anthony-joshua-sends-message-daniel-dubois-filip-hrgovic-win-20956398/", "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155651650.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:19:51", "author": "Tony Mogan", "authors": ["Tony Mogan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.15}

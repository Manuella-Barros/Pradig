The season 41 finale, dubbed the \u201cThanks for the memories\u201d show, opened on Friday with a clip from Sajak\u2019s first episode as the host of \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d in 1981 and closed with Sajak\u2019s warm message of gratitude. In his farewell message, Sajak thanked the viewers of the beloved game show for granting him the \u201cincredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes, night after night, year after year, decade after decade.\u201d Sajak, 77, also gave a heartfelt thanks to his \u201cprofessional other half,\u201d Vanna White, who has co-hosted with him for over 40 years and delivered her emotional tribute to Sajak a day earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of changes in each other\u2019s lives over the years, but we\u2019ve always been there for each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI will miss our nightly closes and her laughter and her good nature. She\u2019s a very special woman.\u201d Among the many thanks and shoutouts Sajak offered during the final episode before his retirement, he said the crew and staff, some of whom have been working on the show as long as he has, were a \u201cjoy\u201d to work with. \u201cYour skills and dedication and good humor made this a place I always wanted to be,\u201d he added. Sajak thanked one staff member by name: his daughter Maggie. She began working as the show\u2019s social correspondent in 2021 and he said their collaboration has been the \u201cbest part of the last couple of years.\u201d Sajak also mentioned his son, Patrick, and his wife, Lesly, and said that he is \u201cblessed\u201d to have his family. The famed host also said that the \u201creal stars of the show\u201d have been the contestants who competed for cash and luxury prizes throughout the decades of the show\u2019s run. He called them \u201ckind and considerate,\u201d noting that they always \u201ctook great pride in talking about their family, their hometown, their friends, their schools, their jobs, even their pets.\u201d Reflecting on the show\u2019s massive reach, Sajak noted that he always found it important to keep the daily half-hour show a \u201csafe place for family fun,\u201d excluding any social issues or political topics from the banter he shared with contestants and White. He said he wanted to keep the show \u201cjust a game,\u201d before noting that to many, it became a part of their daily lives. \u201cGradually, it became more than that,\u201d Sajak continued. \u201cA place where kids learned their letters, where people from other countries honed their English skills, where families came together along with friends and neighbors and entire generations. What an honor to have played even a small part in all that.\u201d Sajak\u2019s closed out his message with a crack about how viewers could still see more of him through reruns of the show during its summer break. \u201cThe jokes will be the same, but I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d laugh anyway,\u201d he quipped before saying a final goodbye. To make time for his closing message, Sajak truncated the game by cutting out a round. He said he wanted to ensure the competition was still fair for contestants Tammi, Adrienne and Nino, so Sajak spun the wheel himself and added to their totals. While he initially said he\u2019d add $1,000 to the prize money the wheel landed on, he bumped the bonus up to $5,000 for each person after noting that it wasn\u2019t his money he was allocating. \u201cLittle Jimmy\u2019s surgery can wait,\u201d he joked. During her tribute on Thursday, White called Sajak \u201clike a brother\u201d and a \u201ctrue lifelong friend.\u201d In the pre-recorded video that featured clips and photos of their decades as co-workers, she added that their personal friendship has meant even more than their professional collaboration. Sajak announced in June 2023 that he would retire from his hosting duties at the end of the show\u2019s 41st season, with Ryan Seacrest set to succeed him. White will stay on as Seacrest\u2019s co-host through the 2025-2026 season, based on a contract extension she signed in September.", "summary": "After 41 years and over 8,000 episodes, Pat Sajak made his final turn as the renowned host of \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d on Friday.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/08/pat-sajak-wheel-of-fortune-goodbye/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TV-Wheel_of_Fortune_63975_0a8bec.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:49:34", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.718}

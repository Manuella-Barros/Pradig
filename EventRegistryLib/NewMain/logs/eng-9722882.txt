The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide direct military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nBeijing has expressed displeasure at NATO's growing interest in Asia and has demanded the alliance stay out of the Asia-Pacific region and not incite confrontation.\n\n\"NATO should not use China to justify its insertion into the Asia-Pacific and attempt to disrupt regional dynamics,\" Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said Tuesday. \"China is a force for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order.\"\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step,\" particularly because it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose \"systemic challenges\" to European interests and security.\n\n\"It is a mark of how badly Beijing's attempt to straddle Russia and Western Europe has failed and how hollow its claim of neutrality rings,\" said Russel, who is vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"China's attempts at divide-and-conquer have instead produced remarkable solidarity between key nations of the Euro-Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific regions.\"\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the statement is \"highly significant\" because it signals to China that Europe, just like the U.S., also condemns support to Russia.\n\n\"The U.S. believes that Europe has influence in Beijing, and that while China will not pay any attention to U.S. condemnation, they will pay attention to European condemnation because just because Europe trades with China, China also trades with Europe,\" Bergmann said.\n\nIn this year's final declaration, NATO member countries reiterated their concerns that China poses \"systemic challenges\" to Euro-Atlantic security. It was first raised in 2021.\n\nThe alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over China's space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that China is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyberdefense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide direct military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N.

It was first raised in 2021.\n\nThe alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over China's space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that China is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyberdefense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"},

Washington Convention Center, U.S. President Joe Biden said that Russia was on a \"wartime footing\" and looking to its authoritarian allies to provide resources for its war in Ukraine.\n\n\"They're significantly ramping up their production of weapons, munitions and vehicles, and they're doing it with the help of China, North Korea and Iran,\" Biden said at the opening, calling on the NATO members to similarly increase defense spending to keep up.\n\n\"We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,\" he said, before asking the gathered press to leave the room so the summit could start.\n\nIn a joint statement later issued by the 32 NATO member states, the alliance called for Beijing to stop enabling Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by providing the inputs its military needs to produce weapons and hardware amid otherwise tight U.S.-led trade sanctions.\n\n\"The PRC has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called no-limits partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base,\" the NATO statement says, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\"\n\nThe statement also promises the establishment of a joint NATO training center in Poland, which also shares its eastern border with Ukraine.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBlinken to visit China amid claims about Russia support\n\nSino-Russian alliance has 'concrete, tangible' goals, analysts say\n\nPutin talks tech, energy cooperation in China's Harbin\n\nIt's not the first time accusations about Chinese support for Russia's military industrial base have been made by NATO countries.\n\nAhead of a trip to Beijing in April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused China of \"fueling\" the war in Ukraine through a \"supply of inputs\" required by Russia's defense industry, such as machine tools, microchips and dual-use goods with military uses.\n\nAt a panel event at the summit on Wednesday, Blinken put precise numbers on the claim, saying \"70% of the machine tools\" and \"90% of the microelectronics\" arriving in Russia were coming from China.\n\n\"We've seen a massive buildup of its weaponry over the last year and a half - tanks, missiles, munitions,\" he said. \"That's the product of a defense industrial base being fueled by China. As a result, European allies understand the challenge posed by China to Europe's security.\"\n\nChina, for its part, has not denied the claims, but has insisted it \"has every right to normal economic and trade cooperation\" with Russia.\n\nDrills in Belarus\n\nAt a press briefing in Beijing earlier Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian appealed for NATO to stay in its lane as an alliance between Europe and North American countries.\n\n\"China's position on NATO is consistent,\" Lin said. \"We firmly oppose NATO acting beyond its characterization as a regional defensive alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region.\"\n\nLin also denied that China's ongoing military training with Russia's military in Belarus was related to the NATO summit, saying it was part of a deal inked last week when Belarus became the latest member of a Central Asia-focussed regional group led by Russia and Beijing.\n\n\"The joint army training is part of the annual cooperation plan between China and Belarus,\" he said. \"It is normal military exchange and cooperation between China and Belarus and within international law and common practices, and it's not directed at any particular country.\"\n\nYet against Beijing's appeals for NATO to keep its focus solely on the Atlantic, the pact's leaders have welcomed allies across Asia and the Pacific as observers this year, noting Russia's expansion of its footprint through a reliance on China and North Korea to supply its war effort.\n\nAttending this year's summit are Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who are each attending for the third year in a row, as well as Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles.\n\n'A stake in our success'\n\nNATO leaders have been unapologetic about expanding the alliance's footprint to Asia by including longtime Western allies at summits.\n\nAt the opening of the summit on Tuesday night, Biden had said NATO had become history's most successful military alliance because it had always adapted to the times since its founding with 12 members.\n\n\"We did [adapt], evolving our strategy to stay ahead of threats, reaching out to new partners to increase our effectiveness,\" Biden said, pointing to non-NATO observers at the summit. \"Here with us today are countries from the Indo-Pacific region. They're here because they have a stake in our success, and we have a stake in theirs.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also noted how Russia's invasion of Ukraine is tying together continents and giving allies outside of Europe and North America a stake in NATO's affairs.\n\n\"Our security is interlinked because Iran, North Korea and China are the main enablers of Russia's war against Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg told reporters as he arrived at the summit Wednesday morning.\n\nAt a panel event at the summit hosted by Atlantic Council CEO Frederick Kempe, Stoltenberg said that Iran and North Korea's help to Russia was important but was dwarfed by China's support.\n\n\"China is the main enabler,\" Stoltenberg told the panel. \"They are delivering the tools, the dual-use equipment, the microelectronics, everything Russia needs to build the missiles, the bombs, the aircrafts, and all the other systems that they use against Ukraine.\"\n\nAn inflection in Europe-China ties could soon arrive, he added.\n\n\"If China continues, they cannot have it both ways,\" he said. \"They cannot ... have a kind of normal relationship with NATO allies in North America and Europe, and then fuel a war in Europe that constitutes the biggest challenge to our security since the Second World War.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Free Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_E._Washington_Convention_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walter E.

But many doubt it could prevent Trump from severely curbing U.S. aid to Kyiv if he chose to do so.\n\nRUSSIA\n\nThe alliance also condemned Russia's \"irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling, including its announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus,\" adding that Minsk continues to enable Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nBut allies remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to \"mitigate risk and prevent escalation,\" the declaration said.\n\nCHINA\n\nThe declaration also strengthened past NATO language on China, calling it a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nThe statement called on China to cease all material and political support for Russia's war effort. It also accused Iran and North Korea of fuelling Russia's war in Ukraine by providing direct military support to Moscow.\n\nThe statement expressed concern about China's space capabilities, referenced the rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal and urged Beijing to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions.\n\nINDO-PACIFIC\n\nThe statement discusses the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nThe alliance said it was enhancing cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners, including through support to Ukraine and cyber defense.\n\nThe alliance will meet on Thursday with leaders from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the European Union to discuss security challenges and cooperation.\n\nEU AND NATO\n\nThe statement said that cooperation between NATO and the EU has become more significant in the context of Ukraine, adding that the alliance recognizes the value of a stronger and more capable European defense.\n\nIt said the development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defense capabilities and avoiding unnecessary duplication was key to making the Euro-Atlantic area safer.\n\nThe statement said the alliance will deter and defend against all air and missile threats by enhancing Integrated Air and Missile Defence.\n\nIt said NATO remains committed to taking all necessary steps to ensure the credibility, effectiveness, safety and security of the nuclear deterrence mission.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [],

DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n\"Any transfer of ballistic missiles and related technology by Iran to Russia would represent a substantial escalation,\" they added.\n\nThe leaders stressed that North Korea and Iran are \"fueling Russia's war of aggression\" against Ukraine by providing direct military support to Russia, such as munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles -- a move that they said \"seriously impacts Euro-Atlantic security and undermines the global non-proliferation regime.\"\n\nThey doubled down on their accusations of China's support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"The PRC has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base,\" they said. \"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security.\"\n\nPRC stands for China's official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\nStressing China's position as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, the leaders called on Beijing to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\n\n\"This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defense sector,\" they said. \"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.\"\n\nThey went on to say that China poses \"systemic\" challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\n\"We have seen sustained malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation, stemming from the PRC. We call on the PRC to uphold its commitment to act responsibly in cyberspace,\" they said. \"We are concerned by developments in the PRC's space capabilities and activities. We call on the PRC to support international efforts to promote responsible space behavior.\"\n\nThe leaders highlighted the need for cooperation with NATO's four Indo-Pacific partners -- South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security. We welcome the continued contributions of our Asia-Pacific partners to Euro-Atlantic security,\" they said.\n\nThey noted that NATO and the Indo-Pacific partners are enhancing practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation and technology.\n\n\"These projects will enhance our ability to work together on shared

Instead, they said they would \"be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree, and conditions are met.\"\n\n\"We welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms,\" the leaders said in the Washington Summit Declaration, released after a meeting of NATO's North Atlantic Council Wednesday.\n\n\"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,\" the declaration said.\n\nThe declaration outlined the alliance's ongoing support for Kyiv, including previous announcements on new air defense systems and the establishment of the \"NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners.\"\n\nThe description of Ukraine's path as \"irreversible\" comes after months of diplomatic negotiations in the lead up to the Washington Summit and was a point of contention among the allies. Prior to the release of the declaration, some diplomats had argued that it was not enough to just describe the path as \"irreversible,\" but that there must be strong support undergirding that description.\n\nMoving the training and equipment coordination under the auspices of NATO has been seen by many as a way to ensure ongoing support for Kyiv in the case of the reelection of former US President Donald Trump. Officials have quietly expressed concerns about what a second Trump presidency could mean for the defensive alliance and for the military support for Kyiv as Russia's war in Ukraine continues with little sign of a military or diplomatic conclusion.\n\nThere is \"a growing and understandable doubt about the future of Western support\" for Ukraine, a European diplomat said last week.\n\nThe aim of the NSATU \"is to place security assistance to Ukraine on an enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable, and coherent support,\" the declaration said, noting that it \"will not, under international law, make NATO a party to the conflict.\"\n\n\"It will support the transformation of Ukraine's defence and security forces, enabling its further integration with NATO,\" the declaration said.\n\nThe leaders also announced \"a pledge of long-term support\" to Ukraine, with the intention \"to provide a minimum baseline funding of \u20ac40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail.\"\n\nThe declaration also expressed \"profound concern\" over the \"deepening strategic partnership\" between China and Russia \"and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order.\"\n\nThe declaration calls Beijing \"a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base,\" and calls on China, \"as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\"\n\nIt noted that China \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" echoing the growing public concern from the US and European allies about Beijing's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.

The draft details China's supply of dual-use materials such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defense sector.\n\nThe US briefed NATO allies on China's support in the run-up to the summit as part of efforts to cement shared concern over the burgeoning defense partnership, the people said. The draft document says that China poses \"systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,\" including through cyber activities and disinformation as well as its development of counter-space capabilities.\n\nThe wording of the draft could change before the final version is released Thursday. China's embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSwedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said \"it would be very unwise\" for China to deliver weapons to Russia.\n\nAllies have noted \"that China and Russia are collaborating deeply in the defense field,\" including with more joint military exercises and Beijing providing a lot of dual use equipment, Jonson said in an interview. \"They've been increasing that support and that's a great concern.\"\n\nUS officials have said China is holding off directly providing weapons and artillery, something that would signal an unprecedented escalation and almost certainly trigger more forceful action -- such as sanctions -- against the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nStill, European capitals were alarmed by reports this month that Chinese and Russian companies are developing an attack drone similar to an Iranian model deployed in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported earlier.\n\nThe push from NATO shows a growing consensus between the US and its partners that Beijing represents a threat not just in Asia, but also to European security through its support for Russia. In recent years, European capitals from Berlin to London, Prague and Vilnius have hardened their stance on China.\n\nBloomberg also reported in April that Beijing was providing Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, microelectronics and machine tools for tanks, as well as a swath of technologies used in weapons or needed to produce them.\n\nBack in May, former UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps provoked a tiff with Washington when he suggested that China was working to provide Russia with lethal aid. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that to date, the US hadn't seen China providing weapons directly to Russia.\n\nWith assistance from Milda Seputyte and Andrea Palasciano.", "source":

The PRC continues to rapidly expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\"\n\nThose statements represent a substantial shift in tone from just a few years ago when a spare reference to the \"opportunities and challenges\" presented by China marked the alliance's first mention of the communist regime in a NATO summit document.\n\nYet Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has forced the United States and its allies to cast a wary eye on military and technological developments in China, particularly given Beijing's role as a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's military.\n\n\"The People's Republic of China's (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies continue to challenge our interests, security and values,\" the allies said. \"The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order, are a cause for profound concern. We are confronted by hybrid, cyber, space, and other threats and malicious activities from state and non-state actors.\"\n\nThe angst about China percolated around Washington even though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the trans-Atlantic alliance's support for Ukraine is taking center stage. While the war in Ukraine has exposed the inadequacy of Western investments in customary defense industry necessities such as the production of artillery and other weapons, China looms as a perceived threat on the cutting edge of technology.\n\n\"What I see when I look at all of us, especially in Europe, is that China is going to win this race. I'm not afraid if the U.S. is going to win the race, but if China is going to win this race, then I am afraid,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said during an appearance at the NATO Public Forum on the sidelines of the summit. \"China is way ahead of Europe. ... We cannot do this on our own, but please be aware about China, and let us not repeat the mistakes we have done about Russia, in the future, with China.\"\n\nFrederiksen hailed the presence of the leaders of Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan at the NATO summit as potential flags to mark a path to victory in the technology race, a sentiment echoed in the summit declaration.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security,\" the leaders agreed. \"We welcome the continued contributions of our Asia-Pacific partners to Euro-Atlantic security. We are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation, and technology. These projects will enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"\n\nThe allies' general misgiving about China's space and nuclear programs was punctuated by a sharper suspicion about Russia's priorities: \"We oppose any placement of nuclear weapons in orbit around Earth, which would violate Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, and would gravely threaten global security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNATO allies have agreed to \"accelerat[e] the integration of space into our planning, exercises, and multi-domain operations\" -- backstopped by the nuclear forces of the alliance.\n\n\"NATO's deterrence and defense posture is based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities,\" they said. \"We will employ military and non-military tools in a proportionate, coherent and integrated way to deter all threats to our security and respond in the

DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n\"Any transfer of ballistic missiles and related technology by Iran to Russia would represent a substantial escalation,\" they added.\n\nThe leaders stressed that North Korea and Iran are \"fueling Russia's war of aggression\" against Ukraine by providing direct military support to Russia, such as munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles -- a move that they said \"seriously impacts Euro-Atlantic security and undermines the global non-proliferation regime.\"\n\nThey doubled down on their accusations of China's support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\nYoon, Kishida hold talks on sidelines of NATO summit to discuss N. Korea 2024-07-11 07:32 | Foreign Affairs\n\n\"The PRC has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base,\" they said. \"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security.\"\n\nPRC stands for China's official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\nStressing China's position as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, the leaders called on Beijing to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\n\n\"This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defense sector,\" they said. \"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.\"\n\nThey went on to say that China poses \"systemic\" challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\n\"We have seen sustained malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation, stemming from the PRC. We call on the PRC to uphold its commitment to act responsibly in cyberspace,\" they said. \"We are concerned by developments in the PRC's space capabilities and activities. We call on the PRC to support international efforts to promote responsible space behavior.\"\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg holds a press conference, during NATO's 75th anniversary summit, in Washington D.C., Wednesday. Reuters-Yonhap\n\nThe leaders highlighted the need for cooperation with NATO's four Indo-Pacific partners -- South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security. We welcome the continued contributions of our Asia-Pacific partners to Euro-Atlantic security,\" they said.\n\nThey noted that NATO and the Indo-Pacific partners are enhancing practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation and technology.\n\n\"These projects will enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests,\" they said.

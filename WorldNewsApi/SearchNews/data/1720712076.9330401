{"id": 231931326, "title": "Is long haul truck driving the perfect guise for a serial killer?", "text": "If there\u2019s a perfect career for a serial killer, a long haul truck driver just might be it. They are often loners, living a nomadic lifestyle that involves constant travel across state lines and jurisdictions, providing easy access to an array of potential victims and allowing truckers to evade law enforcement for years. A new book by former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence Frank Figliuzzi \u2013 Long Haul: Hunting the Highway Serial Killers \u2013 offers a terrifying glimpse into the world of these America\u2019s serial killer truck drivers. At least 850 murders along America\u2019s highways over the past few decades have been linked to long haul truck drivers, according to the FBI Highway Serial Killings initiative. Keith Hunter Jesperson, a long haul trucker from Canada best known as the \u201cHappy Face Killer,\u201d terrorized women at rest areas and bars across the country in the early nineties, killing his conquests in at least five states during his murderous spree. In previous conversations with The Independent, he has nonchalantly recounted his tales of strangling women when they angered him and dumping their bodies, which he referred to as \u201ctaking care of business.\u201d One woman was anxious to keep moving to her destination, but Jesperson was eager to sleep. \u201cI said, \u2018Just let me have four hours of sleep and everything will be fine.\u201d he told the true-crime podcast The Lighter Side of Serial Killers. \u201cAbout 20 minutes later she pushed on me and I got angry and she died.\u201d Figliuzzi said his research revealed truckers\u2019 jobs allow them to \u201cgrab a victim in one jurisdiction, kill them in a second jurisdiction, dump their body in a third jurisdiction \u2013 and be on their way before anyone has figured anything out.\u201d And Jesperson himself explains exactly how trucking helped him get rid of bodies. He worried that the victim could be linked back to him because he assumed she had a criminal record and she had used his credit card to make a call so he decided he needed to remove her identity. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can put the body under my truck, drag it down I-80 and get rid of her identification, at least her facial features or fingerprints and so forth.\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s what he did. Later in the same decade, another long haul trucker \u2013 Wayne Adam Ford \u2013 walked into the Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office in California and confessed to killing four women. He then handed over a plastic bag that contained the breast of one of his victims. And there\u2019s the \u201cTruck Stop Killer,\u201d Robert Ben Rhoades, who built a torture chamber in the back of his truck where he kidnapped, tortured, raped, and killed as many as 50 suspected victims. These men are some of America\u2019s most notorious highway serial killers. They\u2019ve been caught and are spending the rest of their lives in prison. But there are hundreds more who are still out there. More than 200 cases of highway murders remain active and unsolved, with the bureau making its way through a list of about 450 suspects. The book also highlights Bruce Mendenhall, who like Rhoades is known as \u201cThe Truck Stop Killer\u201d or \u201cThe Rest Stop Killer,\u201d and also the \u201cThe Prosti-Shooter.\u201d His truck was found to contain the blood of numerous murdered women. He was convicted in one murder and is charged with the slayings of three other women at truck stops in Alabama, Indiana and Tennessee. He is still under investigation for murders in Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Dellmus Colvin, \u201cThe Interstate Strangler,\u201d reportedly killed between 47 and 52 women, most of them women working as sex workers, for the sheer pleasure of killing, and \u201calways slept well at night,\u201d according to the book. \u201cThis book started as an interest in the FBI\u2019s Highway Serial Killings Initiative but quickly became a quest to understand the cultures beneath the killings,\u201d Figliuzzi said about his book, which was released on May 28. \u201cThe truckers and the trafficked, the professors and the pimps, the cops and the crime analysts took me on a journey to places I hadn\u2019t anticipated, populated by people I never knew. They allowed me into their worlds, their realities, and their stories.\u201d Figliuzzi tagged along with a truck driver for more than 2,000 miles to understand the subculture from the inside. He found that it was mentally and physically taxing work, often tedious and solitary, and can take a toll on the driver\u2019s health. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the negative side of the culture that they\u2019re incredibly sedentary for hours on end. There\u2019s little or no human engagement, depending on the type of trucking you\u2019re doing,\u201d Figliuzzi told The Guardian. So does the grueling work take a toll on truckers, driving them to kill? Or are people with serial killer tendencies drawn to this occupation because of the lifestyle? \u201cA certain type of personality might be attracted to long-haul trucking because of their personality since it is isolated and they\u2019re perfectly fine with that and the lack of engagement with others,\u201d Figliuzzi told The Guardian. \u201cDoes it present to them an opportunity to commit crimes, even murders, largely undetected, exploit the seams in jurisdictions \u2013 grab a victim in one jurisdiction, kill them in a second jurisdiction, dump their body in a third jurisdiction \u2013 and be on their way before anyone has figured anything out? Yes.\u201d According to the FBI, long-haul truckers are the ones responsible in most cases of highway homicide. \u201cLong-haul truckers exist for days or weeks at a time in a world of their own. They speak their own language, eat at their own establishments, sleep in their own rigs,\u201d Figliuzzi writes in his new book. \u201cPart cowboy, part fighter pilot, part hermit, long-haul truckers glide along the edge of a certain seam in the fabric of our society\u2014the seam that separates their reality from ours.\u201d Another part of the focus falls on the investigators \u2013 and their plan to combat the highway killings. Highway Serial Killings initiative was created by the FBI in 2009, to raise awareness among law enforcement agencies and the general public about this issue. A map on the website is covered with red dots marking the 500 locations where bodies have been discovered along America\u2019s highways over the past 30 years. A closer look shows many of them form a horizontal trail across the south/central part of the country following Interstate 40. I-40 from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Barstow, California. Figliuzzi also spoke to women who survived terrifying encounters with truckers. He said part of his book is about understanding the victims, who overwhelmingly end up being at-risk women forced into the sex trade. \u201cThe reason these cases go unsolved for decades is because these killers are exploiting gaps in jurisdiction with law enforcement,\u201d Figliuzzi told The Guardian. \u201cThe victims are often transient and no one even knows they\u2019re missing.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that people will come to a greater understanding of the trap of trafficking in our society,\u201d Figliuzzi said. \u201cNo one really champions the cause or speaks for these deceased victims because their lives have been snuffed out.\u201d", "summary": "<p>A new book by former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi offers a terrifying glimpse into the world of some of America\u2019s most notorious serial killers \u2013 long haul truck drivers \u2013 including Happy Face Killer and Wayne Adam Ford, revealing how they are able to go undetected for decades.

Now, China wants to play catch-up.\n\nChina has launched its own version of Starlink satellites to compete with SpaceX in providing high-speed internet services from space.\n\nShanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology, a state-owned company that makes low Earth orbit satellites similar to Starlink, launched 18 satellites into space today (6 August) according to Chinese broadcaster CCTV and reported on by Reuters.\n\nThe launch took place from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre in the northern Shanxi province of China. CCTV reported that the satellites were launched aboard a Long March 6 rocket and represent the first batch in the company's so-called Thousand Sails Constellation.\n\nAs of late last month, there were more than 6,000 Starlink satellites in orbit, according to astronomer Jonathan McDowell who tracks the constellation on his website.\n\nThe satellites make high-speed internet more accessible to remote parts of the world, including the Black Valley in Co Kerry. Earlier this year, Musk launched Starlink satellite internet services in Indonesia to boost connectivity in remote parts of the island nation.\n\nLow Earth orbit satellites usually operate at altitudes of up to 2,000km from the Earth's surface and can provide cheaper and more efficient connectivity than those at higher altitudes.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Chinese state media affiliated to the People's Liberation Army have often highlighted the threats Starlink poses to China militarily, describing the private company's dominance as part of a \"space hegemony\" held by the US.\n\nSpaceX, of which Starlink is a subsidiary, is the foremost private space-tech company in the world. It was recently selected by NASA to create a spacecraft that will de-orbit the International Space Station when it comes to the end of its life at the end of the decade.\n\nWhile impressive, many are worried about the number of satellites taking up space in the sky. Astronomers and stargazers have raised concerns about making the night sky too bright to see constellations. Others have said the sheer volume of satellites could mean traffic jams in space, interferences with other missions, collisions and an increase of space debris.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

This initiative is part of SSST's \"Thousand Sails Constellation\" project, also known as the \"G60 Starlink Plan,\" which commenced last year with a goal of deploying over 15,000 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.\n\nLEO satellites, operating at altitudes between 300km and 2,000km, offer cost advantages and more efficient transmission compared to those in higher orbits.\n\nStarlink, operated by billionaire Elon Musk, has already established a significant user base in the United States and aims to expand by adding tens of thousands of satellites to its network, making it the largest of its kind.\n\nChinese researchers in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have been analyzing Starlink's deployment, particularly in the context of the Ukraine conflict, and have voiced concerns about its implications for China in the event of a military confrontation with the United States. An op-ed in a PLA publication in January labeled Starlink's deployment as a \"serious threat to the security of space assets of various countries.\"\n\nSSST's \"Thousand Sails Constellation\" is one of three extensive satellite projects China is pursuing to bridge the gap with SpaceX. The plan aims to launch 108 satellites this year, 648 by the end of 2025, achieve global network coverage by 2027, and deploy 15,000 satellites by 2030.\n\nImplications for the future\n\nThis strategic move by China highlights the intensifying competition in space technology, especially in the realm of global internet networks. The ability to control and utilize such vast satellite constellations can significantly enhance a nation's communication infrastructure and its strategic military capabilities.\n\nThe rapid deployment and expansion of satellite networks like Starlink and the Thousand Sails Constellation raise important questions about space traffic management and the risk of collisions in low Earth orbit. As more nations and private entities launch their own satellite arrays, the need for international cooperation and regulation becomes increasingly critical to prevent orbital congestion.\n\nChina's ambitious plans reflect its broader goals of becoming a leader in space technology and reducing reliance on foreign technology. This endeavor is also a clear message to the world about China's capabilities and intentions in the new space race.", "source": {"uri": "technology.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technology Org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiyuan_Satellite_Launch_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanxi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanxi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_traffic_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space traffic management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outline of space technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalism_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internationalism (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite constellation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Television", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Television", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/megaconstellation-coverage-ESA-science-office-720x535.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786735", "eventUri": "eng-9786735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Each is expected to field 10,000 or more satellites.\n\nMost are anticipated to orbit between 200 and 1,200 miles above the Earth's surface, which is also where Starlink satellites are generally found.\n\nThe three constellations, along with dozens of ambitious space projects from other Chinese firms, have been fueled by a recent push from the central government to loop the private sector into its science and technology goals.\n\nBeijing hopes to create its own versions of vital technologies and infrastructure in a bid to make its industries self-reliant and hedged against possible foreign influence or pressures -- or if needed, war with the United States or its allies.\n\nShanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology is backed by the Shanghai municipal government, but Reuters reported that it's also raised funds from private investors and state-owned enterprises for its Thousand Sails Constellation.\n\nThe two other constellations are expected to bring another 23,000 Chinese satellites into orbit to provide internet services.\n\nChina SpaceSat, a contractor owned by a state-run enterprise, plans to deliver 13,000 satellites as part of its Guowang, or National Network, constellation.\n\nCommercial manufacturer Landray Hongqing is building the Crane-3 constellation, which, according to its filings, is anticipated to field 10,000 satellites.\n\nThe China Securities Journal estimated that the country's space industry will be worth $321 billion in 2024.\n\nCommercial aerospace stocks surged by their maximum daily price increases amid Monday's launch, per the outlet. The Shenzhen stock exchange prevents stock prices from rising or falling by 10% of their value from the closing of the previous trading day.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_loh@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Matthew Loh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constellation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Securities_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China Securities Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanxi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanxi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiyuan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiyuan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taiyuan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Television", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b19a95a5247369a3e9a725-scaled.jpg?ver=1722920489", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786735", "eventUri": "eng-9786735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Finally, by 2030, it hopes to operate more than 14,000 satellites to provide multi-service integration directly to mobile devices.\n\nThe satellites launched this time were produced by GeneSat in Shanghai. In an interview with the Shanghai Securities News in June, an executive from GeneSat revealed plans to \u201cexplore launching configurations of 36 and 54 satellites per rocket to accelerate the pace of launches\u201d.\n\nLEO satellites operate between 160 and 2,000km (100-1,200 miles) above Earth, offering reduced transmission delays and lower link losses compared with geostationary satellites, making them highly suitable for satellite internet services.\n\nStarlink exemplifies this type of communication, creating a satellite Wi-fi network that, once operational, allows high-speed, seamless internet access anywhere on the ground.\n\nLEO satellites can also offer quicker communications across oceans compared with undersea cables and are strategically important due to their minimal blind spots and cost-effectiveness in remote areas.\n\nBut given the limited space available in orbit, the global race for LEO satellite resources has intensified.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s SpaceX plans to launch 42,000 satellites by 2027, while China has told the International Telecommunication Union it intends to deploy 51,300 satellites.\n\nBesides Qianfan, other large-scale Chinese projects being planned include China Satellite Network Group\u2019s GW constellation, which is expected to launch 12,992 satellites, and Lanjian Aerospace\u2019s Honghu-3 project, which will deploy around 10,000, according to digital blogger Li Yan.\n\nWith its early start, the United States currently holds a significant lead in the number of satellites in orbit.\n\n\u201cThe future of satellite internet is likely to see fierce competition between the US, China, the European Union and Russia, said Zhang Rui, a council member of the China Market Research Society.\n\n\u201cThese are the only major economies with integrated capabilities in satellite manufacturing, launching, ground equipment and operational services.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning

Elon Musk has said that he plans to eventually host a network of 42,000 satellites.\n\nThe Thousand Sails Constellation, also known as the G60 project, is one of three planned major satellite networks in the country.

The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) announced launch success just over two hours later.\n\nThe Long March 6A upper stage deployed 18 flat panel Qianfan (\"Thousand Sails\") satellites into polar orbit for Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST).\n\nSSST plans for the constellation's first stage to consist of 1,296 satellites. 648 of these are to be launched by the end of 2025 to provide regional network coverage.\n\nEarlier statements indicate that 108 satellites are planned for launch across 2024. These are expected to be launched in separate batches of 36 and 54 satellites. The completed network will consist of more than 14,000 low Earth orbit broadband multimedia satellites.\n\nThe Thousand Sails constellation aims to provide global internet access. It is one of two planned Chinese systems to challenge U.S. projects including Starlink. Thousand Sails is also intended to secure finite orbital slots and frequencies, and provide national internet coverage and data security.\n\nThe Chinese military has noted the potential military applications of such constellations, citing the use of satellites in Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe low Earth orbit megaconstellation was earlier known as the G60 Starlink constellation. SSST announced in February it had raised 6.7 billion yuan ($943 million) for the constellation's construction. Established in Shanghai's Songjiang District in 2021, SSST's project is also supported by the municipal government.\n\nShanghai has developed its own commercial space action plan, of which Thousand Sails is just one aspect. Shanghai's goals include fostering new generation medium and large launch vehicles and intelligent terminals. It also intends to strengthen the development of integrated communications, navigation and remote sensing satellite technologies. Shanghai aims to create a space information industry worth more than 200 billion yuan ($28.2 billion) by 2025. Beijing also has its own commercial space action with measurable goals.\n\nThe plan also benefits from central government support, with commercial space last year designated as an \"industry of the future.\" The sector was subsequently noted as a priority in a government work report for the first time in March this year.\n\nThousand sails is not the only Chinese megaconstellation. The national Guowang (SatNet) 13,000-satellite project is being run by the China Satellite Network Group, set up in 2021. Its first batch of satellites is also soon expected to launch. However updates on the project are few and far between.\n\nChina's plans for megaconstellations also require a huge growth in launch capabilities. The country is expected to utilize expected launch capacity from the country's emergent commercial space sector to help realize these plans. The first launches of a number of new, reusable medium-lift launchers are expected across 2025.\n\nThe first pads of a commercial spaceport near Wenchang, Hainan island, have been completed. Further launch pads will also assist the required surge in launch rate.\n\nThe Long March 6A rocket used for Tuesday's launch combines liquid propellant core stages with solid rocket boosters. The launcher can carry 4,500 kg to a 700-km sun-synchronous orbit. The rocket's upper stage appears to have suffered debris issues in orbit.\n\nThe launch was China's 35th orbital launch of 2024. CASC stated in February that China aimed to launch around 100 times this year. It added that commercial launch providers will account for around roughly 30 of these launches.", "source": {"uri": "spacenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceNews"}, "authors": [{"uri":

What Will Be Their Impact on Astronomy?", "body": "Mention the name Starlink among the astronomy community and you will often be greeted with a shudder. There are now thousands of Starlink satellites orbiting Earth providing internet connectivity to every corner of the Earth. Many believe they are making astronomy difficult but now, SpaceX is launching another service; 'direct-to-cell' technology that will allow mobile phones to use satellites to send text messages as early as this year. Voice and data services are likely to follow on quickly next year. With smaller antennae at a lower altitude what is their impact on astronomy?\n\nThe SpaceX Starlink satellite project provides high speed broadband to ever corner of the globe (I know globes don't have corners but it's a saying that I didn't write, I'm just using it.... reluctantly.) Thousands of small satellites are now in low Earth orbit to achieve that aim. It's great news to those that live in remote parts of Earth and it has massive benefits to communications and support applications like disaster relief, medicine and remote learning. To astronomers attempting to study the faintest light from distant objects across the cosmos the satellites are problematic, having a negative impact on many observations.\n\nSpaceX have gone to great lengths to minimise the impact from their satellites but now they are launching more to service direct messaging from mobile phones, via satellite. With even more satellites in orbit, at a lower orbit too, concerns are mounting of their impact on astronomical observations. The new satellites will have a mean magnitude of 4.62, this is 4.9 times brighter than other Starlink Mini spacecraft! Currently there are only 6 'direct-to-cell' satellites in orbit but the plan is for over 7,000 to join them.\n\nFour researchers; Anthony Mallama, Richard E. Cole, Scott Harrington and J. Respler from the International Astronomical Union have studied the new suite of satellites to see what impact they may have on future observations. In their paper they describe just how they analysed the visibility and how they estimated the brightness of the new mini satellites.\n\nThe analysis process began with electronic and visual observations of the 6 test satellites. The electronic observations were taken using the MMT9 (Mini-MegaTORTORA) system at the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia. It is made up of 9 x 71mm diameter lenses and 2160 x 2560 CMOS detectors. The brightness observations were recorded along with the satellite distance and phase angle of which both would impact brightness.\n\nThe visual observations techniques is similar to that which is familiar to variable star observers. Brightness estimates are made using nearby reference stars whose brightness is known. They then characterise them before reassessing the impact on the new DTC satellites and the existing internet satellites.\n\nDespite having arrived at an estimate of brightness 4.9 times brighter than the existing satellites, they are unable to conclude how the different attitudes and operations will impact their brightness. Taking into account their expected operations the brightness is more likely to be just 2.6 times brighter than the existing. They will however, spend far more of their time in Earth's shadow so will be less visible.", "source": {"uri": "universetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Universe Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_thompson@universetoday.com", "name": "Mark Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antenna (radio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosmos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apparent magnitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/StarlinkDTC.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786735", "eventUri": "eng-9786735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Satellites in the mega constellation are divided into 2 types, namely, the basic satellites and the accompanying satellites. All basic satellites that are surrounded by accompanying satellites are evenly distributed globally, and they have the same subsatellite trajectory. A basic satellite and its accompanying satellites are defined as a satellite group. The constellation is composed of many satellite groups, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFirst, satellites in the mega constellation are categorized and the constellation design based on different satellite division is proposed. Satellites in the mega constellation are divided into 2 types, namely, the basic satellites and the accompanying satellites. All basic satellites that are surrounded by accompanying satellites are evenly distributed globally, and they have the same subsatellite trajectory. A basic satellite and its accompanying satellites are defined as a satellite group. The constellation is composed of many satellite groups, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nAs for basic satellites, the semimajor axis a of regression orbit can be numerically solved considering (1) that regression orbit requires a satellite flies R times around Earth in D days and (2) that the influence of J2 perturbation force of an orbit is considered. Assuming that the ground coverage width of a satellite group is d, the number of basic orbital plane is N = ceiling(2\u03c0R/d) where ceiling(\u22c5) is the round up function. Assuming that the maximum response time to complete Earth observation mission required by the user is mt and the orbital plane is evenly divided according to the orbital period T, the number of basic satellites in each orbital plane is N = ceiling(T/mt). Based on above analysis, input the i, e, and \u03c9 of the constellation and Q = R/D, then the basic satellites constellation is designed.\n\nAs for accompanying satellites, they have the semimajor axis with basic satellites. According to the Clohessy-Wiltshire equation, the relative motion trajectory between the basic satellites and the accompanying satellites is an ellipse. Then, considering that the position vectors at the initial time and T/2 relative to the basic satellite is oppositive, the orbital elements of the first accompanying satellites can be solved. Assuming that the imaging width of a single satellite is sd, the number of accompanying satellites in a satellite group is N = ceiling(d/sd - 1). Divide the trajectory of the first accompanying satellite relative to basic satellite orbital coordinate system in chronological order, extract the position vectors of all equal points under the orbital system, and use these as the position vectors of other accompanying satellites under the basic satellite orbital system at initial time.\n\nCombining the basic and accompanying satellites' orbits, the configuration of mega constellation is obtained.\n\nFig. 1. Orbital distribution of LEO mega constellation.\n\nThen, the orbit parameters of satellite and its companions are set as initial values, and the precise orbits under the High Precision Orbit Propagator model are solved in the neighborhood by using the Nondominated Sort Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Transform the orbital elements of any basic satellite into position and velocity information, which is recorded as {px, py, pz, vx, vy, vz}. Add an increment to build their neighborhood, which can be expressed to {\u0394px, \u0394py, \u0394pz, \u0394vx, \u0394vy, \u0394vz}. The optimization variable of accompanying satellite orbit is the position and velocity increment of all basic satellites. The optimization objective f for the basic satellite configuration is to minimize the absolute difference between the ascending and descending nodes of any basic satellite bs in cycle i, and the ascending and descending nodes of bs as much as possible. The optimization objective f of the accompanying satellite is to keep the relative position as close as possible under the basic satellite orbit system at multiple subsequent motion periods. Optimization iteration process involves continuously approaching the Pareto front. In practice, find all nondominant solutions of the initial individual as the optimal solution set. Calculate 2 optimization objectives of everyone in sequence, and use the nearest global nondominated individual and own historical nondominated individual as learning objects. Update individual optimization variables and variable increments based on population information, individual experience, and self-inertia, as shown in Fig. 10. Then calculate the f and f of newly generated individuals again, and regenerate the global Pareto front and individual historical Pareto front. After a fixed number of cycles or objective function is less than the threshold, the iteration ends and the global Pareto front can be obtained. At this point, the final constellation configuration can be selected based on user preferences or linear superposition of f and f.\n\nFinally, the correctness of the configuration design method is verified by numerical simulation. In the simulation, set the constellation orbital inclination as 66\u00b0, eccentricity as 0, argument of perigee as 0, simulation time as 1 d, set regression coefficient Q = 15, initial ascending node as 0, initial MA as 0, imaging width of a satellite group as 1500 km, imaging width of single satellite as 140 km, and maximum working time of single satellite to orbit single circle as 35 min.

Satellites in the mega constellation are divided into 2 types, namely, the basic satellites and the accompanying satellites. All basic satellites that are surrounded by accompanying satellites are evenly distributed globally, and they have the same subsatellite trajectory. A basic satellite and its accompanying satellites are defined as a satellite group. The constellation is composed of many satellite groups, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nAs for basic satellites, the semimajor axis a of regression orbit can be numerically solved considering (1) that regression orbit requires a satellite flies R times around Earth in D days and (2) that the influence of J2 perturbation force of an orbit is considered. Assuming that the ground coverage width of a satellite group is d, the number of basic orbital plane is N = ceiling(2\u03c0R/d) where ceiling(\u22c5) is the round up function. Assuming that the maximum response time to complete Earth observation mission required by the user is mt and the orbital plane is evenly divided according to the orbital period T, the number of basic satellites in each orbital plane is N = ceiling(T/mt). Based on above analysis, input the i, e, and \u03c9 of the constellation and Q = R/D, then the basic satellites constellation is designed.\n\nAs for accompanying satellites, they have the semimajor axis with basic satellites. According to the Clohessy-Wiltshire equation, the relative motion trajectory between the basic satellites and the accompanying satellites is an ellipse. Then, considering that the position vectors at the initial time and T/2 relative to the basic satellite is oppositive, the orbital elements of the first accompanying satellites can be solved. Assuming that the imaging width of a single satellite is sd, the number of accompanying satellites in a satellite group is N = ceiling(d/sd - 1). Divide the trajectory of the first accompanying satellite relative to basic satellite orbital coordinate system in chronological order, extract the position vectors of all equal points under the orbital system, and use these as the position vectors of other accompanying satellites under the basic satellite orbital system at initial time.\n\nCombining the basic and accompanying satellites' orbits, the configuration of mega constellation is obtained.\n\nFig. 1. Orbital distribution of LEO mega constellation.\n\nThen, the orbit parameters of satellite and its companions are set as initial values, and the precise orbits under the High Precision Orbit Propagator model are solved in the neighborhood by using the Nondominated Sort Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Transform the orbital elements of any basic satellite into position and velocity information, which is recorded as {px, py, pz, vx, vy, vz}. Add an increment to build their neighborhood, which can be expressed to {\u0394px, \u0394py, \u0394pz, \u0394vx, \u0394vy, \u0394vz}. The optimization variable of accompanying satellite orbit is the position and velocity increment of all basic satellites. The optimization objective f for the basic satellite configuration is to minimize the absolute difference between the ascending and descending nodes of any basic satellite bs in cycle i, and the ascending and descending nodes of bs as much as possible. The optimization objective f of the accompanying satellite is to keep the relative position as close as possible under the basic satellite orbit system at multiple subsequent motion periods. Optimization iteration process involves continuously approaching the Pareto front. In practice, find all nondominant solutions of the initial individual as the optimal solution set. Calculate 2 optimization objectives of everyone in sequence, and use the nearest global nondominated individual and own historical nondominated individual as learning objects. Update individual optimization variables and variable increments based on population information, individual experience, and self-inertia, as shown in Fig. 10. Then calculate the f and f of newly generated individuals again, and regenerate the global Pareto front and individual historical Pareto front. After a fixed number of cycles or objective function is less than the threshold, the iteration ends and the global Pareto front can be obtained. At this point, the final constellation configuration can be selected based on user preferences or linear superposition of f and f.\n\nFig. 10. Individual update process.\n\nFinally, the correctness of the configuration design method is verified by numerical simulation. In the simulation, set the constellation orbital inclination as 66\u00b0, eccentricity as 0, argument of perigee as 0, simulation time as 1 d, set regression coefficient Q = 15, initial ascending node as 0, initial MA as 0, imaging width of a satellite group as 1500 km, imaging width of single satellite as 140 km, and maximum working time of single satellite to orbit single circle as 35 min. During the optimization, it can be observed that the approximation speed of the Pareto front in the first 100 generations is extremely fast. As the number of iteration increases, the variation of the Pareto front gradually decreases and eventually becomes stable. In the final generation of nondominated solutions, we select the individual of f1 = 1.981 and f2 = 9516.482 as the final solution, and the constellation configuration is shown in Fig. 15. The constellation has a total of 891 satellites, of which 81 basic satellites are evenly distributed, with 10 accompanying satellites evenly distributed around each basic satellite.

In May, the company successfully demoed a video call, and said it is working with T-Mobile to roll out such cellular service to customers later this year. There are now over 100 DTC satellites in low Earth orbit, including 13 that were launched last week. Following successful testing of the first batch of DTCs, in March SpaceX requested an amendment to their license with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that would allow them to operate up to 7,500 DTCs in LEO.\n\nAt the time the study was conducted, SpaceX had not yet applied its routine brightness mitigation techniques to the DTCs, such as adjusting their chassis and solar panels to reduce the portion of spacecraft illuminated by the sun, study lead author Anthony Mallama of the IAU Centre for the Protection of Dark and Quiet Skies from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU-CPS) told Space.com.\n\nRelated: Blinded by the light: How bad are satellite megaconstellations for astronomy?\n\nKate Tice, SpaceX senior manager for quality systems engineering, acknowledged during the launch webcast in January that DTC satellites will be brighter than regular Starlinks, and said the company plans to work with astronomers to assess the impact on their observations before making hardware adjustments that would dim the DTCs, SpaceNews reported.\n\nSpaceX began applying brightness mitigation techniques to regular Starlinks in 2020, after astronomers voiced serious concerns about the satellites' trails streaking across telescope images, rendering them unusable. Prior to launch, the company now applies a mirror-like dielectric surface to the underside of each Starlink chassis, to help reflect sunlight into space rather than scattering it toward Earth. Post launch, the company adjusts spacecraft chassis and solar panels to further reduce luminosity. Together, these techniques are very effective, reducing Starlink satellites' brightness by a factor of 10, Mallama said.\n\nIf SpaceX applies these brightness mitigation techniques to the DTCs, which are nearly the same size as the regular Starlinks, the DTCs would still be 2.6 times brighter than their traditional counterparts, Mallama and his colleagues reported in the recent study, which was reviewed internally by IAU-CPS and posted to the preprint server arXiv last month.\n\nHowever, while DTCs are brighter objects, they move at a faster apparent rate and spend more time in Earth's shadow than regular Starlinks, which would offset some of their negative impact on astronomy observations, the study noted.\n\n\"I see it as a tradeoff in parameters rather than an absolute better/worse kind of situation,\" John Barentine, a principal consultant at Arizona-based Dark Sky Consulting who was not involved with the new study, told Space.com.\n\nBarentine suspects that radio emissions beamed by the DTCs' antennas may be interfering with radio bands protected for astronomy, as the satellites communicate with Earth via radio signals but don't have a dedicated spectrum to do so.\n\nWhile scientists agree that providing connectivity to remote regions in the world is a worthy goal, the speed at which satellites are being launched to orbit worries many of them -- and not just because of their image-scarring brightness. Over a million satellites may soon enter a space around Earth already crowded with thousands of derelict spacecraft, spent rocket bodies and millions of millimeter-sized pieces of junk that zip above us at high speeds. This debris population poses a threat to satellites that provide internet service, navigation and weather monitoring, and sometimes even to astronauts onboard the International Space Station.\n\nRelated: Astronomers urged to fight 'tooth and nail' to protect dark skies\n\nEven if we can dodge a disaster in orbit by responsibly de-orbiting derelict satellites, many scientists are concerned that the number of objects circling our planet could still do harm: When they deorbit, they could deposit a significant flux of metals that could alter the chemical makeup of Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"Effects on astronomy are just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Barentine, who says we may be fast approaching a turning point where tragedy becomes imminent, either in space due to a collision or on the ground from falling debris. \"Space policy-making moves far too slowly to effectively deal with all of this.\"\n\n\"Right now, there's not a lot to look forward to that is positive,\" he added. \"If the New Space Age goes badly in the end, history will not look favorably on it.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharmila_kuthunur@space.com", "name": "Sharmila Kuthunur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luminosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite internet constellation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Astronomical Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic interference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oBGAJ6hWHweWKMA6gCApdk-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786735", "eventUri": "eng-9786735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

And why wouldn't I? In addition to being PCMag's Starlink tester/guinea pig, I've also been a very happy customer of the service. I was eager to see how the improved dish design and Wi-Fi 6 router enhanced an already-great experience.\n\nMy first impressions were very good. And now, after several weeks of use and testing, I can confidently say that Starlink is, once again, better than ever. The new residential equipment pairs with updated satellite hardware and a growing number of terrestrial gateways to make Starlink bigger, better, and faster. We don't typically test Wi-Fi routers that only work with one ISP, but the Dish V4/Router Gen 3 combo is innovative enough to warrant a close look and easily deserving of an Editors' Choice award.\n\nWhat Is Starlink?\n\nStarlink is the satellite internet service from Elon Musk's company SpaceX. It offers broadband internet service almost anywhere that has a clear view of the sky, making fast, reliable access available in remote areas that may never get access to traditional services like cable or fiber. By using a satellite link and a specially designed, fairly portable dish to give users a wireless connection to the larger web, it allows speedy internet for things like streaming, gaming, and video calling.\n\nHow does Starlink extend speedy internet access to remote locations? Instead of running physical cables that connect your home or RV to the greater internet, Starlink uses a series of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that communicate between your home dish and a base station somewhere else on Earth that connects to the greater internet.\n\nBy removing the need for cable or fiber-optic connectivity in that last mile, Starlink is able to serve up decent internet speeds to anyone with a dish and a Starlink subscription, whether they're on a farm, on a mountain, or simply on the road too often to warrant a traditional stationary internet connection. As of this writing, SpaceX has 6,146 active Starlink satellites in orbit. The sheer number of satellites allows Starlink to serve more than three million customers worldwide.\n\nThe Latest Starlink Gear: Dish V4 and Router Gen 3\n\nObviously, that process requires a lot of equipment behind the scenes besides the satellites themselves, but for residential users, it's surprisingly simple. All you need is a Starlink dish, a router, and the electricity to power them. (That last part may sound obvious, but enough potential Starlink users want to go off the grid or use it for their van or camper that it's worth pointing out.)\n\nGetting that equipment used to be a hassle, requiring ordering directly from Starlink and potentially getting put on a waitlist if you were in the wrong part of the country. But these days, it's super easy, with Starlink gear for sale at Best Buy, Home Depot, Target, and other retailers. (Check out our guide on the best places to buy Starlink.)\n\nStarlink has used a couple of different dishes and routers in the past. In January, the company introduced the newest standard versions: Dish V4 and Router Gen 3, which boast better specs and better durability. In conjunction with upgraded satellites overhead, they also promise better performance. This new equipment can be purchased together in the Starlink Standard Installation Kit, with cable and power supply included, for $500. That's a big up-front cost, but it's not much more than what you'd spend on a midrange Wi-Fi router and a cable modem, which each cost around $200. It's also a full $100 less than the previous installation kit sold for. In some areas of the US where Starlink has extra capacity, the company also offers significant discounts.\n\nThe new dish has a larger antenna surface but a slimmer, more compact design that's more durable and more wind-resistant. Here's how the old and new dishes stack up in terms of physical specs and technology:\n\nThe router is also improved, with a new look, additional ports, and the addition of Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The result is faster speeds, better coverage in your home, and even easier integration with existing network hardware, whether it's a mesh network or a wired connection for a printer or network-attached storage (NAS) device.\n\nThe biggest improvement to the new router is the move to Wi-Fi 6, which is faster and farther-reaching than the previous Wi-Fi 5 router that came with the older dish. But it's hardly the only improvement. The router also upgrades from dual-band to tri-band support, with an improved 4x4 MU-MIMO setup that can handle up to 235 simultaneous devices on the network. The maximum Wi-Fi range has grown from 2,000 square feet to 3,200 square feet, and if that extended range and better connectivity aren't enough, it also supports adding up to three mesh nodes for whole-house coverage.\n\nThe full glory of Wi-Fi 6's 11Gbps theoretical maximum speed may not be readily apparent, given that Starlink promises only 200Mbps download speeds. Still, you will get better speeds between devices on the network, whether you're casting video to your smart TV or grabbing files from a home NAS device.\n\nThe re-introduction of two Ethernet ports on the router further enhances connectivity. If you look closely, you'll see some interesting hidden messages in your router port sockets, with etched text and images saying \"To Mars and beyond,\" \"Made on Earth by humans,\" and a stylized image of a SpaceX rocket launch. Say what you will about Elon Musk and his goal to colonize Mars using SpaceX tech, but you can't deny that the Starlink division of the company has made for a surprisingly great internet service for us Earth-bound customers.\n\nThe new router is also more compact, thanks to a redesigned external power supply, which used to be integrated into the router itself. Here's the full breakdown of the spec improvements:\n\nYou can also check out our first tests of the Dish V4 and Router Gen 3 for a different look at the improved designs and enhanced specs.\n\nStarlink also has several new accessories to accompany the redesigned dish, like the pole mount I used to attach my dish to an old mast that was left over from the previous homeowner's satellite TV dish.\n\nInstallation is easier, too, especially for those in RVs and vans, who will appreciate the dish's integrated kickstand. Starlink's instructions are direct and to the point: Plug in the dish and point it at the sky, so most users will assume they can handle the installation themselves. In most cases, there will be a couple more steps, though, like climbing on a roof or running cable through an exterior wall. If that sounds prohibitive, Starlink contracts with installers nationwide, who will install your dish and router for a nominal fee ($199). Self-installation is still free.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed much since our first review of the service is the Starlink app, which serves as your main interface to check your connection status, adjust settings, and access your Starlink account. It's essential when setting up your dish, as well as for monitoring network performance in day-to-day use. (Check out our guide to how to use the Starlink app).\n\nStarlink's 2024 Service Plans\n\nAside from the one-time purchase of the dish and installation equipment, Starlink does require a service plan, which costs $120 per month for the standard residential service. For that monthly fee, you'll get speedy internet that easily outperforms local DSL and other satellite ISP competitors, providing internet speeds that are fast enough for streaming media, playing online games, and joining in on video calls -- all the niceties of modern life that high-speed internet provides. And it comes with no data cap.\n\nIf you're in need of something more robust, such as providing internet for a whole business, using the dish on the go, or even using it for internet connectivity on a boat in the ocean, the company offers specific plans tailored to those use cases, which have a higher per-month cost and sometimes require pricier hardware. For the vast majority of residential users, however, the standard residential plan is perfect.\n\nTesting the Dish V4 and Router Gen 3: Boosted Performance\n\nFor previous Starlink testing, I've gathered data across a 14-day period. Two weeks of speed and latency data have proved more than enough to evaluate the overall performance of Starlink, which we tested in 2022, 2023, and earlier this year. But this time around, I collected more, stretching the test period to 20 days.\n\nThe reason for this is pretty simple. Starlink changed my default gateway from Denver to Salt Lake City. Was this a result of my complaints about wonky geolocation? Possibly. Or is it just the consequence of SpaceX's ongoing efforts to service more customers and reduce latency across the Starlink system? That sounds a lot more likely.\n\nIn any event, this gateway shuffle did have a noticeable and positive impact on download and upload speeds, as well as latency, giving the test location an additional boost in performance.\n\nMean download speeds sit right around a healthy 150Mbps. That's significantly faster than we saw with the older Starlink V2 hardware earlier this year, which averaged 113Mbps and resulted in better performance for a wide range of uses. For daily work, including Zoom calls, it was smoother than ever, and it even offered better streaming and gaming performance during my off hours.\n\nThe top download speed climbed to 325Mbps, though the average top speed was closer to 255Mbps. Given that the top speed we'd seen in prior testing was 265Mbps, that's a massive improvement, especially in day-to-day performance.\n\nLow speeds also improved, averaging 47Mbps. But what was most notable was a change on day 10 of testing, when Starlink changed my default gateway from Denver to Salt Lake City. The average coming out of Denver was 29.43Mbps, but out of Salt Lake, the lows averaged 66Mbps.\n\nMeasuring download and upload speeds is just part of the evaluation process. Why? Because those peak and average speeds only matter if they're the speeds you're actually experiencing, and if that performance is stable. Nobody cares how fast your internet registers in tests if your video feed keeps freezing up during work meetings.\n\nTo gauge consistency, we map out how many of our hundreds of test results fell within a 10Mbps range, letting us see how regularly the performance delivers those speeds. In download and upload speed testing, we measure by Mbps, and we map out the result in 10Mbps increments. For latency (aka ping response times), we measure in milliseconds (ms), again in intervals of 10. Higher numbers are better for uploads and downloads, while lower numbers are better for latency.\n\nWhere download speeds had previously clustered around the 70Mbps-to-110Mbps range earlier this year, we now see a grouping in the much higher 150Mbps-to-180Mbps range, indicating performance that's not just occasionally faster but consistently faster.\n\nUpload speeds similarly clustered in the 10Mbps-to-20Mbps and 20Mbps-to-30Mbps ranges, notably faster than previous tests using the older Dish V2.\n\nIn latency and ping testing, where we run thousands of tests rather than merely hundreds, we saw more results in the 20ms-to-30ms range than any other by an order of magnitude. That's actually slightly slower than what we saw last spring, but we also have a larger data set, and the average latency still dropped from 38ms to 29ms using the new hardware.\n\nBreaking out the ping results by server -- we test using both Cloudflare and Google -- we saw an interesting result:\n\nOn Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1, the latency stayed under 30ms most of the time, with a fairly predictable sloping curve for results at higher latency. But the results from Google's 8.8.8.8 server were different. We had a cluster of results in the 0-to-30ms range and another cluster in the slower 60-to-90ms range. This may have been caused by the gateway switch or some other factor we aren't aware of. In any case, the average latency was still very low most of the time.\n\nFinally, when comparing raw averages across our annual Starlink tests, we saw that the latest Starlink V4 tests were consistently better than years past and even better than our 2024 tests, which were conducted in January on the older V2 dish and Gen 2 Router.\n\nDownload speeds jumped to their highest yet, averaging 148.39Mbps across all the testing with the V4 hardware.\n\nUpload speeds were also the highest we've seen from the service, at 23.21Mbps. Upload speeds are always a fraction of download speeds (with the exception of some fiber-based ISPs), but we've seen upload speeds more than double since we started testing in 2022.\n\nFinally, latency was the lowest we've ever seen, down to 28.99ms on average. Given that Starlink requires blasting your internet activity to space and back, the latency has always been impressively low, but this is dramatically better than what we've seen before. It appears that SpaceX's investment in improving every link in the Starlink chain, from ground stations to the satellites in space, has paid off.\n\nThe above tests factor in the performance of the Dish V4 and Router Gen 3 together. We aren't able to isolate the router's performance in order to compare it with other routers using our standard test criteria since we don't have Starlink service at the New York location we use for router testing. If you're happy with the performance of your existing router or mesh system or are interested in buying a third-party one, it's easy enough to use your own router with Starlink.\n\nVerdict: The Best Satellite Internet Hardware\n\nEven as Starlink has gained a huge number of customers, the satellite internet company has done more than ever to increase its availability, improve performance across the board, and drive down latency across the network of terrestrial base stations and LEO satellites. From improved system infrastructure like next-gen satellites and a growing number of terrestrial gateways, to the sleeker, faster, and more durable dishes and routers, it's a big win, both for Starlink, and for Starlink customers.\n\nI've made no secret that I'm a fan of Starlink internet as both a reviewer and a customer, and the test numbers show why: It keeps improving. For a system that's bringing high-speed connectivity to underserved people around the globe, it would be easy for a company to say that good enough is good enough, but SpaceX has continued to invest in Starlink's development, making it better now than it's ever been.", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_westover@pcmag.com",

And why wouldn't I? In addition to being PCMag's Starlink tester/guinea pig, I've also been a very happy customer of the service. I was eager to see how the improved dish design and Wi-Fi 6 router enhanced an already-great experience.\n\nMy first impressions were very good. And now, after several weeks of use and testing, I can confidently say that Starlink is, once again, better than ever. The new residential equipment pairs with updated satellite hardware and a growing number of terrestrial gateways to make Starlink bigger, better, and faster. We don't typically test Wi-Fi routers that only work with one ISP, but the Dish V4/Router Gen 3 combo is innovative enough to warrant a close look and easily deserving of an Editors' Choice award.\n\nStarlink is the satellite internet service from Elon Musk's company SpaceX. It offers broadband internet service almost anywhere that has a clear view of the sky, making fast, reliable access available in remote areas that may never get access to traditional services like cable or fiber. By using a satellite link and a specially designed, fairly portable dish to give users a wireless connection to the larger web, it allows speedy internet for things like streaming, gaming, and video calling.\n\nHow does Starlink extend speedy internet access to remote locations? Instead of running physical cables that connect your home or RV to the greater internet, Starlink uses a series of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that communicate between your home dish and a base station somewhere else on Earth that connects to the greater internet.\n\nBy removing the need for cable or fiber-optic connectivity in that last mile, Starlink is able to serve up decent internet speeds to anyone with a dish and a Starlink subscription, whether they're on a farm, on a mountain, or simply on the road too often to warrant a traditional stationary internet connection. As of this writing, SpaceX has 6,146 active Starlink satellites in orbit. The sheer number of satellites allows Starlink to serve more than three million customers worldwide.\n\nObviously, that process requires a lot of equipment behind the scenes besides the satellites themselves, but for residential users, it's surprisingly simple. All you need is a Starlink dish, a router, and the electricity to power them. (That last part may sound obvious, but enough potential Starlink users want to go off the grid or use it for their van or camper that it's worth pointing out.)\n\nGetting that equipment used to be a hassle, requiring ordering directly from Starlink and potentially getting put on a waitlist if you were in the wrong part of the country. But these days, it's super easy, with Starlink gear for sale at Best Buy, Home Depot, Target, and other retailers. (Check out our guide on the best places to buy Starlink.)\n\nStarlink has used a couple of different dishes and routers in the past. In January, the company introduced the newest standard versions: Dish V4 and Router Gen 3, which boast better specs and better durability. In conjunction with upgraded satellites overhead, they also promise better performance. This new equipment can be purchased together in the Starlink Standard Installation Kit, with cable and power supply included, for $500. That's a big up-front cost, but it's not much more than what you'd spend on a midrange Wi-Fi router and a cable modem, which each cost around $200. It's also a full $100 less than the previous installation kit sold for. In some areas of the US where Starlink has extra capacity, the company also offers significant discounts.\n\nThe new dish has a larger antenna surface but a slimmer, more compact design that's more durable and more wind-resistant. Here's how the old and new dishes stack up in terms of physical specs and technology:\n\nThe router is also improved, with a new look, additional ports, and the addition of Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The result is faster speeds, better coverage in your home, and even easier integration with existing network hardware, whether it's a mesh network or a wired connection for a printer or network-attached storage (NAS) device.\n\nThe biggest improvement to the new router is the move to Wi-Fi 6, which is faster and farther-reaching than the previous Wi-Fi 5 router that came with the older dish. But it's hardly the only improvement. The router also upgrades from dual-band to tri-band support, with an improved 4x4 MU-MIMO setup that can handle up to 235 simultaneous devices on the network. The maximum Wi-Fi range has grown from 2,000 square feet to 3,200 square feet, and if that extended range and better connectivity aren't enough, it also supports adding up to three mesh nodes for whole-house coverage.\n\nThe full glory of Wi-Fi 6's 11Gbps theoretical maximum speed may not be readily apparent, given that Starlink promises only 200Mbps download speeds. Still, you will get better speeds between devices on the network, whether you're casting video to your smart TV or grabbing files from a home NAS device.\n\nThe re-introduction of two Ethernet ports on the router further enhances connectivity. If you look closely, you'll see some interesting hidden messages in your router port sockets, with etched text and images saying \"To Mars and beyond,\" \"Made on Earth by humans,\" and a stylized image of a SpaceX rocket launch. Say what you will about Elon Musk and his goal to colonize Mars using SpaceX tech, but you can't deny that the Starlink division of the company has made for a surprisingly great internet service for us Earth-bound customers.\n\nThe new router is also more compact, thanks to a redesigned external power supply, which used to be integrated into the router itself. Here's the full breakdown of the spec improvements:\n\nYou can also check out our first tests of the Dish V4 and Router Gen 3 for a different look at the improved designs and enhanced specs.\n\nStarlink also has several new accessories to accompany the redesigned dish, like the pole mount I used to attach my dish to an old mast that was left over from the previous homeowner's satellite TV dish.\n\nInstallation is easier, too, especially for those in RVs and vans, who will appreciate the dish's integrated kickstand. Starlink's instructions are direct and to the point: Plug in the dish and point it at the sky, so most users will assume they can handle the installation themselves. In most cases, there will be a couple more steps, though, like climbing on a roof or running cable through an exterior wall. If that sounds prohibitive, Starlink contracts with installers nationwide, who will install your dish and router for a nominal fee ($199). Self-installation is still free.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed much since our first review of the service is the Starlink app, which serves as your main interface to check your connection status, adjust settings, and access your Starlink account. It's essential when setting up your dish, as well as for monitoring network performance in day-to-day use. (Check out our guide to how to use the Starlink app).\n\nAside from the one-time purchase of the dish and installation equipment, Starlink does require a service plan, which costs $120 per month for the standard residential service. For that monthly fee, you'll get speedy internet that easily outperforms local DSL and other satellite ISP competitors, providing internet speeds that are fast enough for streaming media, playing online games, and joining in on video calls -- all the niceties of modern life that high-speed internet provides. And it comes with no data cap.\n\nIf you're in need of something more robust, such as providing internet for a whole business, using the dish on the go, or even using it for internet connectivity on a boat in the ocean, the company offers specific plans tailored to those use cases, which have a higher per-month cost and sometimes require pricier hardware. For the vast majority of residential users, however, the standard residential plan is perfect.\n\nFor previous Starlink testing, I've gathered data across a 14-day period. Two weeks of speed and latency data have proved more than enough to evaluate the overall performance of Starlink, which we tested in 2022, 2023, and earlier this year. But this time around, I collected more, stretching the test period to 20 days.\n\nThe reason for this is pretty simple. Starlink changed my default gateway from Denver to Salt Lake City. Was this a result of my complaints about wonky geolocation? Possibly. Or is it just the consequence of SpaceX's ongoing efforts to service more customers and reduce latency across the Starlink system? That sounds a lot more likely.\n\nIn any event, this gateway shuffle did have a noticeable and positive impact on download and upload speeds, as well as latency, giving the test location an additional boost in performance.\n\nMean download speeds sit right around a healthy 150Mbps. That's significantly faster than we saw with the older Starlink V2 hardware earlier this year, which averaged 113Mbps and resulted in better performance for a wide range of uses. For daily work, including Zoom calls, it was smoother than ever, and it even offered better streaming and gaming performance during my off hours.\n\nThe top download speed climbed to 325Mbps, though the average top speed was closer to 255Mbps. Given that the top speed we'd seen in prior testing was 265Mbps, that's a massive improvement, especially in day-to-day performance.\n\nLow speeds also improved, averaging 47Mbps. But what was most notable was a change on day 10 of testing, when Starlink changed my default gateway from Denver to Salt Lake City. The average coming out of Denver was 29.43Mbps, but out of Salt Lake, the lows averaged 66Mbps.\n\nMeasuring download and upload speeds is just part of the evaluation process. Why? Because those peak and average speeds only matter if they're the speeds you're actually experiencing, and if that performance is stable. Nobody cares how fast your internet registers in tests if your video feed keeps freezing up during work meetings.\n\nTo gauge consistency, we map out how many of our hundreds of test results fell within a 10Mbps range, letting us see how regularly the performance delivers those speeds. In download and upload speed testing, we measure by Mbps, and we map out the result in 10Mbps increments. For latency (aka ping response times), we measure in milliseconds (ms), again in intervals of 10. Higher numbers are better for uploads and downloads, while lower numbers are better for latency.\n\nWhere download speeds had previously clustered around the 70Mbps-to-110Mbps range earlier this year, we now see a grouping in the much higher 150Mbps-to-180Mbps range, indicating performance that's not just occasionally faster but consistently faster.\n\nUpload speeds similarly clustered in the 10Mbps-to-20Mbps and 20Mbps-to-30Mbps ranges, notably faster than previous tests using the older Dish V2.\n\nIn latency and ping testing, where we run thousands of tests rather than merely hundreds, we saw more results in the 20ms-to-30ms range than any other by an order of magnitude. That's actually slightly slower than what we saw last spring, but we also have a larger data set, and the average latency still dropped from 38ms to 29ms using the new hardware.\n\nBreaking out the ping results by server -- we test using both Cloudflare and Google -- we saw an interesting result:\n\nOn Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1, the latency stayed under 30ms most of the time, with a fairly predictable sloping curve for results at higher latency. But the results from Google's 8.8.8.8 server were different. We had a cluster of results in the 0-to-30ms range and another cluster in the slower 60-to-90ms range. This may have been caused by the gateway switch or some other factor we aren't aware of. In any case, the average latency was still very low most of the time.\n\nFinally, when comparing raw averages across our annual Starlink tests, we saw that the latest Starlink V4 tests were consistently better than years past and even better than our 2024 tests, which were conducted in January on the older V2 dish and Gen 2 Router.\n\nDownload speeds jumped to their highest yet, averaging 148.39Mbps across all the testing with the V4 hardware.\n\nUpload speeds were also the highest we've seen from the service, at 23.21Mbps. Upload speeds are always a fraction of download speeds (with the exception of some fiber-based ISPs), but we've seen upload speeds more than double since we started testing in 2022.\n\nFinally, latency was the lowest we've ever seen, down to 28.99ms on average. Given that Starlink requires blasting your internet activity to space and back, the latency has always been impressively low, but this is dramatically better than what we've seen before. It appears that SpaceX's investment in improving every link in the Starlink chain, from ground stations to the satellites in space, has paid off.\n\nThe above tests factor in the performance of the Dish V4 and Router Gen 3 together. We aren't able to isolate the router's performance in order to compare it with other routers using our standard test criteria since we don't have Starlink service at the New York location we use for router testing. If you're happy with the performance of your existing router or mesh system or are interested in buying a third-party one, it's easy enough to use your own router with Starlink.\n\nEven as Starlink has gained a huge number of customers, the satellite internet company has done more than ever to increase its availability, improve performance across the board, and drive down latency across the network of terrestrial base stations and LEO satellites. From improved system infrastructure like next-gen satellites and a growing number of terrestrial gateways, to the sleeker, faster, and more durable dishes and routers, it's a big win, both for Starlink, and for Starlink customers.\n\nI've made no secret that I'm a fan of Starlink internet as both a reviewer and a customer, and the test numbers show why: It keeps improving. For a system that's bringing high-speed connectivity to underserved people around the globe, it would be easy for a company to say that good enough is good enough, but SpaceX has continued to invest in Starlink's development, making it better now than it's ever been.", "source": {"uri": "uk.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCMag UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

All subscriptions will be invoiced on the same day each month, as stated on the support page.\n\nSpaceX's family package only enables one additional subscriber, in contrast to Netflix, which allows up to two additional users. A continuing membership to a full-price service plan is necessary in order to be eligible for the discounted service plan. The family plan discount will be immediately terminated upon cancellation of the full-price plan.\n\nFor homes with several devices that require internet access, Starlink is the best option. It provides a no-contract option that lets customers stop using the service whenever they want without incurring fees. Furthermore, if the service is cancelled within 30 days and the equipment is returned in excellent condition with its original packaging, the equipment fees are refundable.\n\nCost of Starlink subscription\n\nTo increase sales, SpaceX has been proactive in providing a range of discounts on Starlink hardware. The V4 standard Starlink dish was originally $499, however as of late, certain U.S. consumers can purchase it for $199, $249, or $299. The family plan is a big step forward, indicating an uncommon reduction in Starlink's regular monthly charge of $120 for residential customers.\n\nWhere are Starlink services available?\n\nThe contiguous 48 states are covered by Starlink services, with the majority of coverage found in urban areas. Many regions are still waiting, even though Starlink's map allows you to check the exact availability.\n\nAlso Read: | Nasa curiosity rover uncovers potential evidence of ancient life on Mars with discovery of Chevaya Falls rock\n\nThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Is It Time to IPO?", "body": "SpaceX is raising prices, and not just on its space rockets -- but on Starlink satellite internet service, too.\n\nA review of changes to SpaceX's website shows that sometime between May 6 and June 7 of this year, SpaceX raised the price on Falcon 9 rocket rides from $67 million to $69.75 million, a 4.1% increase. At about the same time, subscribers to the company's Starlink broadband internet service noticed some even more significant hikes in the prices they were being asked to pay.\n\nBeginning with the biggest number, CNET reported in late May that Starlink will hike prices 100% on its Mobile Global service tier. This tier, popular with boat owners, digital nomads, and globetrotters in general, used to buy a user unlimited access to Starlink satellites from any location on Earth for $200 a month. But as Starlink began warning users in May, Mobile Global prices will double to $400 a month beginning on Aug. 26.\n\nWhy the change? As far back as 2022, Elon Musk warned Starlink customers that Starlink capacity is not infinite, and too many users would overwhelm the network:\n\nThese capacity limitations may be beginning to bite, forcing Starlink to choose between throttling internet speeds on heavy users, or limiting traffic in a more roundabout way -- by raising prices to scare off some subscribers. In fact, Starlink may be adopting a both-and approach, raising prices on Mobile Global and at the same time nudging mobile users into a cheaper, more limited plan it calls Mobile Priority.\n\nAccording to Starlink's service plans page, the lowest tier of Mobile Priority costs more than Mobile Global ($250 versus $200 a month), and also caps usage at 50 GB of traffic per month before transmission speeds start slowing down.\n\nFurther reinforcing the theory that this price increase aims to curtail heavy use of the service, Starlink no longer advertises the Mobile Global service tier on its website, and seems to be trying to phase it out.\n\nMost Starlink customers, of course, have little need to lug a Starlink antenna all around the world -- and little desire to pay $250 (much less $400) for broadband internet. Starlink's target audience, after all, is rural customers who want to replace slow, obsolete landline connections such as DSL with faster satellite internet at a reasonable price.\n\nBut depending on where they live, their prices may be going up as well.\n\nLast year, Starlink rejiggered its base Starlink price to give a temporary price break to such subscribers in areas with limited usage and therefore \"excess capacity.\" Instead of paying $110 a month, they'd pay just $90. Conversely, customers in areas with high usage resulting in \"limited capacity\" would pay a higher monthly cost -- $120.\n\nProblem is, as time goes by, areas with limited usage fill up with new users, reducing excess capacity and causing limited capacity. Want to guess what happens to rates then?\n\nThat's right. Users start paying full freight, and so their prices jump from $90 to $120 a month, a sudden 33% increase that apparently went live on June 10, according to an article in PC Magazine. Most likely, this will be a dynamic process going forward, too, with areas of limited usage and excess capacity gradually filling up, and users who have enjoyed a price break gradually getting hit with the full $120 cost of service.\n\nThat's bad news for Starlink customers, who may feel like they've been drawn in with a low introductory rate, only to get hit with a 33% rate hike. But it may be great news for would-be investors in a Starlink IPO.\n\nCEO Elon Musk is already on record saying he plans to IPO Starlink once its revenue growth is \"reasonably predictable.\"\n\nIndustry news site Payload says the SpaceX subsidiary is in fact already growing faster than SpaceX itself, with sales probably rising 62% this year, helping to generate $600 million in free cash flow (according to Quilty Analytics). And now SpaceX is demonstrating it has the pricing power to raise rates as much as 33% -- or even 100% -- basically at will?\n\nI don't know about you, but that sounds like some pretty predictable revenue growth to me.\n\nTo me, it sounds like SpaceX is getting ready to IPO Starlink.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \"Double Down\" stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nRight now, we're issuing \"Double Down\" alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nStarlink Hiked Prices.

Their arrangement ensures that imaging and observation tasks are carried out efficiently, covering more ground with fewer gaps.\n\nOptimization and Simulation for Precision\n\nTo achieve the most effective configuration, the researchers used advanced algorithms to optimize the orbits. This involved a detailed iterative process to minimize differences in orbital nodes and maintain precise relative positions over time.\n\nNumerical simulations validated the method, using specific parameters such as an orbital inclination of 66 , zero eccentricity, and a regression coefficient of 15. The simulation demonstrated rapid convergence towards optimal configurations, ensuring stable and reliable satellite operations.\n\nImpressive Simulation Results\n\nThe simulation results were notable, with a final constellation consisting of 891 satellites. Of these, 81 basic satellites were each surrounded by 10 accompanying satellites, providing comprehensive coverage of areas outside the polar regions within a 35-minute timeframe.\n\nThe study confirms that this new design method for satellite mega constellations can significantly improve LEO observation capabilities, offering a robust and efficient solution for global satellite coverage.\n\nResearch Report:Configuration Design Method of Mega Constellation for Low Earth Orbit Observation", "source": {"uri": "spacedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbital plane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbital node"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ellipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital eccentricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital inclination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constellation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/china-constellation-ellipspace-starpool-satellite-prototypes-hg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786735", "eventUri": "eng-9786735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

In June, it slashed the price of its satellite dish from $499 to $299 in 29 states with \"abundant network availability.\"\n\nFamily plans are a new phenomenon in the internet world -- you usually only see them with cellphone and streaming services. Starlink's family plan looks similar to Netflix's, which allows users to add an extra member to their account for a discounted rate of $8 a month. Reddit users who use Starlink on farms said the discount would be welcome news on their properties, which require multiple dishes.\n\n\"To maintain eligibility for a discounted service plan, you must continuously subscribe to a full-price service plan,\" the support page says. \"If you cancel the full-price service plan, the discount will be immediately removed from a family plan subscription.\"\n\nStarlink hasn't said how they will determine who is invited to participate in the family plan or when the invitations will go out.

We're already seeing encouraging results.\"\n\nIn contrast to a $5.6 million decrease in VSAT service revenues during the quarter, KVH recorded a $1.7 million rise in Starlink service sales after activating more than 1,000 terminals from SpaceX since the start of the year.\n\nKVH also recently laid off about 75 employees, or 20% of its workforce, as part of its cost-saving efforts.\n\nBuying from the competition\n\nIn June, KVH announced it had prepaid for access to a large block of Starlink data for over a year at favorable rates as part of a bulk distribution deal with the company.\n\nKVH paid around $17 million in the second quarter of 2024 for the NGSO capacity, which offers greater coverage and lower latency compared with services from geostationary orbit.\n\nVessels that choose KVH for Starlink services rather than directly going to SpaceX have access to more specialized customer and technical services.\n\nKVH also offers services for customers seeking to integrate Starlink with 5G networks and satellites in other orbits, although the company expects its VSAT sales to continue to decline.\n\nSubscribers to Starlink services via KVH roughly doubled between March 31 and June 30. KVH said Starlink is the fastest-growing service in the company's history.\n\nBruun said existing KVH customers on the lower end of the leisure market are typically swapping out their VSAT service for Starlink. Larger yachts and commercial vessels are adding Starlink alongside VSAT for greater redundancy and flexibility.\n\nThe average revenue per user KVH gets from a standalone Starlink service \"tends to be a little bit lower than what we experienced from a VSAT-standalone,\" he added, while ARPU from a combined offering is \"actually a bit more than what we've seen historically.\"\n\nBruun also said vessels previously not signed up for VSAT communications are increasingly coming into its field of view with Starlink.\n\n\"Starlink is opening up a larger market,\" he said, across leisure and light commercial markets such as fishing.\n\nHowever, Starlink remains a threat to the company's broader business.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, one of KVH's largest customers, is transferring its primary satellite service relationship to Starlink. KVH expects revenues will start declining from this customer from the third or fourth quarter of 2024 and continue into 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Bruun said KVH is testing OneWeb's NGSO constellation as part of efforts to future-proof its offering, and services are slated to come online in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "spacenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_rainbow@spacenews.com", "name": "Jason Rainbow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communications satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-small-aperture_terminal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Very-small-aperture terminal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geostationary orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constellation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepay_mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prepay mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latency (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field of view"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Telemarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Telemarketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Freelancer-Contractor_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Freelancer-Contractor Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/US-coast-guard3-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786735", "eventUri": "eng-9786735", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-03-31", "dateEnd": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 2260, "textEnd": 2280}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 79, "relevance": 1}

Zee. \"We take pride in building cost-effective small satellites that outperform and often exceed operational specifications.\"\n\nAll nine GHGSat spacecraft developed by SFL are in excellent operational health. SFL developed the GHGSat-D (Claire) demonstration satellite for its launch in 2016 and was then selected to build the commercial GHGSat-C1 through C8 spacecraft launched since 2020. GHGSat-D has surpassed its design operational life by three years, and the eight commercial microsatellites achieved sustained detection and measurement of methane emissions on the ground at double their design capacities.\n\n\"As GHGSat continues to rapidly expand its constellation of high-resolution emissions-monitoring satellites, we are proud to once again partner with SFL for an additional two satellites. These spacecraft, which will build on the extensive track record of the previous nine SFL-built GHGSat satellites, mark exciting progress in GHGSat's mission to measure emissions at every industrial site, worldwide, every day. The insights they generate will enable tangible emissions reductions for GHGSat's government and industry customers, creating global climate impact,\" said GHGSat President St\u00e9phane Germain.\n\nDevelopment of GHGSat-C12 and C13 is underway at the SFL facility in Toronto. The two new satellites will be identical in design and technical capabilities to GHGSat-C6, C7, C8 that were launched in 2023.\n\nGHGSat originally chose SFL to develop the breakthrough Claire demonstration mission due in part to SFL's expertise in implementing advanced attitude control and stability technologies that enable smaller spacecraft to accurately point sensors at targets on the ground. Rare in satellites of that size and price point, this capability was crucial to GHGSat's mission objectives.\n\nIn addition.

This move is part of China's effort to develop its own network similar to SpaceX's Starlink network in the US.\n\nThe deployment of the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites was conducted by Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST) at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre in Shanxi province, northern China.\n\nThese satellites, launched via a Long March 6 rocket, are the inaugural group of SSST's \"Thousand Sails Constellation\" initiative, as reported by the media.\n\nThis government-supported initiative is China's response to Starlink, the expansive commercial broadband constellation by SpaceX that boasts approximately 5,500 LEO satellites, offering near-global internet coverage to consumers, businesses, and governmental bodies.\n\nStarlink is an affiliate of SpaceX, the aerospace company owned by American entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\nLEO satellites are typically positioned at altitudes ranging from 300 km to 2,000 km above the Earth's surface, providing the benefits of lower cost and more efficient transmission compared to higher-orbit satellites.\n\nThe strategic control of these satellites has considerable military significance.\n\nFollowing the Ukraine conflict in 2022, which highlighted Starlink's crucial role in military communications, outlets connected to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have released multiple editorials expressing concerns over the potential threat posed by Starlink to China's national interests.\n\nThese publications have characterized Starlink and SpaceX as elements of the \"space hegemony\" pursued by the United States, aiming to secure a \"unilateral space military advantage.\"", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri":

the chop too", "body": "Click here to follow Mail Sport's Euro 2024 WhatsApp Channel for all the latest breaking news and updates from Germany\n\nJames Maddison has left England's training camp, after it was revealed on Wednesday that the Tottenham midfielder would not be named in England's final Euro 2024 squad.\n\nGareth Southgate is set to name his final squad for this summer's tournament in Germany on Saturday and the Spurs star was widely viewed as one who was at risk of missing out on a call up, following a disappointing second half of the season.\n\nThe Spurs midfielder, who came on as a substitute against Bosnia on Monday night, will not be going to Germany after Southgate decided the former Leicester star would not make his 26-man party.\n\nIt is understood Maddison was in line to play in Friday's final warm-up fixture versus Iceland, but that will no longer be the case with Jarrod Bowen pushing to take his place in the team.\n\nEngland boss Southgate has to reduce his original 33-man squad by midnight on Friday and Maddison is a high-profile omission.\n\nTottenham's James Maddison has been left out of England's final 26-man squad for Euro 2024\n\nThe 27-year-old (left) was in line to play in Friday's final warm-up game against Iceland\n\nAs well as Maddison, six further players will have to be left out of England's final squad\n\nNews of Maddison's elimination comes after Southgate was handed good news on injury doubt Luke Shaw, who has stepped up his recovery from a hamstring injury to provide England with a key fitness boost.\n\nThe Manchester United full back has not played for three months but was still selected in the extended squad.\n\nHowever, there remains doubts over his availability for the tournament, given his injury problem and his long-term inactivity.\n\nBut Shaw has now taken a significant step forward in proving his fitness ahead of Southgate naming his final 26 man party for the tournament on Saturday.\n\nShaw has returned to training on the grass and while he isn't yet capable of completing full training sessions with the team, his inclusion, in parts, with his teammates' schedule provides an indicator that he is progressing well.\n\nIt seems likely that even if Shaw is deemed fit enough to make the final cut that his participation in England's group matches will be minimal.\n\nBut if Shaw is deemed fit to play a lead role in the knockout stages, then his presence would come as a huge boost for England given his position as the country's traditional first-choice left back.\n\nEngland face Iceland in their final warm-up game ahead of flying to Germany.\n\nLuke Shaw, who has been out with a hamstring injury, has given England a major fitness boost\n\nSouthgate has already left Marcus Rashford (left) and Jordan Henderson (right) out of his plans\n\nHarry Kane will return to the starting XI after starting Monday's win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on the bench, but Ivan Toney will have an opportunity to book his place in the final squad from the bench.\n\nManchester City and Manchester United contingent Phil Foden, Kyle Walker, Kobbie Mainoo and John Stones will be available after

Saturday.\n\nThe Tottenham midfielder was widely viewed as one of the players at risk of missing out following a largely disappointing second half of the season.\n\nAnd Maddison, who came on as a substitute against Bosnia on Monday night, will not be going to Germany after Gareth Southgate decided the former Leicester man would not make his 26-man party.\n\nIt is understood Maddison was in line to play in Friday's final warm-up fixture versus Iceland, but that will no longer be the case with Jarrod Bowen pushing to take his place in the team.\n\nEngland boss Southgate has to reduce his original 33-man squad by midnight on Friday and Maddison is a high-profile omission.\n\nTottenham's James Maddison has been left out of England's final 26-man squad for Euro 2024\n\nThe 27-year-old (left) was in line to play in Friday's final warm-up game against Iceland\n\nAs well as Maddison, six further players will have to be left out of England's final squad\n\nNews of Maddison's elimination comes after Southgate was handed good news on injury doubt Luke Shaw, who has stepped up his recovery from a hamstring injury to provide England with a key fitness boost.\n\nThe Manchester United full back has not played for three months but was still selected in the extended squad.\n\nHowever, there remains doubts over his availability for the tournament, given his injury problem and his long-term inactivity.\n\nBut Shaw has now taken a significant step forward in proving his fitness ahead of Southgate naming his final 26 man party for the tournament on Saturday.\n\nShaw has returned to training on the grass and while he isn't yet capable of completing full training sessions with the team, his inclusion, in parts, with his teammates' schedule provides an indicator that he is progressing well.\n\nIt seems likely that even if Shaw is deemed fit enough to make the final cut that his participation in England's group matches will be minimal.\n\nLuke Shaw, who has been out with a hamstring injury, has given England a major fitness boost\n\nSouthgate has already left Marcus Rashford (left) and Jordan Henderson (right) out of his plans\n\nBut if Shaw is deemed fit to play a lead role in the knockout stages, then his presence would come as a huge boost for England given his position as the country's first choice left back.\n\nEngland face Iceland in their final warm-up game ahead of flying to Germany.\n\nHarry Kane will return to the starting XI after starting Monday's win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on the bench, but Ivan Toney will have an opportunity to book his

There's still a bit to do before he can get on the pitch in a game situation.\n\n\"But really pleased with the work he's doing with our physical performance team and our medics, so, yeah, he's in with a good chance.\"\n\nWhen asked if Shaw could go to Euro 2024 even if he is not fully fit, Southgate said: \"That's the thing we have to work out.\n\n\"Because if he's not ready for the first couple of games there's a chance he could break down further down the line.\n\n\"You've got to make sure you've got enough cover in that situation as well, so there is a bit of a numbers game for us to play over the next few days.\n\n\"Clearly, he's a specialist left-back that's an incredibly high-level player as well, so you're more likely to take a chance on a player that's been a regular starter that

"title": "Curtis Jones joins James Maddison in being axed from England's Euros squad - and a Liverpool team-mate is set to follow - as Spurs star leaves Gareth Southgate's camp ALREADY", "body": "Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones will be among the players to miss out on the final England squad for Euro 2024.\n\nJones will join James Maddison who has also been told he won't make the final cut.\n\nThe Anfield star was handed his first call up when Gareth Southgate named his provisional 33-man party for the tournament last month.\n\nBut he will miss out on travelling to Germany, as will Tottenham midfielder Maddison, who was widely viewed as one of the players at risk of missing out following a largely disappointing second half of the season.\n\nIt is understood Maddison was in line to play in Friday's final warm-up fixture versus Iceland, but that will no longer be the case with Jarrod Bowen pushing to take his place in the team.\n\nLiverpool star Curtis Jones will miss out on England's final 26-man squad for Euro 2024\n\nJones was handed his first call up when Gareth Southgate named his provisional 33-man party\n\nSources indicate Maddison's decision to leave the squad on Wednesday is linked to Southgate's decision to leave him out of the final party.\n\nMaddison's omission has boosted Eberechi Eze and Jarrod Bowen's hopes of being involved in the final 26 man party.\n\nCrystal Palace attacker Eze was particularly impressive against Bosnia.\n\nElsewhere, Liverpool defender Jarell Quansah is also expected to drop out of the squad following his first call up.\n\nNews of Maddison and Jones' elimination comes after Southgate was handed good news on injury doubt Luke Shaw, who has stepped up his recovery from a hamstring injury to provide England with a key fitness boost.\n\nThe Manchester United full back has not played for three months but was still selected in the extended squad.\n\nHowever, there remains doubts over his availability for the tournament, given his injury problem and his long-term inactivity.\n\nBut Shaw has now taken a significant step forward in proving his fitness ahead of Southgate naming his final 26 man party for the tournament on Saturday.\n\nTottenham's James Maddison has also been left out of England's 26-man squad for Euro 2024\n\nJones' Liverpool team-mate, Jarell Quansah, is also expected to miss out on the final squad\n\nShaw has returned to training on the grass and while he isn't yet capable of completing full training sessions with the team, his inclusion, in parts, with his teammates' schedule provides an indicator that he is progressing well.\n\nIt seems likely that even if Shaw is deemed fit enough to make the final cut that his participation in England's group matches will be minimal.\n\nBut if Shaw is deemed fit to play a lead role in the knockout stages, then his presence would come as a huge boost for England given his position as the country's first choice left back.\n\nEngland face Iceland in their final warm-up game ahead of flying to Germany.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [],

It's not just getting the best individuals in, there's a positional element to that as well.\n\n\"We've got really good options and I think we've come through tonight without any physical issues, which is really important.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Luke Shaw has boosted his hopes of being included in England's final squad by stepping up his recovery from injury.\n\nManchester United left-back Shaw has returned to the grass and started training in part with the rest of the England squad this week.\n\nManager Gareth Southgate must submit his final 26-man squad to Uefa by midnight on Friday and Shaw will now be hopeful of making it.\n\nThe next step for the 28-year-old will be to reintegrate back into full team training, but his progress this week is viewed within the England camp as being significant.\n\nGiven Shaw has not played since February because of a hamstring injury, England will have to be careful with him.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Shaw returns to full training, Kieran Trippier is in line to start the Euros as England's stand-in left-back which will allow the Manchester United defender to be eased back in.\n\nShaw is the only natural left-back in Southgate's provisional 33-man squad.

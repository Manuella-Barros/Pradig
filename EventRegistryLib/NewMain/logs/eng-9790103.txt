As they crossed the finish line, he gave the victory to Kishane Thompson of Jamaica. However, after a few moments of further review, it was actually Noah Lyles of the United States who took the gold medal.\n\nTo be perfectly fair, Lyles and Thompson couldn't have been much closer. Lyles edged it out with a final time of 9.784 that was .005 better than Thompson at 9.789.\n\nTeam USA also took the bronze with Fred Kerley running a 9.81. Kenneth Bednarek then finished second from last at 9.88.\n\nThe other finishers are as follows with Akani Simbine of South Africa in fourth at 9.82, Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy in fifth at 9.85, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in sixth at 9.86, and another Jamaican in Oblique Seville being last at 9.91.\n\nThis was a major moment for the competitor and his country in this specific event. No American had won the 100m final since 2004 when Justin Gatlin did so in Athens. It was also the first gold medal and second total in the career of Lyles.\n\nThere's only shame in missing that call with how very close that it came down to being. It did admittedly take away some from the achievement, though, with it being Lyles who actually won it moments later.\n\nLyles celebrates 100-meter dash win: 'America, I told you I got this'\n\nNoah Lyles had a strong message for the United States after winning the Olympic gold medal at the 100-meter dash in Paris.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this,\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles crossed the finish line with a time of 9.79 in a photo finish to win track and field's biggest event in the Olympics. He beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson who also ran a time 9.79. His fellow American in Fred Kerley finished in third by posting a 9.81 time to earn the bronze medal.\n\nLyles is the first American track star to win the Olympic gold medal at the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin won gold at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. This is his second Olympic medal, claiming bronze in the 200-meter dash in the 2020 Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\nLyles entered the Paris Olympics as the reigning world champion in the 100 and 200.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_gillenwater@on3.com", "name": "Sam Gillenwater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/08/04152921/Untitled-design-30-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Back then, Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in 10.25 seconds in an era when timing didn't go down to the thousandths of a second.\n\nAccording to Omega, the official timekeeper of all Olympics events, at the 65.15-meter mark, Lyles hit his peak speed, and he was trailing at that point. That peak reached 43.6 km/h or 27.1 mph, and he maintained that rate the rest of the race.\n\n\"What's crazy is my [biomechanist] Ralph Mann, before I left for Paris, he's like, 'This is how close first and second is going to be away from each other,'\" Lyles said, holding his hand up with a narrow space between his index finger and thumb. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nLyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nIf Lyles makes the 200-meter finals Wednesday night, he'll have an opportunity to claim a second gold medal.\n\nLyles' only other Olympic medal is a bronze, which he earned in the 200 at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nSunday's 100-meter final included the defending Olympic gold medalist at the distance, Marcell Jacobs of Italy; Thompson, the Jamaican who entered with the world's fastest time this year (9.77); and two of Lyles' American teammates, Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley.\n\nKerley came in third, earning bronze in 9.81 seconds. Bednarek finished seventh, with a time of 9.88 seconds.\n\nThompson's time in the final was only 0.02 of a second slower than what he posted at Jamaican trials earlier this summer. That blistering 9.77-second showing seemed a clear indication he would end up on the podium in Paris.\n\n\"I'm going to be disappointed, but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" Thompson said. \"I just got to take it as what it is and just move forward from here.\"\n\nIt appeared Thompson was leading for much of the sprint, until Lyles bolted in across the final 10 meters. Even then, it seemed evident the race was heading toward a thrilling photo finish.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with my speed myself,\" Thompson said.\n\nDuring the semifinal round an hour and a half earlier, Team Jamaica appeared to put the rest of the runners on notice. Thompson's 9.80 semifinal sprint was the fastest of the round. Just behind him in a personal-record 9.81 seconds was fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville, who ran in a separate heat that included Lyles.\n\nSeville had history with Lyles, having faced him in the Bahamas in June. Seville won it, sneaking just past Lyles in 9.82 seconds. Lyles finished 0.03 of a second later.\n\n\"Going to Jamaica and getting beat by Oblique, and still saying I ran .85, and I'm still constantly moving forward and moving forward,\" Lyles said, \"I knew that when the time came for me to be able to say, 'This is the final, this is where I need to put it together,' I was going to do it.\"\n\nIt was after Lyles won the 100-meter world championship in Budapest, Hungary, last August when he began leaning into the \"world's fastest man\" nickname.\n\n\"Everybody knows that the title goes to the Olympic champion, and the world champion,\" Lyles said last week. \"Which, I am one of ... and soon to be another one of.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This narrow victory, achieved by just 0.005 seconds over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, confirmed his status.\n\nIn the postrace news conference, Lyles recounted the tense moments before the result was announced. \"We were waiting for the names to pop up, and I told Thompson, 'I think you got that one, big dawg!' But something told me to lean, so I did because it was that kind of race.\"\n\nThis final was the closest since at least the 1980 Moscow Olympics when Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly defeated Silvio Leonard in 10.25 seconds, an era before thousandths of a second timing.\n\nOmega, the official Olympic timekeeper, noted that Lyles hit his peak speed of 43.6 km/h (27.1 mph) at the 65.15-meter mark, trailing at that point but maintaining that speed through the finish.\n\nLyles' biomechanist Ralph Mann had predicted the narrow margin between first and second. \"Before I left for Paris, he showed me how close it would be,\" Lyles said, illustrating a small gap with his fingers. \"I can't believe how accurate he was.\"\n\nLyles is the first American to win the prestigious race since Justin Gatlin in 2004. He now has a chance for a second gold if he makes the 200-meter finals on Wednesday.\n\nLyles previously won a bronze in the 200 at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nSunday's final featured a stellar lineup, including defending Olympic gold medalist Marcell Jacobs of Italy, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson with the year's fastest time, and American teammates Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley.\n\nKerley took bronze with a time of 9.81 seconds, while Bednarek finished seventh at 9.88 seconds.\n\nThompson's time was just 0.02 seconds slower than his Jamaican trials performance, suggesting a strong podium finish. \"I'm disappointed but also super happy and grateful,\" Thompson said. \"I just have to take it as it is and move forward.\"\n\nThompson appeared to lead for most of the race until Lyles surged in the final 10 meters, pushing the race to a thrilling photo finish. \"I wasn't patient enough with my speed,\" Thompson admitted.\n\nIn the semifinals, Team Jamaica made a statement. Thompson's 9.80-second sprint was the fastest, with fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville just behind at 9.81 seconds. Seville had previously edged out Lyles in the Bahamas in June with a time of 9.82 seconds.\n\nReflecting on that loss, Lyles said, \"Going to Jamaica and getting beat by Oblique, I knew when it came time for the final, I was going to put it together.\"\n\nAfter winning the 100-meter world championship in Budapest last August, Lyles embraced the \"world's fastest man\" moniker. \"Everyone knows that title goes to the Olympic and world champion,\" Lyles said last week. \"I am one of those...and soon to be another.\"", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Lyles finished behind the pair, in 9.83.\n\nLyles, running third from the outside in Lane 7, was perhaps invisible to Thompson, running third from the inside in Lane 4, as Lyles leaned his head over the finish line for gold.\n\nAmerican Fred Kerley captured the bronze medal, running the final in 9.81 seconds. Team USA's Kenneth Bednarek finished seventh, in 9.88 seconds.\n\nThompson was competing in his first Olympic Games.

He was outspoken in his lust for gold in Paris, at one point comparing an NBA championship unfavorably to finishing first in a track and field event.\n\n\"You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head,\" Lyles said last year. \"World champion of what? The United States? Don't get me wrong, I love the U.S. at times, but that ain't the world. That is not the world. We are the world. We have almost every country out here thriving, putting on their flag to show they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA.\"\n\nLyles talked a big game. Sunday, he backed it up.\n\nHis 9.78-second time in Sunday's final was also a personal best, beating the mark he set last year in the World Athletics Championships in Budapest.

His mother's response to his victory made the moment even more memorable.\n\nAmid the ongoing celebrations and the lingering excitement among the spectators, Lyles made his way to his mother in the stands.

This victory adds to his Olympic medal collection, which includes a bronze in the 200 meters from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (held in 2021). Lyles entered the Paris Olympics as the reigning world champion in both the 100 and 200 meters.\n\nHe's also a six-time world champion gold medalist, but winning Sunday's Olympic gold in the 100 meters may be the highlight of his career so far.\n\nSouth Africa's Akani Simbine secured fourth place with a time of 9.82 seconds, while Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs came in fifth at 9.85 seconds.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo followed closely in sixth with a time of 9.86 seconds. Kenny Bednarek from the USA and Jamaica's Oblique Seville rounded out the field in seventh and eighth places, clocking times of 9.88 and 9.91 seconds, respectively.\n\nAccording to World Athletics, this race marked the first time in history that eight men have completed a wind-legal 100-meter race in under 10 seconds.\n\nIn the semifinals, Thompson and his Jamaican teammate Oblique Seville posted the fastest times in their heats, with Thompson finishing in 9.80 seconds and Seville in 9.81 seconds. Lyles came in third in his heat with a time of 9.83 seconds.\n\nNoah Lyles also aiming for 200m gold\n\nNoah Lyles will kick off his quest for the 200-meter gold on Monday with the first round of heats.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81 and defending champion Marcell Jacobs finished fifth.\n\nThis was the closest 100-meter since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when timing didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAnd 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\n___\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNoah Lyles finished behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the semifinal of the Olympic 100 meters Sunday but still advanced for a rematch in the gold-medal race later in the evening.\n\nSeville is now 2-0 this season against Lyles after finishing in 9.81 seconds, good for a .02-second margin over the American champion.\n\nSeville got off to a stronger start than Lyles, and the American made up ground over the last 40 meters but couldn't completely close the gap. Lyles also lost his opening-round heat -- to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe on Saturday. Hinchliffe finished third in the semifinal and did not advance.\n\nJoining Lyles in the eight-man final will be Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won his semifinal in 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in the three semifinal. Thompson also has the world's best time this year at 9.77; he and Seville are trying to put Jamaica back on top of the Olympic podium for the first time since Usain Bolt retired after the 2016 Games.\n\nDefending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy finished third in the second semifinal and advanced because his 9.92 was the best among sprinters who didn't automatically qualify by finishing in the top two in their heats.\n\nAlso in the final will be Americans Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and South Africa's Akani Simbine.\n\nOther gold medals on the line Sunday night at the Stade de France are in men's hammer throw and women's high jump, where Yaroslava Mahuchikh tries to bring Olympic gold to her war-torn home country of Ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nYes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The World's Fastest Man.\n\nJust not by very much.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nLyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn't work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.\n\n\"But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,\" he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nLyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track -- a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.\n\nThe mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite -- and then, only -- sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission -- the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.\n\nThe practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.\n\nBut when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year -- Thompson -- and another who had beaten him twice this year -- Jamaica's Oblique Seville -- he knew this would be no coronation.\n\nThompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.\n\n\"I thought 'Man, that's my thing, that's crazy,'\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles galloped and leapt about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nNow, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?\n\nCould it have been Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed?\n\nWas it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters over the first 60 meters -- a skill he's been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?\n\nThe answer: all that and more.\n\n\"Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.\n\n\"Seeing that name, I was like 'Oh my gosh, there it is!'\" Lyles said.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, in lane seven, wins the men's 100-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81 and defending champion Marcell Jacobs finished fifth.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNoah Lyles finished behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the semifinal of the Olympic 100 meters Sunday but still advanced for a rematch in the gold-medal race later in the evening.\n\nSeville is now 2-0 this season against Lyles after finishing in 9.81 seconds, good for a .02-second margin over the American champion.\n\nSeville got off to a stronger start than Lyles, and the American made up ground over the last 40 meters but couldn't completely close the gap. Lyles also lost his opening-round heat -- to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe on Saturday. Hinchliffe finished third in the semifinal and did not advance.\n\nJoining Lyles in the eight-man final will be Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won his semifinal in 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in the three semifinal. Thompson also has the world's best time this year at 9.77; he and Seville are trying to put Jamaica back on top of the Olympic podium for the first time since Usain Bolt retired after the 2016 Games.\n\nDefending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy finished third in the second semifinal and advanced because his 9.92 was the best among sprinters who didn't automatically qualify by finishing in the top two in their heats.\n\nAlso in the final will be Americans Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and South Africa's Akani Simbine.\n\nOther gold medals on the line Sunday night at the Stade de France are in men's hammer throw and women's high jump, where Yaroslava Mahuchikh tries to bring Olympic gold to her war-torn home country of Ukraine.\n\nAP Summer Olympics:

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nYes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The World's Fastest Man.\n\nJust not by very much.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nLyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn't work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.\n\n\"But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,\" he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nLyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track -- a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.\n\nThe mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite -- and then, only -- sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission -- the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.\n\nThe practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.\n\nBut when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year -- Thompson -- and another who had beaten him twice this year -- Jamaica's Oblique Seville -- he knew this would be no coronation.\n\nThompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.\n\n\"I thought 'Man, that's my thing, that's crazy,'\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles galloped and leapt about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nNow, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?\n\nCould it have been Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed?\n\nWas it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters over the first 60 meters -- a skill he's been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?\n\nThe answer: all that and more.\n\n\"Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.\n\n\"Seeing that name, I was like 'Oh my gosh, there it is!'\" Lyles said.", "source": {"uri": "wjla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJLA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

Bednarek finished seventh, with a time of 9.88 seconds.\n\nDuring the semifinal round an hour and a half earlier, Team Jamaica appeared to put the rest of the runners on notice. Thompson's 9.80 semifinal sprint was the fastest of the round. Just behind him in a personal-record 9.81 seconds, was fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville, who ran in a separate heat that included Lyles.\n\nSeville had history with Lyles, having faced him in the Bahamas in June.

Credit - Jean Catuffe -- Getty Images\n\nNoah Lyles and his long-time sports psychologist, Diana McNab, have been executing a pre-race routine all season long. Together, they come up with a sort of script, which lays out the psychological game plan on race day -- from what Lyles should think when he wakes up, when he arrives at the track, when he's warming up, when he's in the blocks, and so on. This mental script is meant to produce strong physical results.\n\nAs per their practice, McNab got on the phone with Lyles the night before his 100-m race in Paris, and rang her Zen chimes three times while Lyles did breathing exercise before visualizing each element of the script.\n\n\"Always Zen chimes!\" says McNab.\n\nThe plan paid off on Sunday night, when Lyles won the most incredible, dramatic, and contested 100-m final in Olympic history. In a photo finish, Lyles edged out Kishane Thompson of Jamaica by five-thousandths of a second on Sunday night at Stade de France.\n\nWhen Lyles woke up on Sunday, his first step was to \"imagine you are 12-15-old Noah - laughing, fun, fearless,\" according to the script that McNabb shared with TIME after the race. At the end of his warmup, he was to be as loose as a \"Raggedy Ann-Doll.\" When he entered the track, he needed to \"look around and take in the thousands of spectators and energy in the stadium\" -- something he could not do in Tokyo, where there were no fans and Lyles went home with a disappointing bronze medal in the 200 m. In the last 20-meters, he was to be \"flying down the track. No one can stop me. I am on fire. I have a God-given extra gear.\"\n\nAnd when he crosses the finish line, according to the script, he'll have a personal-best time, finish in first place, smile, and feel a sense of relief.\n\nCheck, check, check, check. The only thing missing, really, was the agonizing wait for Lyles, Thompson, and bronze-medalist Fred Kerley as the judges settled the photo finish. Then he could let out a cackle on the track, take his victory lap, and officially back up the brash words he had been saying all year: the 100 m was now his.\n\nLyles finished second in his semifinal heat Sunday, to Oblique Seville of Jamaica. Was Lyles not fast enough on this night, or was he just preserving some energy in the tank? \"I told him to try to win,\" said Lyles' coach, Lance Brauman. \"I thought, to be honest with you, Oblique ran a hell of a race.\"\n\nEven Lyles' mother, Keisha, was a bit anxious in the Stade de France stands. Seville and Thompson, who had already run the fastest time of the year going into the Olympics, were looking formidable. She called up Lyles' agent and shared her candid observation.\n\n\"This final,\" said Keisha, \"is going to be a b-tch.\"\n\nBetween the semi and the final, Brauman told Lyles to run more aggressively between 30 and 50 meters. He told him that the next time he saw Lyles, he'd be looking at the 100-m Olympic champion. Brauman told his charge that the showman shows up in the big moment. McNab and Lyles also spoke: she told him to loosen up and stop carrying tension in his body.\n\nDuring his track introduction for the final, Lyles triple-jumped -- plus two or three more hops -- about a quarter way down the track. He was the only finalist to do so: his walk-out was not at all subdued. Does Brauman worry that Lyles' showmanship would sap his energy or risk injury?\n\n\"I try not to watch, to be totally honest,\" says Brauman. \"He does what he does. If I got caught up in that I'd be a nervous wreck all the time.\"\n\nRead More: Noah Lyles Brings His Speed and Sizzle To The Olympics\n\nLyles' reaction time at the gun -- 0.178 seconds -- was tied for worst in the race. \"Dang, I'm amazing,\" said Lyles afterward. \"That's crazy. I thought I was a little better than that, but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\" While Thompson was three lanes over, Seville was running to Lyles' left, within his peripheral vision. \"I was very fortunate to have Oblique Seville right next to me,\" said Lyles. \"Because all throughout the year, I feel like he's been hitting that acceleration that I wasn't hitting. So I was like, the fact that he's here means I'm not gonna let him go.\" Seville finished in last place.\n\nAs Lyles' top-end speed kicked in, Brauman -- who was seated along the backstretch near the finish and didn't have a good view of the start -- started feeling hopeful. \"I felt really good when I saw where he was at 60,\" said Brauman. \"OK, we're in the mix.\" Lyles leaned at the finish, which he wasn't supposed to do, since that causes the slightest bit of deceleration that can cost a sprinter. \"I thought I leaned too early,\" said Lyles. But he got away with it. Barely. Like, really, really barely.\n\nAs the runners and 80,000 fans at Stade de France stared at the scoreboard, wondering who won, Lyles went up to Thompson. and told him he thought the title was his. \"Bro, I think you got that one big dog,\" Lyles told him. \"And then my name popped up. And I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.\"\n\nNBC put a microphone on Keisha. She screamed so loud, a producer told her she had to turn the volume on her headphones down.\n\nRead More: 6 Track-and-Field Rivalries to Watch at the Paris Olympics\n\nThe times that appeared on the board -- 9.79 seconds -- were the same for Lyles and Thompson. So why wasn't the race some sort of draw? Turns out, Lyles won his gold medal in 9.784 seconds. Thompson got his silver in 9.789 seconds.

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles has been claiming to be \"the fastest man alive\" since becoming the reigning world champion in the 100-meter race last year.\n\nAfter Sunday night's race, the American can now claim that title without contest.\n\nLyles ran 9.79 seconds, a personal best, in the Sunday night competition at Stade de France, to claim his first Olympic gold.\n\nAhead of start time, Lyles, known for his dramatics and showmanship, came onto the track with arms raised to whip up the crowd, finishing his pre-race show by darting up and down about a quarter of the 100-meter distance he was about to run.\n\nOnce the shot fired, the American got a classically sluggish start but accelerated enough to beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who -- before tonight -- was the fastest man this year. He also posted 9.79, prompting a nail-biting few moments as everyone in the stadium waited for the photo finish results to develop.\n\nComputers show Lyles leaned forward to cross the line five-thousandths of a second faster than Thompson.\n\nBefore the final results posted, Lyles told reporters he thought it was Thompson who finished first, not him.\n\n\"I was like, oh man I'm really gonna have to swallow my pride, which I don't have a problem doing. Respect deserves respect, and everybody in the field to be honest came out knowing that they could win this race.\"\n\nFred Kerley of the U.S. came in third place .02 seconds later to win bronze.\n\nLyles' victory in the 100m is the first U.S. gold in the Olympic event since Justin Gatlin won in 2004.\n\nAs for Thompson, he'll be the first Jamaican to make it to the podium since Usain Bolt's Olympic reign ended with the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.\n\n\"This is the closest medal,\" Thompson said after the race. \"I couldn't see him, but I thought he was seeing me. He said, 'Hey Kishane I thought you got it,' and I said, 'I am not sure.' \"\n\nIn the semifinal, fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville ran a personal best 9.81, finishing ahead of Lyles by .02 after the American had another rough start.\n\nLyles' celebrity rose after last month's release of the Netflix docuseries Sprint, which follows several of the fastest runners currently at the Paris Games in their quest for Olympic gold.\n\nLyles is the reigning world champion in the 100m and the 200m. It's also why the showman already liked to call himself the \"fastest man alive.\" He also won the bronze in the 200-meter race at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nUltimately, Lyles is chasing Bolt's world record in both. Bolt's 100-meter record is 9.58 seconds.\n\nLyles is not known for his start out of the blocks. In fact, an official timing analysis of the final showed that for the first 40 meters of Sunday's gold-medal race, he was in last place.\n\nIt's why the 200-meter is his better event. He'll have a chance to prove that on Thursday night.\n\nIf he does win, Lyles would be the first male sprinter to achieve the Olympic sprint double since Bolt did it at Rio in 2016.\n\nAt a post-race press conference, Lyles was asked to look in to the future.\n\nHe said sprinting greats should be seen at the same level as basketball superstars -- and have their own big sponsorships. He says that he even wants to have his own sneaker line.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/npr_story_images/2024/08/05/ap24217723641695.jpg?h=76d6f631&itok=nAl1FHjr", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In fact, the finish was so close that the official Olympic time for both Lyles and Thompson is the exact same at 9.79 seconds. The top four sprinters all had times within 0.03 seconds of each other.\n\nThe end of this race made for a fantastic photo finish, with all eight participants in the frame. In the image, you can Lyles leaning his head forward just enough to surpass Thompson and secure victory.\n\nEven in a slow-motion video of Lyles' finish, it's very hard to tell that he won. That's how close the race was. You can also see that Lyles wouldn't have secured any medal had it not been for his last-second effort.\n\nThis was just Lyles' second Olympic medal in his career. He won bronze in the 200m race at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nFans couldn't believe how close the race was when the slow-motion video surfaced online. They took to social media to leave their thoughts.\n\n\"The fact that Noah Lyles won this race is insane.. five one thousandths of a second!!!\"\n\n\"Probably one of the craziest finishes I ever seen\"\n\n\"What a finish\"\n\n\"This has to be one of the best final 10 meters ever ran in the Olympics, my lord\"\n\n\"Crazy\"\n\nIn the 100m semifinal, Lyles came in second place, right behind Jamaica runner Oblique Seville. He went viral for taunting Seville at the finish line but ultimately lost that race. In the end, it didn't matter because Lyles got the last laugh in the final.\n\nLyles grew up in Gainesville, Florida. He initially committed to compete for the Florida Gators but instead decided to go pro along with his brother Josephus Lyles.\n\nLyles will also compete in the men's 200m race. Round one will begin on Monday, August 5, at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nRelated: U.S. Sprinter Noah Lyles Loses Race After Taunting Opponent At Finish Line\n\nRelated: Olympic Runner Zablon Ekwam In Tears After Scary Moment During Race", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josephus Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Gators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1928, "textEnd": 1936}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Some former NBA players and gold medalists in their respective sports reacted to Lyles winning gold in Paris, and it was nothing but love from them.\n\nDwyane Wade was one of the first former NBA players to shout out Lyles but he did it by supporting his nail color. Wade has received backlash before for painting his nails, but it looks like Lyles does it too. At this point, there's not much you can say to Lyles since he's a gold medalist, and Wade seems to love it.\n\nMagic Johnson wasn't sitting on his couch like most people were watching the race, instead, he was on a yacht celebrating Lyles' win.\n\n\"It's the first time in 20 years that the US brings home the gold in the Men's 100! Wow - what an exciting race!! @LylesNoah,\" Johnson said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNoah Lyles wins his first gold medal\n\nNoah Lyles crossed the finish line in the 100 meters with a winning time of 9.79, and it was a perfect photo finish that showed the U.S. sprinter leaning his head forward to capture the gold. Kishane Thompson ran a 9.79 to finish in second place and Fred Kerley ran a 9.81 to finish in third place.\n\nLyles became the first American sprinter to win an Olympic gold medal in the men's 10 since Justin Gatlin at the 2004 Athens Games. Lyles knew how hard it would be, but he was ready for the test and came out victorious.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" Lyles said after the race. \"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nIn the first round of the 100 meters that took place on Aug. 3, Lyles finished second behind Great Britain's Louie Hinchcliffe. Despite second place, Lyles stayed confident.\n\n\"These boys said they ain't coming to play,\" Lyles said after the first round. \"And I guess that's my first lesson in underestimating the power of an Olympics.

Together, they come up with a sort of script, which lays out the psychological game plan on race day -- from what Lyles should think when he wakes up, when he arrives at the track, when he's warming up, when he's in the blocks, and so on. This mental script is meant to produce strong physical results.\n\nAs per their practice, McNab got on the phone with Lyles the night before his 100-m race in Paris, and rang her Zen chimes three times while Lyles did breathing exercise before visualizing each element of the script.\n\n\"Always Zen chimes!\" says McNab.\n\nThe plan paid off on Sunday night, when Lyles won the most incredible, dramatic, and contested 100-m final in Olympic history. In a photo finish, Lyles edged out Kishane Thompson of Jamaica by five-thousandths of a second on Sunday night at Stade de France.\n\nWhen Lyles woke up on Sunday, his first step was to \"imagine you are 12-15-old Noah - laughing, fun, fearless,\" according to the script that McNabb shared with TIME after the race. At the end of his warmup, he was to be as loose as a \"Raggedy Ann-Doll.\" When he entered the track, he needed to \"look around and take in the thousands of spectators and energy in the stadium\" -- something he could not do in Tokyo, where there were no fans and Lyles went home with a disappointing bronze medal in the 200 m. In the last 20-meters, he was to be \"flying down the track. No one can stop me. I am on fire. I have a God-given extra gear.\"\n\nAnd when he crosses the finish line, according to the script, he'll have a personal-best time, finish in first place, smile, and feel a sense of relief.\n\nCheck, check, check, check. The only thing missing, really, was the agonizing wait for Lyles, Thompson, and bronze-medalist Fred Kerley as the judges settled the photo finish. Then he could let out a cackle on the track, take his victory lap, and officially back up the brash words he had been saying all year: the 100 m was now his.\n\nLyles finished second in his semifinal heat Sunday, to Oblique Seville of Jamaica. Was Lyles not fast enough on this night, or was he just preserving some energy in the tank? \"I told him to try to win,\" said Lyles' coach, Lance Brauman. \"I thought, to be honest with you, Oblique ran a hell of a race.\"\n\nEven Lyles' mother, Keisha, was a bit anxious in the Stade de France stands. Seville and Thompson, who had already run the fastest time of the year going into the Olympics, were looking formidable. She called up Lyles' agent and shared her candid observation.\n\n\"This final,\" said Keisha, \"is going to be a b-tch.\"\n\nBetween the semi and the final, Brauman told Lyles to run more aggressively between 30 and 50 meters. He told him that the next time he saw Lyles, he'd be looking at the 100-m Olympic champion. Brauman told his charge that the showman shows up in the big moment. McNab and Lyles also spoke: she told him to loosen up and stop carrying tension in his body.\n\nDuring his track introduction for the final, Lyles triple-jumped -- plus two or three more hops -- about a quarter way down the track. He was the only finalist to do so: his walk-out was not at all subdued. Does Brauman worry that Lyles' showmanship would sap his energy or risk injury?\n\n\"I try not to watch, to be totally honest,\" says Brauman. \"He does what he does. If I got caught up in that I'd be a nervous wreck all the time.\"\n\nRead More: Noah Lyles Brings His Speed and Sizzle To The Olympics\n\nLyles' reaction time at the gun -- 0.178 seconds -- was tied for worst in the race. \"Dang, I'm amazing,\" said Lyles afterward. \"That's crazy. I thought I was a little better than that, but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\" While Thompson was three lanes over, Seville was running to Lyles' left, within his peripheral vision. \"I was very fortunate to have Oblique Seville right next to me,\" said Lyles. \"Because all throughout the year, I feel like he's been hitting that acceleration that I wasn't hitting. So I was like, the fact that he's here means I'm not gonna let him go.\" Seville finished in last place.\n\nAs Lyles' top-end speed kicked in, Brauman -- who was seated along the backstretch near the finish and didn't have a good view of the start -- started feeling hopeful. \"I felt really good when I saw where he was at 60,\" said Brauman. \"OK, we're in the mix.\" Lyles leaned at the finish, which he wasn't supposed to do, since that causes the slightest bit of deceleration that can cost a sprinter. \"I thought I leaned too early,\" said Lyles. But he got away with it. Barely. Like, really, really barely.\n\nAs the runners and 80,000 fans at Stade de France stared at the scoreboard, wondering who won, Lyles went up to Thompson. and told him he thought the title was his. \"Bro, I think you got that one big dog,\" Lyles told him. \"And then my name popped up. And I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.\"\n\nNBC put a microphone on Keisha. She screamed so loud, a producer told her she had to turn the volume on her headphones down.\n\nRead More: 6 Track-and-Field Rivalries to Watch at the Paris Olympics\n\nThe times that appeared on the board -- 9.79 seconds -- were the same for Lyles and Thompson. So why wasn't the race some sort of draw? Turns out, Lyles won his gold medal in 9.784 seconds. Thompson got his silver in 9.789 seconds. American Fred Kerley got bronze in 9.81 seconds.\n\nLyles has guaranteed a sweep of the 100 m, 200 m, and 4 X 100 relay. Usain Bolt accomplished that feat over three straight Games, in Beijing, London, and Rio. Lyles is promising less drama in the 200 m, where he's the reigning three-time World Champion, on Thursday night.\n\n\"When I come off the turn,\" Lyles said on Sunday, his opponents \"will be

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81 and defending champion Marcell Jacobs finished fifth.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\nLyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAnd 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line. He and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point.\n\nBut this would take more than 10 seconds to decide.

In Sunday's men's 100m final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Lyles came in first after a last-second lean towards the finish line.\n\nLyles beat out Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second, one of the closest finishes fans will ever witness. The official record has Lyles and Thompson finishing with the same time of 9.79 seconds, but Lyles still picked up the win by a minuscule amount.\n\nAfter the race, fans noticed that Thompson may have been robbed of gold. In a photo that is going viral on social media with over seven million views, Thompson's foot is clearly well over the finish line before Lyles is.\n\nHowever, Lyles won because his torso was over the line before Thompson's. The official Olympic rules state that the first runner whose torso reaches the finish line wins the race.\n\nDespite what the rule clearly states, fans still protested Lyles' gold medal, believing Thompson was more deserving of the win.\n\n\"KINDA SILLY THAT A FOOT RACE ISNT DECIDED BY FEET\"\n\n\"This race should boycott because my good friend Noah Lyles did not win this race. Head, shoulder, and foot will let anyone win.\"\n\n\"So, what body part has to cross the line first? Because if it's the foot, I haven't seen a pic yet that has Noah Lyles ahead. Did buddy from Jamaica get robbed?\"\n\n\"Noah Lyles crossed the finish line after the Jamaican's foot crossed but apparently who actually crosses the line first physically doesn't matter\"\n\n\"Total robbery! Y'all know Noah Lyles did not win that race! Kishanes foot been over that line before Lyles head!\"\n\nThis win gave Lyles his second Olympic medal ever, with his first coming in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where he won bronze in the 200m race.

While Thompson didn't know who won, Lyles thought the Jamaican star had captured the gold medal.\n\n\"I couldn't see him, but I thought he was seeing me. So he said, 'Hey Kishane, I think you got it done,' but I wasn't really sure,\" Thompson said. \"I could have seen who was to my left and to my right, but he was to my far right, so I wasn't sure.

He invited Netflix cameras to trail him wherever he goes, strutted the runways of Milan and Paris and offered himself up as a guest on the late-night talk-show circuit.\n\nWhenever a microphone or camera is nearby, Lyles hasn't been shy about laying out his grandiose goals for the Paris Olympics. America's fastest man has told anyone who will listen how he intends to eclipse the legendary Usain Bolt, how he hopes to capture four Olympic gold medals, how he'd like to return home a world record holder.\n\n\"Now you're going on the Mount Rushmore,\" he recently explained to the Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon. \"Now you're the greatest of the great.\"\n\nThe first chance for Lyles to back up his audacious talk finally arrived Sunday night when 80,000 roaring fans jammed into Stade de France to watch track and field's glamor race. Lyles took his place alongside eight rivals for the Olympic 100 meters final. For someone, the title of world's fastest man was just a sub-10-second sprint away.\n\nLyles, ever the showman, emerged from the Stade de France tunnel with white beads woven in his hair, nails decorated in red, white and blue. When introduced by the PA announcer, he ran 15 meters down the track, leaping up and down and urging the crowd to get louder.\n\nAfter the starter's gun sounded, Lyles burst out of the blocks surprisingly well and accelerated like his spikes were rocket-powered. He streaked down the track, leaned at the finish line and stared at the video board, waiting to see if he had done enough to win his first career Olympic gold medal.\n\nIt was ... by scarcely more than a blink of an eye.\n\nLyles secured USA's first gold medal in the men's 100 in 20 years, streaking across the finish line in a personal-best 9.79 seconds. Jamaica's Kishane Thompson finished second, five-thousandths of a second behind the American. Fred Kerley of the U.S. earned a bronze medal by running a season-best 9.81 seconds.\n\nAs Lyles said earlier this summer at U.S. Olympic Trials, \"I thrive off big moments. The bigger the moment, the faster I run.\"\n\nLyles' first Olympic gold medal is a big step toward him seeing a return on his conscious effort to go from Olympian to icon, from track-famous to famous-famous. To achieve mainstream status in his sport, the bar is impossibly high. It isn't enough to have broken Michael Johnson's American record in the 200 two years ago, nor to have pulled off the sprint treble at World Championships last August.\n\nLyles needed to excel in the one place that matters most to American viewers. Fair or not, Lyles has to follow in the footsteps of a Bolt, a Simone Biles, a Michael Phelps. He has to pile up gold medals, world records and heroic feats on an Olympic stage.\n\nThat Lyles summoned the speed to capture Olympic gold in the 100 is a massively encouraging sign for the rest of his Paris campaign. The 200 is Lyles' specialty, his first love, the event that maximizes his talents. He holds his speed as well as any sprinter since Bolt, typically enabling him to swallow up anyone in front of him as he rounds the curve and streaks toward the finish line.\n\nThe 100 is Lyles' \"side chick,\" as he has put it, the event that doesn't come naturally to him but that he has worked tirelessly to master. Aware that he struggles to accelerate out of the blocks as quickly as other world-class sprinters, Lyles has tinkered endlessly with his start. The mission has been to find a way to remain in contact at 30 meters without sacrificing Lyles' ability to reach maximum speed and sustain it.\n\nIn his 100 prelim on Saturday morning, Lyles started sluggishly and had to dig just to rally for second place behind reigning NCAA champion Louie Hinchcliffe of Great Britain. He claimed that he expected the rest of the field to \"fall in line\" behind him and that he wouldn't make the mistake of underestimating his adversaries again.\n\n\"What time do you think you have to run to win the gold medal?\" a reporter asked.\n\n\"I don't know, but I'm going to run it,\" Lyles deadpanned.\n\nLyles ran faster in Sunday night's first semifinal, but again he crossed the finish line in second place. Jamaica's Oblique Seville ran a personal best 9.81 seconds and edged Lyles by two hundredths of a second, looking to his left at the American at the end of the race as if to say, \"Where are you?\"\n\nThree years ago, during the last Olympic cycle, Lyles proved unready to seize his moment. Maybe it was the lack of crowds to draw energy from during COVID times. Maybe it was an ill-timed knee injury that interrupted his training. Maybe it was something else.\n\nWhatever the reason, Lyles failed to qualify for Tokyo in the 100. Then he settled for a bronze in his signature 200 when Canada's Andre De Grasse and fellow American Kenny Bednarek overtook him late in the Olympic final.\n\nLyles called his bronze medal \"boring\" in Tokyo.

That was never more on display than Sunday when American Noah Lyles crossed the finish line of the 100M dash just fractions of a second faster than his opponents.\n\nIn fact, during the live broadcast on NBC, commentators mistakenly thought that Jamaican Kishane Thompson had won the race and captured the gold medal.\n\nBut it wasn't Thompson - it was Lyles, who won the race in a photo finish for the ages.\n\nBoth Thompson and Lyles posted the exact same time of 9.79 seconds. However, Lyles was deemed the winner by thousandths of a second.\n\nIt just doesn't get any closer than that.\n\nAnd it was a terrific race for Team USA, as not only did Lyles capture the gold medal to become \"the fastest man on Earth,\" but Fred Kerley took home the bronze medal for America, as well.\n\nKerley finished just .02 seconds behind Thompson and Lyles and just .01 seconds ahead of fourth place to reach the podium.\n\nKerley won a silver medal in the 2020 Tokyo Games in the 100m with a time of 9.84 seconds. That time would not have been good enough to medal in 2024.\n\nThe margins are so insanely thin when it comes to these races, and one small mistake can completely derail a runner.\n\nHowever, the two American runners did just about everything right to earn two of the three spots on the podium, giving the United States two more medals to add to its dominant count in the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nNoah Lyles isn't done yet, either, as he will also compete in the 200m to try and capture a second gold medal for himself and for his country.\n\nHe won the bronze medal in 2020 in Tokyo in the 200m and will look to improve upon that result.\n\nWinning both races at the Olympics is called a \"Double\" and that's exactly what Lyles hopes to accomplish.\n\nIf he pulls it off, he would be the first American to accomplish the feat since Carl Lewis in 1984. Usain Bolt captured the \"Double\" in three straight Olympics (2008, 2012, 2016).\n\nHuge congratulations to Noah Lyles and best of luck in the 200m.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_zaksheske@outkick.com", "name": "Dan Zaksheske", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/noah-lyles-gold-medal-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81 and defending champion Marcell Jacobs finished fifth.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNoah Lyles finished behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the semifinal of the Olympic 100 meters Sunday but still advanced for a rematch in the gold-medal race later in the evening.\n\nSeville is now 2-0 this season against Lyles after finishing in 9.81 seconds, good for a .02-second margin over the American champion.\n\nSeville got off to a stronger start than Lyles, and the American made up ground over the last 40 meters but couldn't completely close the gap. Lyles also lost his opening-round heat -- to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe on Saturday. Hinchliffe finished third in the semifinal and did not advance.\n\nJoining Lyles in the eight-man final will be Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won his semifinal in 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in the three semifinal. Thompson also has the world's best time this year at 9.77; he and Seville are trying to put Jamaica back on top of the Olympic podium for the first time since Usain Bolt retired after the 2016 Games.\n\nDefending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy finished third in the second semifinal and advanced because his 9.92 was the best among sprinters who didn't automatically qualify by finishing in the top two in their heats.\n\nAlso in the final will be Americans Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and South Africa's Akani Simbine.\n\nOther gold medals on the line Sunday night at the Stade de France are in men's hammer throw and women's high jump, where Yaroslava Mahuchikh tries to bring Olympic gold to her war-torn home country of Ukraine.\n\nAP Summer Olympics:

Lyles' journey from childhood health struggles to Olympic gold is truly motivational. Lyles' message of perseverance should be shared widely to motivate all aspiring athletes.\n\nNoah Lyles from Team USA is the Olympic 100m champion. In what was maybe the closest 100m race of all time, Lyles pipped Jamaica's Kishane Thompson at the line to claim his first Olympic gold medal by 0.005 seconds.\n\nAfter his historic victory, the American sprinter took to X, formerly Twitter, to speak to his fans. One of Lyles' posts was a touching tribute to his late high school coach, Rashawn Jackson, who passed away earlier this summer, with the Olympic Champion dedicating his win to him. Lyles followed that heartfelt tribute up with an inspiring message of his own.\n\nHe stated: \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\"\n\nNoah Lyles' Battles to Become 100m Champion\n\nLyles' victory gets more and more inspiring the more you discover what he has been through. Asthma has been something that he has had to deal with since he was a child. In an interview with CNN in 2020, Lyles told the network: \"Asthma definitely affects kind of everything I do in terms of health, physical fitness, and sometimes even emotional well-being.\" Lyles has also said that from about three to four, all the way to about seven years old, he had to deal with asthma and asthma attacks and was in the hospital maybe every third night.\n\nSpeaking about his ADD and dyslexia, the Team USA star said that he was diagnosed with the two conditions around second grade... which made standardised testing and even simple tasks like spelling tests extremely difficult. It takes so much work and dedication to become an Olympic level athlete, and even more if you have to go through what Lyles went through as a child. But Lyles has shown that if you have the spirit and determination, it doesn't matter what you have been through, you can make it. The American isn't just an Olympic athlete, he's now an Olympic champion.\n\nLyles' story and what he has been through to get to this position certainly needs more recognition and hopefully his tweet does that. Not only to give the sprinter his much-deserved praise, but also to show prospective athletes out there that they have a chance to make it, even if they are going through the hardest battles. His message of \"Why Not You!\" should be read by the masses.\n\nNoah Lyles at the Paris Olympics\n\nEven heading into the final, it seemed Lyles was being doubted. He came into these Games as the reigning 100m world champion, but despite his gold medal performance in the World Championships in 2023, he disappointed in the heats and semi-finals. British runner Louie Hinchcliffe won the American's heat, with Hinchcliffe clocking in at 9.98 seconds to Lyles' 10.04. In the semi-final, it was much quicker from Lyles but still only good enough for second place, as Oblique Seville of Jamaica won the race with a time of 9.81, 0.02 seconds faster than Lyles. Both men looked like they had much more to give in the final, though.\n\nAfter his slightly lacklustre qualifying races, it seemed as if Lyles wasn't the favourite heading into the final despite being the world champion. Instead, that title fell to Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson. Lyles, however, had done what he needed to, and made the final, and would have known that the qualifying times don't matter as long as you make it.\n\nThen, in what Michael Johnson described as \"absolutely\" the best 100m final he has watched, Lyles came through when it mattered, and once again overcame all the odds, this time to claim the biggest prize of all, Olympic gold in the 100m, establishing himself as the fastest man in the world.\n\nRelated Why the Men's 100m Final at 2024 Paris Olympics Was Delayed\n\nFans had to wait a little longer than expected for the thrilling contest\n\nLyles won't have too much time to celebrate his victory as he has the 200m heats on the 5th of August, the day after his 100m glory. If you thought he was good in the 100m, the American holds the fourth-fastest time in 200m history with 19.31, behind only Yohan Blake and, of course, Usain Bolt.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yohan Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot-2024-08-05-at-07-43-12.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 4119, "textEnd": 4132}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nYes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The World's Fastest Man.\n\nJust not by very much.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nSo close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nLyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn't work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.\n\n\"But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,\" he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nLyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track -- a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.\n\nThe mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite -- and then, only -- sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission -- the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.\n\nThe practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.\n\nBut when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year -- Thompson -- and another who had beaten him twice this year -- Jamaica's Oblique Seville -- he knew this would be no coronation.\n\nThompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.\n\n\"I thought 'Man, that's my thing, that's crazy,'\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles galloped and leapt about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nNow, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?\n\nCould it have been Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed?\n\nWas it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters over the first 60 meters -- a skill he's been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?\n\nThe answer: all that and more.\n\n\"Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.\n\n\"Seeing that name, I was like 'Oh my gosh, there it is!'\" Lyles said.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nYes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The World's Fastest Man.\n\nJust not by very much.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second.

Lyles previously won bronze in the 200-meter final in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nThe men's 100-meter final occurred roughly two hours after the semifinals, where Lyles came in second place to Jamaica's Oblique Seville and just ahead of Louie Hinchcliffe of Great Britain.\n\nAmerican Kenneth Bednarek also competed in the 100-meter final alongside Lyles and Kerley, 29, and came in seventh with a time of 0.163.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nOn Saturday, Lyles completed the 100-meter heat in second place behind Hinchcliffe, despite being expected to finish the race first.\n\nAfter the heat, Lyles told reporters the second-place finish was his \"first lesson in underestimating the power of the Olympics,\" according to ESPN.\n\n\"The plan was first. But it didn't happen. Second is fine. We'll make sure from here on out it's first,\" Lyles added on Saturday.\n\nAt the 2022 World Athletes Championships, Lyles broke the men's 200-meter world record with a time of 19.31.

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nYes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The World's Fastest Man.\n\nJust not by very much.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys assured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first-ever photo finish.\n\nLyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn't work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.\n\n\"But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,\" he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nLyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track -- a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.\n\nThe mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite -- and then, only -- sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission -- the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.\n\nThe practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.\n\nBut when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year -- Thompson -- and another who had beaten him twice this year -- Jamaica's Oblique Seville -- he knew this would be no coronation.\n\nThompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.\n\n\"I thought, 'Man, that's my thing, that's crazy,'\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles galloped and leaped about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nNow, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?\n\nCould it have been Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line he thought was mistimed?\n\nWas it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters for the first 60 meters -- a skill he's been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?\n\nThe answer: all that and more.\n\n\"Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.\n\n\"Seeing that name, I was like 'Oh my gosh, there it is!'\" Lyles said.\n\nIII\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nIII\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "newstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jefferson City News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Lyles crossed the finish line in 9.784 ahead of the Jamaican Kishane Thompson with a time of 9.789, a difference of only five-thousandths of a second. Another US Olympian, Fred Kerley, rounded out the Paris medalists, winning the bronze medal with a finishing time of 9.81.\n\nNoah Lyles inspires fans\n\nAfter his rousing victory, Noah Lyles went on social media to thank his fans for the support and inspire the next generation of athletics stars.\n\n\"I have asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and depression,\" Lyles wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. For aspiring track runners who want to claim the title of \"fastest in the world,\" Lyles adds, \"But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become.\"\n\n\"Why not you!\" he said, capping off his message.\n\nA few months ago, he caught some heat with the NBA world for his comments on its teams calling themselves \"world champions\" despite playing only in North America. However, Magic Johnson and Dwyane Wade congratulated Lyles for his victory in Paris.\n\nEnding the US' Olympic drought\n\nMeanwhile, the race itself was so close that the runners had to wait for the official photo review to determine who won. They didn't quite know who finished first, and Lyles even believed that the Jamaican had won. \"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" the gold medal winner said. \"I went up to him when we were waiting and I said, 'I think you got that one big dog.'\" When the officials finally announced the winners, even Lyles was surprised. \"And then my name popped up and I'm like, 'Oh gosh, I'm amazing,'\" he said.\n\nWith this Paris win, Noah Lyles ended a 20-year Olympic gold medal drought for the United States in the 100-meter dash. Moreover, his victory came by the narrowest margin since the Olympics adopted electronic timing. The medal only cemented the 27-year-old runner's growing legacy as a world-famous track star, and as the current world champion in the 100m and 200m events.\n\nAsked about the competition, Lyles said, \"It's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents. Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them.\"\n\nOnce again, he finished his response to reporters with a quote for the ages. \"I'm the wolf among wolves,\" he said.\n\nWhat's next for Noah Lyles after his new gold medal? The new fastest man in the world said that he wasn't done yet and added that his goal was to win more gold medals at the 2024 Olympics. Still, this gold might already be his crowning achievement over his bronze in 200m at the Tokyo Olympics and his six gold medals as world champion.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_aaron_gomez@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Aaron Gomez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Noah-Lyles-drops-inspiring-message-after-gold-medal-win.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nLyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn't work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.\n\n\"But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,\" he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nLyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track -- a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.\n\nThe mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite -- and then, only -- sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission -- the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.\n\nThe practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.\n\nBut when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year -- Thompson -- and another who had beaten him twice this year -- Jamaica's Oblique Seville -- he knew this would be no coronation.\n\nThompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.\n\n\"I thought 'Man, that's my thing, that's crazy,'\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles galloped and leapt about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nNow, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?\n\nCould it have been Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed?\n\nWas it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters over the first 60 meters -- a skill he's been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?\n\nThe answer: all that and more.\n\n\"Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.\n\n\"Seeing that name, I was like 'Oh my gosh, there it is!'\" Lyles said.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen

The sprinters waited nervously at the finish line, watching the scoreboard for results. Lyles froze when it showed he had prevailed by one of the narrowest margins -- five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles is the first American to win the Olympic 100-meter since 2004. American Fred Kerley earned bronze in 9.81.\n\nLyles had earned a world championship in the 100-meter only 12 months earlier, when he won three gold medals at those 2023 world championships in Budapest, but he understood that Olympic performances resonate more deeply than any others -- just as they have resonated more deeply with him, too.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles endured disappointment that led to depression after he entered as a 200-meter favorite only to leave with bronze. He has spent the three years since working his way back to a place of physical and mental readiness to redeem himself, a process that culminated Sunday when he burst out of a door next to the starting line after hearing his introduction, waving his arms to fans.\n\n\"I can feel it!\" he mouthed to a television camera before the start.\n\nThen, from the seventh lane, he outlasted a past Olympic champion (Italy's Marcell Jacobs), a former world champion (Kerley of the U.S.) and the owner of the year's fastest time (Thompson).\n\nLyles ripped off his bib with his name while celebrating, thrusting it toward the crowd before appearing to wipe away tears.\n\nThough Lyles claimed the unofficial title of \"world's fastest man\" after winning last year's world championship at 100 meters, he was not the fastest man in his own first-round qualifying heat Saturday, needing to work to run 10.04 in second, even as other legitimate gold-medal contenders including Thompson, Kenya's Ferdinand Omanyala and fellow Americans Kerley and Kenny Bednarek cruised easily through their own heats.\n\nLyles brushed it off as not being harder than he expected, but called it a valuable lesson to be aware that he was running as the man everyone else wanted to beat.\n\n\"I won't let that happen again,\" Lyles said Saturday.\n\nHe lived up to his promise. Racing in the lane next to Great Britain's Louie Hinchcliffe one night later in a semifinal heat, Lyles was far more responsive, crossing the line in 9.83 -- just two hundreds off his personal best -- while locked in a staredown with the only man faster, Jamaican Oblique Seville. By speed and temperament, Lyles appeared focused. But he was not necessarily the man to beat.\n\nLess than hours before the final began, Thompson produced the fastest semifinal of 9.80 while cruising through the line. By qualifying times, it was the most difficult final to make in the event's 128-year Olympic history.\n\nBy the finish time, it was one of the hardest gold medals to earn, too. It belongs to Lyles.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Omanyala", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Omanyala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240804-Noah-Lyles-vl-410p-037efa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nLyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn't work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.\n\n\"But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,\" he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nLyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track -- a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.\n\nThe mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite -- and then, only -- sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission -- the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.\n\nThe practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.\n\nBut when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year -- Thompson -- and another who had beaten him twice this year -- Jamaica's Oblique Seville -- he knew this would be no coronation.\n\nThompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.\n\n\"I thought 'Man, that's my thing, that's crazy,'\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles galloped and leapt about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nNow, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?\n\nCould it have been Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed?\n\nWas it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters over the first 60 meters -- a skill he's been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?\n\nThe answer: all that and more.\n\n\"Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.\n\n\"Seeing that name, I was like 'Oh my gosh, there it is!'\" Lyles said.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line. He and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point.\n\nBut this would take more than 10 seconds to decide.

The sprinters waited nervously at the finish line, watching the scoreboard for results. Lyles froze when it showed he had prevailed by one of the narrowest margins -- five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles is the first American to win the Olympic 100 meters since 2004. American Fred Kerley earned bronze in 9.81.\n\nLyles had earned a world title in the 100 meters only 12 months earlier, when he won three gold medals at those 2023 world championships in Budapest, but he understood that Olympic performances resonate more deeply than any other -- just as they have resonated more deeply with him too.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles endured disappointment that led to depression after he entered as a 200-meter favorite only to leave with bronze. He has spent the three years since working his way back to a place of physical and mental readiness to redeem himself, a process that culminated Sunday when he burst out of a door next to the starting line after hearing his introduction, waving his arms to fans.\n\n\"I can feel it!\" he mouthed to a television camera before the start.\n\nThen, from the seventh lane, he outlasted a past Olympic champion (Italy's Marcell Jacobs), a former world champion (Kerley of the U.S.) and the owner of the year's fastest time (Thompson).\n\nLyles ripped off his bib with his name while celebrating, thrusting it toward the crowd before appearing to wipe away tears.\n\nThough Lyles claimed the unofficial title of \"world's fastest man\" after winning last year's world championship in the 100 meters, he was not the fastest man in his own first-round qualifying heat Saturday, needing to work to run 10.04 in second, even as other legitimate gold-medal contenders including Thompson, Kenya's Ferdinand Omanyala and fellow Americans Kerley and Kenny Bednarek cruised easily through their own heats.\n\nLyles brushed it off as not being harder than he expected, but calling it a valuable lesson that he was running as the man everyone else wanted to beat.\n\n\"I won't let that happen again,\" Lyles said Saturday.\n\nHe lived up to his promise. Racing in the lane next to Great Britain's Louie Hinchcliffe one night later in a semifinal heat, Lyles was far more responsive, crossing the line in 9.83 -- just two-hundredths off his personal best -- while locked in a stare-down with the only man faster, Jamaican Oblique Seville. By speed and temperament, Lyles appeared focused. But he was not necessarily the man to beat.\n\nHours before the final began, Thompson produced the fastest semifinal, 9.80, while cruising through the line. By qualifying times, it was the most difficult final to make in the event's 128-year Olympic history.\n\nBy the finish time, it was one of the hardest gold medals to earn, too.

He just needs to improve by 1%.\n\nThompson ran a 9.79 (.789) to finish second and the USA's Fred Kerley came in third, posting a time of 9.81 to get bronze.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles is the fastest man in the world.\n\nThe U.S. sprinter won the 100 at the Paris Olympics. Lyles crossed the finish line with a gold-medal winning time of 9.79 (.784) in a photo finish to win track and field's marquee sprint event. It took a photo view to reveal Lyles had beaten Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second\n\nThe runners had to wait for photo review moments after the race and didn't know who won seconds after the race. Lyles told reporters following the race that he thought Thompson had won.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I went up to him when we were waiting and I said, 'I think you got that one big dog.' And then my named popped up and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\n\n\"I wasn't ready to see (my name). That's the first time I have ever said that in my head, that I wasn't ready to see it. ... It was hard for me to picture where we were. I guess that was a good thing.\"\n\nThe moment belonged to Lyles inside a packed house at Stade de France as soon as the announcement was made. Lyles is the first American sprinter to win an Olympic gold medal in the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin won gold at the 2004 Athens Games.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" Lyles said after the race. \"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nLyles came into the Olympics confident. He ran a personal-best 9.81 at last month. He told USA TODAY Sports that he wanted to win multiple Olympic gold medals. He's well on his way to achieving his goal.\n\nThe 100 victory earned Lyles his first ever Olympic gold medal. He received a bronze in the 200 at the Tokyo Olympics. He's also a six-time world champion gold medalist, but Sunday's Olympic gold medal in the 100 might be the crowning achievement of his career thus far.\n\n\u27a4 Get Olympics updates in your texts!

In his explanation, Tirico said Olympic races determine a victor when any part of the leading runner's torso crosses the vertical plane of the finish line.\n\nUSA Track & Field, the governing body that oversees Team USA's international track and field competitions, has similar language published in its 2024 USATF Competition Rules.\n\nOn page 67 of the document, under Rule 163 (which concerns running competitions), the first point states: \"Competitors shall be placed at the finish line in the order in which any part of their bodies (i.e., the 'torso,' as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, hands, legs, or feet) reaches the finish line.\" - Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhen does Noah Lyles run next?\n\nLyles will start his pursuit of 200-meter gold Monday with round 1 heats. He's in the sixth heat with Jamaica's Bryan Levell and Canada's Andre De Grasse, the defending 200-meter champion from Tokyo. De Grasse did not qualify for the 100 final. The first heat starts at 7:55 p.m. Monday in Paris (1:55 p.m. ET). The top three in each heat advance to the semifinals, which are Wednesday. The final is Thursday.\n\nKeisha Caine Bishop on Noah Lyles' dreams of turning pro\n\nNoah Lyles' mother knew her sons' dream of becoming professional track stars when they were still teenagers.\n\n\"In 10th grade they wanted to go professional out of high school and I was like are you crazy,\" Keisha Caine Bishop, the mother of Noah and Josephus, told USA TODAY Sports this summer.\n\nIn July 2016 when Noah was 19 years old, he and his younger brother, Josephus, 18 at the time, turned professional and signed a contract with Adidas instead of competing collegiately for the University of Florida.\n\n\"I had to go back and apologize,\" Caine Bishop said. \"I realized that's not fair to kill somebody's dream, especially if they are willing to do the work, and they were willing to do the work.\"\n\nNoah and Josephus have been running professionally since. Josephus isn't on the Olympic team in Paris but ran the 100 and 200 at Olympic trials. - Tyler Dragon\n\nNBC broadcaster incorrectly calls 100 meters race winner\n\nIf you thought Noah Lyles missed out on the gold medal in the 100-meter dash, you weren't the only one.\n\nNBC broadcaster Leigh Diffey was into the moment like the rest of the audience taking in the 100 meters, but he seemed a bit more decisive with his call than what the eye told. As the sprinters crossed the line, the cameras panned to Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson and Diffey declared Thompson the winner, not Lyles.\n\n\"Jamaica's gonna do it, Kishane Thompson is a gold medalist, on debut,\" Diffey declared, before going silent.\n\nThe competitors were all huddled waiting for photo evidence of the finish. When the photo did come in, it was Lyles who was the winner of the race, by five-thousandths of a second over Thompson.\n\nLyles' victory secures the USA's first gold medal in the 100 meter in 20 years, and solidifies his standing as the fastest man in the world. - Joseph Rivera\n\nAccording to World Athletics, it's the first time in history that eight men have broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal race.\n\nUSA's Juliette Whittaker makes it through to 800 final\n\nJuliette Whittaker will be the only American woman in the 800-meter final after squeaking through the semifinals Sunday night.\n\nWhittaker, 20, nabbed the third and final 800-meter spot on Team USA at the Olympic trials but is now the only one of them left. Allie Wilson did not make it out of the first round, and Nia Akins fell short in the semifinals.\n\nAfter making the final and running a personal best of 1 minute, 57.76 seconds, Whittaker said she feels like she's playing with house money now.\n\n\"I think I'm just so excited now just to see what I can do tomorrow, without any expectation,\" she said. \"Even if I get last in the final, I will be overjoyed just to make it that far. So yeah, I'm just excited.\" - Tom Schad\n\n3 Americans qualify for men's 1500-meter final\n\nThere will be plenty of red, white and blue in the men's 1500-meter final.\n\nAll three Americans left in the field qualified for the final, with Yared Nuguse and Hobbs Kessler finishing first and second in one of the two semifinals to advance. Both ran under 3 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nCole Hocker also cruised into the final after placing third in his semi and spending most of the race shadowing two of the medal favorites: Jacob Ingebrigsten of Norway and Josh Kerr of Great Britain.\n\n\"That was just the very last bit of confidence that I needed, heading into the final,\" said Hocker, who ran collegiately at Oregon. - Tom Schad\n\nUSA's Vashti Cunningham finishes fifth in women's high jump\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - Team USA women's high jumper Vashti Cunningham missed out on a medal for the third consecutive Olympics Sunday. Still, despite a troubling back injury this season, she recorded her highest Olympic finish ever (fifth place). The daughter of former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham cleared the bar at 1.86, 1.91 and 1.95 meters, but failed on three attempts to clear 1.98 to fall out of medal contention.\n\nThe gold medal went to Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who cleared 2.0 meters in fewer attempts than silver medalist Nicola Olyslagers of Australia. Ukrainian Iryna Gerashchenko and Australia's Eleanor Patterson tied for the bronze.\n\nCunningham narrowly qualified for the Paris Olympics, but entered ranked No. 7 in the world. She recorded finishes of 13th at the Rio Games in 2016 and sixth at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\n\"I felt good about my performance. I was happy when I made the bar and when I missed the bar, I knew what I was doing wrong,\" Cunningham said. \"I just need to go back to the drawing board and work on a few things.\"\n\nAsked if she's committed to making a run at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, Cunningham said, \"Absolutely. I'm only going to be 30 years old, guys.\" - Chase Goodbread\n\nWeather forecast for 100 final\n\nThere is no rain in the forecast for the men's 100 final.

He narrowly defeated Kishane Thompson of Jamaica with a time of 9.784 seconds in an incredible photo finish.\n\nNot long after, Lyles took to social media to celebrate his win via X. He tweeted a few photos of himself after the race along with the caption \"I Told You America I Got This!\" It was the same words he said directly into the camera after learning he had won.\n\nLyles won by a mere 0.005 seconds, the closest 100-meter dash finish at the Olympics since at least 1980. He also become the first American to win the event since 2004. It is the sprinter's second overall Olympic medal after he won bronze in the 200-meter dash at the Tokyo Olympics, and his first gold.\n\nLyles appeared to be trailing Thompson for much of the contest before he leaped ahead in the final 10 meters. He will also have an opportunity to take home another gold medal in the 200-meter finals on Wednesday night.\n\nThat in mind, he won't have long to celebrate this victory before having to prepare for the next race.\n\nAbout two months before his historic photo finish to win the gold medal in the 100-meter dash at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, American Noah Lyles essentially called his shot.\n\nLyles was coming off the best race of his career, a 9.85-second 100-meter dash at the Racers Grand Prix on June 2. But that wasn't good enough for first place.\n\nInstead, first place went to Jamaica's Oblique Seville, who clocked a 9.82.\n\nEven knowing the Olympics were coming up, Lyles didn't seem stressed at all. In fact, he seemed motivated and energized. And he made a promise of sorts.\n\n\"I say every year, when I get beat y'all need to be scared as s***, because next time you see me you gone be f***** worried,\" Noah Lyles told the Jamaica Observer.\n\nOf course, as things played out, Noah Lyles would get his revenge on Seville. Seville actually finished in last in the 100-meter dash final in Paris, clocking a 9.91 -- still an absurdly fast time, of course.\n\nInstead, it was a different Jamaican that Lyles edged out for the win by five-thousandths of a second: Kishane Thompson. Lyles clocked a 9.784 for the win, his fastest time yet.

Lyles is notorious for talking...a lot of smack. This isn't new, as Lyles frequently backs up his boasting. At the Paris Olympics, Lyles failed in his quest to win the 200-meter gold. However, his true test was in the 100 meters, which he won by a nose, quite literally.\n\nLyles had a lot of ground to make up in very little time. As one of the best finishers in the sport, Lyles is notorious for his closing speed. Despite a valiant effort by Kishane Thompson of Jamaica, who held the lead until the last possible moment, Lyles was able to beat him out by several thousandths of a second.\n\nThe 27-year-old Lyles congratulated Thompson after the race, waiting on a photo finish that took all too long to appear on-screen. Upon winning, Lyles pointed to the camera and told all Americans what he's been saying all along: I told you so.\n\nWhy do NBA fans dislike Noah Lyles?\n\nThe majority of Americans were thrilled Lyles took home gold on Sunday night in Paris. The key word in that statement is most.\n\nNBA fans have a love-hate relationship with Lyles. On the one hand, he's one of the best athletes of his generation. On the other, he doesn't consider the Boston Celtics -- or any team which wins the NBA title -- to be world champions. After the World Championships in Budapest a year ago, Lyles unleashed a quote that makes sense as it pertains to track and field, but not necessarily basketball.\n\n\"You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head,\" Lyles said. \"World champion of what? The United States? Don't get me wrong, I love the U.S. at times, but that ain't the world...We are the world.\"\n\nNBA fans had a field day with such a statement for obvious reasons. The Celtics aren't losing to a professional basketball team in Turkey. Next question.\n\nNBA fans didn't want Noah Lyles to win gold\n\nIf there were any group of Americans rooting against Lyles, it was NBA fans. The tweets would have been impeccable. Unfortunately for them, however, Lyles lived up to the hype and held up his end of the bargain, winning gold by the narrowest of margins.\n\nAll we can do is respect the hustle.

During the 100-meter dash final, the two-time Olympian ran a personal best of 9.79 seconds to clinch his first Olympic title.\n\nLyles is the American record holder in the 200-meter dash and has earned six world championship titles. He made his Olympic debut in Tokyo, where he earned bronze in the 200-meter dash. Since then, he has not lost a major championship in the event.\n\nAlthough the 100-meter dash is not Lyle's strongest event, he managed to earn a spot in what can be called the toughest 100-meter dash final in history. At every global championship but the 2015 world championships, 10 seconds flat would always, at the very least, make the final. During the 2015 world championships, the slowest qualifying time was 9.99 seconds.\n\nThis year, five athletes ran 10 seconds flat or faster but still did not make the final. The last person to make it into this year's Olympic final was 200-meter dash Olympic silver medalist Kenny Bednarek at 9.93 seconds.\n\nJoining Bednarek and Lyles was Tokyo silver medalist Fred Kerley, putting all three Americans in the final. 2012 was the last Olympics where all three USA men made the 100-meter dash final.\n\nAlthough Lyles was able to pull off earning an Olympic title, his journey in this event was not easy.\n\nLyles ran at a meet in Jamaica where he lost to Oblique Seville, one of Jamaica's top sprinters. In that race, Seville looked smooth, while Lyles looked like he had expended more energy to run as well as he did.\n\nThe world champion only came into the Olympics ranked third, with Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and Kenya's Ferdinand Omanyala ranked first and second. Thompson's world-leading time of 9.77 seconds and Omanyala's time of 9.79 seconds are faster than Lyles' previous lifetime best.\n\nIn round one of the Paris 100-meter dash, NCAA champion and Great Britain athlete Louie Hinchcliffe beat Lyles. In the semi-finals today, Seville handed Lyles another second-place finish. Fans and spectators were concerned for Lyle's odds of securing gold and even making the podium after not winning either qualifying round.\n\nConsidering the top four fastest men going into the final ran 9.80 seconds, 9.81 seconds, 9.83 seconds, and 9.84 seconds, it was clear that if Lyles wanted gold, he would need to run the best race of his life.\n\nThe world champion did not have a stellar start to his race in the final, but he is mostly known for his vicious top-end speed, where he can close significant gaps on his competition in the last 30 meters of his race.\n\nThis graphic shows how Lyles was in eighth place for the first 40 meters of the race. He moved from seventh to third place in just 10 meters. Even at 90 meters, he was only in second. It took until the last moment for Lyles to pull off his first Olympic gold medal. Readers can click here to see the analysis of the other competitors.\n\nThe most interesting part of the anticipation for the results is that neither Lyles nor Thompson thought they won after racing. During the press conference, Lyles and Thompson recounted the moment they crossed the finish line.\n\n\"After that race, I came up. We were waiting for the names to pop up,\" said Lyles. \"I'm going to be honest. When I came over, I was like, 'I think you got that big dawg'.\"\n\nThompson went on to express how, from his perspective, he thought Lyles had beaten him because he couldn't see Lyles based on the lanes they were in.\n\n\"It was really a close race because I couldn't really see Noah,\" said Thompson. \"When we both crossed the line... he came to me and said, 'Hey man, I think you got it,' but I was like, 'I'm not even sure' because it was that close.\"\n\nTheir names appeared on the results list, with Lyles and Thompson having the same time of 9.79 seconds. However, Lyles' name appeared first because he won by .005 of a second.\n\nThis is Thompson's first Olympic games, and he has already earned a silver medal at just 23-years old. Kerley did not have the most typical year, but he managed to pull together a season's best and earn the USA another spot on the podium.\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs placed fifth overall while running a season's best. Respect should also be given to Akani Simbine, who placed fourth, and Letsile Tebogo, who placed sixth, as they ran national records for their respective home countries.\n\nAlthough Bednarek did not place as high as he hoped, he has a chance to redeem himself during the 200-meter dash. Seville has the opportunity to appear on Jamaica's 4x100-meter relay.\n\nLyles has talked extensively about wanting to earn four Olympic gold medals from the 100-meter and 200-meter dash, the 4x100-meter relay, and the 4x400-meter relay. So far, he has one down and three more to go.\n\nIf Noah Lyles can win the 200-meter dash, he will be the first man since Carl Lewis in 1984 to win both sprint medals at the Olympics.\n\nThe next event Lyles will contest is the 200-meter dash, which begins on August 5th at 1:55 p.m. EST. He will compete in the 4x100-meter relay on August 9th and must wait to see if he is chosen for the 4x400-meter relay on August 10th.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles has been claiming to be \"the fastest man alive\" since becoming the reigning world champion in the 100-meter race last year.\n\nAfter Sunday night's race, the American can now claim that title without contest.\n\nLyles ran 9.79 seconds, a personal best, in the Sunday night competition at Stade de France, to claim his first Olympic gold.\n\nAhead of start time, Lyles, known for his dramatics and showmanship, came onto the track with arms raised to whip up the crowd, finishing his pre-race show by darting up and down about a quarter of the 100-meter distance he was about to run.\n\nOnce the shot fired, the American got a classically sluggish start but accelerated enough to beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who -- before tonight -- was the fastest man this year. He also posted 9.79, prompting a nail-biting few moments as everyone in the stadium waited for the photo finish results to develop.\n\nComputers show Lyles leaned forward to cross the line five-thousands of a second faster than Thompson.\n\nFred Kerley of the U.S. came in third place .02 seconds later to win bronze.\n\nLyles' victory in the 100m is the first U.S. gold in the Olympic event since Justin Gatlin won in 2004.\n\nAs for Thompson, he'll be first Jamaican to make it to the podium since Usain Bolt's Olympic reign ended with the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.\n\nIn the semifinal, fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville ran a personal best 9.81, finishing ahead of Lyles by .02 after the American had another rough start.\n\nLyles' celebrity rose after last month's release of the Netflix docuseries Sprint, which follows several of the fastest runners currently at the Paris Games in their quest for Olympic gold.\n\nLyles is the reigning world champion in the 100m and the 200m. It's also why the showman already liked to call himself the \"fastest man alive.\" He also won the bronze in the 200-meter race at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nUltimately, Lyles is chasing Bolt's world record in both. Bolt's 100-meter record is 9.58 seconds.\n\nLyles is not known for his start out of the blocks, which is why the 200-meter is his better event. He'll have a chance to prove that on Thursday night.\n\nIf he does win, Lyles would be the first male sprinter to achieve the Olympic sprint double since Bolt did it at Rio in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa4f908/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3107x1631+0+349/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F3107x2330%20194%200%2Fresize%2F3107x2330%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F31%2F39%2Fa54d42234e4aa13b3faf7987a1f2%2Fap24217723641695.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when timing didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAnd 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.", "source": {"uri": "dcnewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DC News Now | Washington, DC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dcnewsnow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silvio Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allan Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.dcnewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/08/AP24217723641695.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Lyles ran the race in 9.784 seconds; Kishane Thompson of Jamaica won silver with a time of 9.789 seconds, while the U.S.'s Fred Kerley won bronze, in 9.81 seconds.\n\nLyles, also the three-time defending 200-m world champion, backed up brash predictions of sprint domination. He has historically enjoyed more success in the 200; Lyles finished seventh at the U.S. Olympic trials in the 100 m in 2021, failing to make the American team.\n\n\"I'm here to race anybody who wants it,\" he declared to TIME before the Olympics. \"The deeper the field, the better I run. I know I'm going to win. Because I'm never going to break nerve.\"\n\nThe Olympics are now a scene of Lyles' greatest triumph, rather than his most transformative failure. Lyles struggled to improve his mental health before the Tokyo Olympics, as pandemic isolation darkened the mood of the athlete's typically extroverted persona. Plus, the murder of George Floyd in 2020 added to his stress. And once he arrived in Tokyo, the lack of electricity in a stadium with no fans also held Lyles back.\n\nRead More: Noah Lyles Brings His Speed and Sizzle To The Olympics\n\nBut an underperformance in Tokyo, where he finished third in the 200 m, a race where he was the favorite, sparked Lyles to revise his training. Recalling his memories from Tokyo in a meeting with reporters in Paris this week, Lyles said: \"This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted. This is not what I thought it was going to be like. And that's literally the last few thoughts I had going into my mind as I got into the blocks. And it sucked.\"\n\nLyles, the favorite in the 200 m that year as he had run the world's fastest time of the year going into Tokyo, finished a disappointing third. He broke down in tears while meeting with reporters afterwards, in detailing his difficult mental-health journey, and guilt that his younger brother Josephus, another elite sprinter, hadn't made the Olympics with him. (Josephus did not qualify for Paris.)\n\nComing out of Tokyo, Lyles decided to revamp his training program. In essence, he'd work smarter, not necessarily harder. (Though by all accounts, Lyles still grinds for hours on the track.) Since 2021, Lyles has put on some 10 lb. of muscle, which has allowed him to position his body at more efficient angles in the blocks, and generate more force and higher speeds at the beginning of his races. He's worked with a biomechanist to improve his start time, long considered his weakness. Winning a silver medal at the 60-m indoor world championships in Glasgow earlier this year gave Lyles confidence that these efforts were paying off.\n\n\"There are tons of people out there who claim that I have horrible starts,\" said Lyles last week. \"But you know, somebody with a horrible start can't get a silver medal or run 6.43 in the 60.\"\n\nRead More: Which Olympic Sport Is Hardest on the Body?\n\nLyles set out to conquer the 200 m; that final is on Aug. 8, followed by the 4x100 relay the next night. The last male Olympian to sweep those three events was Usain Bolt.\n\n\"I get to finally say it, I'm showing up to an Olympic Games not depressed,\" Lyles said in Paris. \"And it feels amazing. It's a lot of joy, a lot of joy. And even though there's hard times in the moment, I can always think back to the last Olympics and be like, \"No, this one is, is not the same. This one is way better.' And I'm ready to show it.\"\n\nHe showed it. And his very best could still be coming.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josephus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noah-lyles-100-m-gold-paris-olympics.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 3228, "textEnd": 3234}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Going through the rounds it looked like a foregone conclusion that Kishane Thompson would win as he was the one who came in as the fastest man in the world,\" Johnson said on BBC TV.\n\n\"We had this amazing race where you could throw a blanket over the finishing line.\n\n\"We didn't even know who won for a few minutes.\"\n\nHow Lyles came from nowhere to win Olympic gold\n\n'He can hold speed and endurance a really long time' - Johnson on Lyles\n\nNot until the big screen inside the stadium displayed the official results, after an agonising wait, did anybody truly know Lyles had taken gold.\n\nIt was not until the very last metres on the eye-catching purple track that he was even in contention.\n\nLyles tied with Letsile Tebogo for the slowest reaction time of anyone in the field, a time of 0.178 notably down on Fred Kerley's lightning 0.108.\n\nYet Tebogo would go on to cross the line in sixth, while Kerley could only hold on for bronze.\n\n\"Lyles didn't even have a medal 10 metres out. He didn't have a hope of winning,\" Olympic medallist Steve Cram said on BBC TV.\n\nLyles was in last place with 40 metres of the race gone.\n\nBy halfway he was seventh.\n\nBut the 27-year-old hit his top speed of 43.6 kilometres per hour at 60 metres to enter medal contention, then closed far better than any rival to clinch the ultimate prize with his very last stride.\n\nThompson, the fastest man in the world this year with a best time of 9.77, maintained a lead from 30 metres into the race, to 10 metres from the finish line.\n\nIt was the finest margins which determined the outcome, as Lyles covered the distance between 80-90 metres in 0.84 and the final 10 metres in 0.86 - compared to 0.85 and 0.87 for Thompson.\n\n\"I did think [Thompson] had it at the end. I went up to him while we were waiting, and said 'I think you've got that, good going,' and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing',\" Lyles said.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it.\"\n\nReflecting on narrowly missing out on gold, 23-year-old Thompson said: \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learned from it.\"\n\nThe drama at the head of the race inspired world records behind it.\n\nThe finishing times for Akani Simbine, Lamont Marcell Jacobs, Tebogo, Kenny Bednarek and Seville were all world records for fourth to eighth place finishers in a 100m race.\n\nSouth Africa's Simbine ran a personal best for fourth and said: \"Missing the medal by 0.01, it's actually really crazy, but yeah, I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nLyles building legacy with each global gold\n\nLyles has long positioned himself as the heir to Usain Bolt's throne, combining on-track performances with off-track flair in his bid to establish himself as the new superstar of men's athletics.\n\nNot afraid to raise expectations through his own comments, Lyles has spoken about his desire to break the long-standing 100m and 200m records set by Jamaica's eight-time Olympic champion Bolt, who retired in 2017.\n\nThe American also claimed he will target four golds in Paris by adding the men's 4x400m relay to his schedule after winning the world 100m, 200m and 4x100m title in Budapest 12 months ago.\n\nLyles will next pursue the Olympic 200m title as a three-time defending world champion in the event, although he had to settle for bronze on his Games debut in Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"Lyles had a bad Tokyo and since then he's really been looking for big moments,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"He wants to be a global superstar. He talks about Usain Bolt and the type of person he was. He's talked about his sport and voiced his frustration about how it doesn't give you that platform.\"\n\nIt is 16 years since Bolt strolled to the first of his three Olympic 100m golds in Beijing, showboating as he crossed the line but still clocking a world record 9.69 - which he improved to the still-standing mark of 9.58 in 2009.\n\nLyles is yet to get close to that time, running under 9.80 for the first time to win on Sunday night, while his 200m best of 19.31 also trails Bolt's best (19.19).\n\nBut, like Bolt, Lyles stars on the sport's grandest stages and he continues to amass global golds at a considerable rate.\n\n\"Noah Lyles is able to back it up,\" Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis said on BBC TV.\n\n\"He has been amplifying the need for people to take this sport more seriously, deliver and respect the athletes for what they deliver, which is sensational entertainment every single time.\n\n\"To do this here, with the amphitheatre of the lights, the drama, everything, is just brilliant.\"\n\nJohnson added: \"He is here to create a legacy and he has put the first stamp down on that legacy by taking this title in such imperious fashion.\"", "source":

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81 and defending champion Marcell Jacobs finished fifth.\n\nLyles finished behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the semifinal of the Olympic 100 meters, but still advanced for a rematch in the gold-medal race later in the evening.\n\nSeville is now 2-0 this season against Lyles after finishing in 9.81 seconds, good for a .02-second margin over the American champion.\n\nSeville got off to a stronger start than Lyles, and the American made up ground over the last 40 meters but couldn't completely close the gap. Lyles also lost his opening-round heat -- to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe on Saturday. Hinchliffe finished third in the semifinal and did not advance.\n\nMORE OLYMPICS\n\nHow Paris healed a 44-year-old wound for a N.J. judo family\n\nI've found the Jerseyiest place at the Paris Olympics\n\nRutgers 'power couple' finds joy in shared Olympic dream\n\nTwo N.J. swimmers turned a Somerset County pool into an Olympic hotbed\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone aces 1st test as she defends her gold medal at the Paris Olympics\n\nJoining Lyles in the eight-man final will be Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won his semifinal in 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in the three semifinal. Thompson also has the world's best time this year at 9.77; he and Seville are trying to put Jamaica back on top of the Olympic podium for the first time since Usain Bolt retired after the 2016 Games.\n\nDefending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy finished third in the second semifinal and advanced because his 9.92 was the best among sprinters who didn't automatically qualify by finishing in the top two in their heats.\n\nAlso in the final will be Americans Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and South Africa's Akani Simbine.\n\nOther gold medals on the line Sunday

It made Lyles the first American, male or female, to win the event since Justin Gatlin took gold in the 2004 Athens Games.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted,\" said Lyles, whose winning time was a personal best. \"It's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents. Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them. I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles' victory was only confirmed after a photo finish. The American said of the wait for the final results: \"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, bro, I think you had that one.' And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nLyles added: \"It's been a rollercoaster, ups and downs. I'm usually a guy who likes to come out blazing in all my rounds, especially in the 200m. But the 100m, it's my first time here on the Olympic stage.\"\n\nThe relatively unknown Thompson, the fastest man this year with a best of 9.77 seconds, said he hadn't been \"fresh enough\" over the final 30 meters.\n\n\"I couldn't really see Lyles, I wasn't sure,\" 23-year-old Thompson said of the photo-finish. \"It was that close. I'm going to take it and move forward from here. Everybody loves a winner so I would have loved to win today, but I loved the competition overall.\"\n\nLyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81 seconds, just one-hundredth ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who timed 9.82 seconds.\n\n\"I don't feel any frustration because I'm facing the best in the world,\" said Kerley, the 2022 world champion and Olympic silver medallist over 100m three years ago at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"At the end of the day, not many people can say they came to the Olympic Games,\" Kerley said. \"Whoever came off the best is the best. It's my second time around and I'm going off with a medal.\"\n\nIn an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85 seconds, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86 seconds, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88 seconds and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91 seconds.\n\nStarting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern. Head tucked down through to the 40-meter mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way. As Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters adjusted their starting blocks. The lights then went off and the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum, with each sprinter individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart. Lyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 meters down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable, while the only sound was that of a helicopter whirring overhead. The shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track to the dramatic denouement.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze. Asked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt.\n\n\"100 percent,\" he said. \"That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to take it to the 200.\"", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thompson, after cruising through the qualifying rounds, was the favorite in the race.\n\nFellow American Fred Kerley took the bronze medal in 9.81 seconds.\n\nLyles set a personal best time of 9.79 seconds in the win. Thompson has a personal best of 9.77 seconds, but couldn't match that in Paris.\n\nHistorically a slow starter, Lyles again had to run down the fastest starters. He had a reaction time of 0.178, tied for worst in the field. Kerley, however, had a race-best 0.108 reaction time, the fastest in the field and a big reason he was able to race onto the podium.\n\nIt was the first time an American had won the 100 meters since 2004 when Justin Gatlin took the title in Athens. It's also the first time since 2004 that two Americans finished on the podium. Jamaica, led by world record holder Usain Bolt, had dominated the sprints for the last two decades.\n\nKerley, 29, had taken silver at the Tokyo Games and was looking to move up one spot on the podium. Instead, he settled for bronze with a season's best time.\n\nLyles may have been the favorite going into Paris, but he'd looked like anything but a sure thing in the heats. He finished second in his opening race and said afterward he'd misjudged the speed of the field. He finished second again in the semifinal to Jamaican Oblique Seville, who cruised to a 9.81, while Lyles had to make up for a slow start as he qualified for the final with a 9.83.\n\nThompson had run a 9.80 in the semifinals -- the fastest time of any of the qualifiers for the final -- without even showing max effort.\n\nThe defending champion from Tokyo, Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs, finished fifth with a time of 9.85. The time was a season's best for Jacobs, who was a surprise winner in 2021 and hasn't reached those heights in the three years since Tokyo.\n\nLyles was the defending world champion in the 100 meters from last year. He ran a 9.83 in the final in Budapest as he won gold.\n\nIt also took a run of just 9.83 seconds to win the U.S. trials earlier this summer.\n\nLyles, 27, has surged into the best in the world in the 100 meters after already establishing himself as the best at the 200 meters. Lyles has said his goal was to win double gold and the 100 meters was the hardest of those two. He won both 100 and 200 at the world championships in 2023.\n\nThe 200-meter heats begin Monday with the final on Aug. 8.\n\nLyles is also likely to compete in the 4x100 meter relay on Aug. 9 as he tries to complete a sweep of three golds like he did in Budapest at the world championships.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2024/08/bb1c03e0ddec187f1f10fff51ee0e2be.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2665, "textEnd": 2671}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2734, "textEnd": 2740}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It was not easy, as the photos would show.\n\nThe win would come down to a photo finish separated by just thousandths of a second (he beat the silver medalist, Kishane Thompson, by .005 seconds, and the bronze medalist, Fred Kerley of the U.S. by .02 seconds). The competition matched the hype of the moment, as Lyles had to battle back from a group-worst reaction time off the blocks.\n\nAfter the race, it was too close to call with a naked eye. Broadcasters called it wrong. Fans watching at home called it wrong. Even Lyles called it wrong.\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated senior writer Greg Bishop, who was on site to tell the story, Lyles approached Thompson after the 10-second event and said, \"Hey, man,\" Lyles told him, \"I think you got it.\"\n\nOf course, no one is happier to be wrong in this instance than Lyles.\n\nLyles came to win this race and announce himself to the world.

Noah Lyles talked an awful lot of talk in the build-up to Paris 2024, but tonight he backed up the bluster with blistering speed on the Stade de France track, surging past the field to pip them all on the line. There can be no argument now. \"What's the title of Olympic champion?\" Lyles said, referring to \"the fastest man on the planet\" tag that goes with gold. \"Amen.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter that he didn't get near the world record he said he'd break, finishing in 9.79. It doesn't matter that the winning margin was only five thousandths of a second, a time too miniscule to comprehend. Jamaica's Kishane Thompson had been burdened with the title of heir to Usain Bolt after running the fastest time this year, and he led for 99m of this race. But Lyles fought back from dead last at 40m and they crossed the line together.\n\nThompson roared in celebration but his face dropped when the giant screen displayed \"photo finish\" by his name. They stared up from purgatory, waiting for the verdict.\n\n\"Kishane, I think you got it, man,\" Lyles told Thompson, with a pat on the shoulder.\n\nThompson looked pained. \"Come on, man!\" he shouted at the screen, urging it to move. \"Come on, man!\"\n\nLyles paced with his hands on his head. Then the result came and Lyles was off again, one moment ripping the name from his chest and raising it to the gods, the next streaking across the hammer field with the stars and stripes flapping in the wind. Thompson was awarded silver as Lyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze.\n\n\"I was prepared to see his name pop up,\" Lyles said. \"I saw my name pop up and I said, 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible'. It's the one I wanted. It's the hard battle, the amazing opponents, everybody was healthy and came to fight. I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nThompson hoped to be the first Jamaican man since Bolt to win a global 100m title.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" he said. \"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and myself, I should have let my speed bring me to the line. I've learned from it. I couldn't see Noah, but I think he could see me and said, 'hey, Kishane, I thought you got it'. But he was too far to my right so I wasn't sure. This is my closest race. It was that close.\"\n\nThe US prides itself on its dominance in track and field but an American had not won this race for 20 years, not since Justin Gatlin in Athens. Bolt won the next three in Beijing, London and Rio before Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs stunned the world in Tokyo. Jacobs finished fifth here in 9.85 sec, behind South Africa's Akani Simbine who came fourth in 9.82.\n\nOne by one, Lyles picked them all off.\n\n\"It was hard for me to picture where we were, and I guess that was a good thing,\" he said. \"I was fortunate to have [Jamaica's] Oblique Seville next to me because all throughout the year he's been hitting that acceleration that I wasn't hitting. I wasn't going to let him go.\"\n\nThis could be just the start. Lyles still has the 200m, his strongest event, as well as a 4x100m showdown with the Jamaicans.\n\n\"There's plenty more.

American teammate Fred Kerley, who won silver at the Tokyo Olympics, went home with the bronze with a time of 9.81.\n\nLyles' sprint was a personal best time of 9.79 in a race among eight of the fastest men in the world.\n\nWith body positioning part of the winning formula at the finish line, it's important to note Olympic rules base the official finish off the torso of the runner, from the clavicle down. So, crossing feet and arms don't count.\n\nWith his win, Lyles becomes the first American to win an Olympic gold in the 100 with his 9.79 since Justin Gatlin's 9.85 in 2004.\n\nSpeaking after the race, the Alexandria, Va., native got emotional talking about his late high school track coach, Rashawn Jackson. Jackson, a coach at Alexandria City High School, died earlier this summer, the school announced in July.\n\n\"I remember when I was running on the back stretch and I was like, 'This one's for you, man', and I thought he was going to be here to see it,\" Lyles said before pausing to fight back tears.\n\n\"I know that he's watching...because he believed that I was gonna be a 100 meter runner just as much as I was going to be a 200 meter runner.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Lyles said he wanted to win four gold medals at the Paris Games. He said winning his first in the 100m dash put him \"on Cloud 9.\"\n\n\"I just got the hardest one out of the way,\" he said, adding that he's still got competition in other races.\n\n\"I felt that [the 100m] was the one that could have slipped away from me.\"\n\nNext up for Lyles is the men's 200m on Tuesday, an event in which he is the reigning world champion.\n\nLyles won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in the 200m, at a time when he was vocal about struggling with his mental health.\n\nOvercoming those struggles, Lyles has had an outstanding year on the track, and has made no secret of his wish to go for gold in both the 100m and 200m.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_City_High_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria City High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clavicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/08/image-4-2.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The 100m final was record-breaking; the first time every athlete ran under 10 seconds, showcasing the slim margins between the competitors. Lyles' surprise victory over Thompson by 0.005 seconds led to a heartfelt reaction.\n\nTeam USA sprinter Noah Lyles claimed a stunning 100m title at the Stade de France in the men's final, despite being outside the medal places for most of the race. Post-race analysis has shown how Lyles was sat in eighth place for the first 50m of the race before moving through the gears to claim his first Olympic gold in a remarkable victory.\n\nAthletics journalist Jonathan Gault posted on X: \"Olympic 100m race analysis. Noah Lyles was last at 30 metres and did not lead at any point until the final steps. But he was leading when it counted.\" A graphic was also posted by Gault that showed how Lyles was in seventh place as late as halfway into the race and wasn't the front-runner in the final until its very last moments.\n\nMen's 100m Final at Paris Olympics\n\nLyles pipped Jamaican Kishane Thompson to the title by 0.005 seconds, with the win being decided in a photo-finish. Thompson had looked set to claim the gold medal, after moving into the lead 30 metres into the race and remaining there until the final stages when Lyles snatched victory. The American eventually finished with a new personal best time of 9.79.\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Key Statistic: The 100m final at the Paris Olympics was the first time ever that every athlete ran under 10 seconds.\n\nThe post-race analysis also demonstrated the wafer-thin margins that separate athletes at this high level of competition, with just 0.12 seconds between Lyles in first place and Oblique Seville in eighth. Defending champion Lamont Jacobs of Italy had a disappointing end to the race and slipped out of the medal places and into fifth despite being third until the final 30 metres. The race was officially the fastest in history, with all eight men finishing in under 10 seconds.\n\nNoah Lyles' Reaction to Winning 100m Gold\n\nThe victor, Lyles, expressed his surprise at the result after the race, saying: \"I did think [Thompson] had it at the end. I went up to him while we were waiting, and said 'I think you've got that, good going', and then my name popped up, and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing.' I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it. It was hard for me to picture where we were, and I guess that was a good thing. I was fortunate to have [Jamaica's] Oblique Seville next to me because all throughout the year he's been hitting that acceleration that I wasn't hitting. I wasn't going to let him go.\"\n\nKishane Thompson's reaction to 100m final\n\nThompson reflected on his disappointment at missing out on gold, an achievement that would have made him the first Jamaican to win a global 100m title since Usain Bolt: \"I'm a bit disappointed, but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" he said. \"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and myself, I should have let my speed bring me to the line. I've learned from it. I couldn't see Noah, but I think he could see me and said, 'hey, Kishane, I thought you got it'. But he was too far to my right, so I wasn't sure. This is my closest race.

He just needs to improve by 1%.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles is the fastest man in the world.\n\nThe U.S. sprinter won the 100 at the Paris Olympics. Lyles crossed the finish line with a gold-medal winning time of 9.79 (.784) in a photo finish to win track and field's marquee sprint event. It took a photo view to reveal Lyles had beaten Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second\n\nThompson ran a 9.79 (.789) to finish second and Fred Kerley came in third, posting a time of 9.81 to get bronze.\n\nThe runners had to wait for photo review moments after the race and didn't know who won seconds after the race. Lyles told reporters following the race that he thought Thompson had won.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I went up to him when we were waiting and I said, 'I think you got that one big dog.' And then my named popped up and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\n\n\"I wasn't ready to see (my name). That's the first time I have ever said that in my head, that I wasn't ready to see it. ... It was hard for me to picture where we were. I guess that was a good thing.\"\n\nThe moment belonged to Lyles inside a packed house at Stade de France as soon as the announcement was made. Lyles is the first American sprinter to win an Olympic gold medal in the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin won gold at the 2004 Athens Games.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" Lyles said after the race. \"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nLyles came into the Olympics confident. He ran a personal-best 9.81 at last month. He told USA TODAY Sports that he wanted to win multiple Olympic gold medals. He's well on his way to achieving his goal.\n\nThe 100 victory earned Lyles his first ever Olympic gold medal. He received a bronze in the 200 at the Tokyo Olympics. He's also a six-time world champion gold medalist, but Sunday's Olympic gold medal in the 100 might be the crowning achievement of his career thus far.\n\n\u27a4 Get Olympics updates in your texts!

He's in the sixth heat with Jamaica's Bryan Levell and Canada's Andre De Grasse, the defending 200-meter champion from Tokyo. De Grasse did not qualify for the 100 final. The first heat starts at 7:55 p.m. Monday in Paris (1:55 p.m. ET). The top three in each heat advance to the semifinals, which are Wednesday. The final is Thursday.\n\nKeisha Caine Bishop on Noah Lyles' dreams of turning pro\n\nNoah Lyles' mother knew her sons' dream of becoming professional track stars when they were still teenagers.\n\n\"In 10th grade they wanted to go professional out of high school and I was like are you crazy,\" Keisha Caine Bishop, the mother of Noah and Josephus, told USA TODAY Sports this summer.\n\nIn July 2016 when Noah was 19 years old, he and his younger brother, Josephus, 18 at the time, turned professional and signed a contract with Adidas instead of competing collegiately for the University of Florida.\n\n\"I had to go back and apologize,\" Caine Bishop said. \"I realized that's not fair to kill somebody's dream, especially if they are willing to do the work, and they were willing to do the work.\"\n\nNoah and Josephus have been running professionally since. Josephus isn't on the Olympic team in Paris but ran the 100 and 200 at Olympic trials. - Tyler Dragon\n\nNBC broadcaster incorrectly calls 100 meters race winner\n\nIf you thought Noah Lyles missed out on the gold medal in the 100-meter dash, you weren't the only one.\n\nNBC broadcaster Leigh Diffey was into the moment like the rest of the audience taking in the 100 meters, but he seemed a bit more decisive with his call than what the eye told. As the sprinters crossed the line, the cameras panned to Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson and Diffey declared Thompson the winner, not Lyles.\n\n\"Jamaica's gonna do it, Kishane Thompson is a gold medalist, on debut,\" Diffey declared, before going silent.\n\nThe competitors were all huddled waiting for photo evidence of the finish. When the photo did come in, it was Lyles who was the winner of the race, by five-thousandths of a second over Thompson.\n\nLyles' victory secures the USA's first gold medal in the 100 meter in 20 years, and solidifies his standing as the fastest man in the world. - Joseph Rivera\n\nAccording to World Athletics, it's the first time in history that eight men have broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal race.\n\nUSA's Juliette Whittaker makes it through to 800 final\n\nJuliette Whittaker will be the only American woman in the 800-meter final after squeaking through the semifinals Sunday night.\n\nWhittaker, 20, nabbed the third and final 800-meter spot on Team USA at the Olympic trials but is now the only one of them left. Allie Wilson did not make it out of the first round, and Nia Akins fell short in the semifinals.\n\nAfter making the final and running a personal best of 1 minute, 57.76 seconds, Whittaker said she feels like she's playing with house money now.\n\n\"I think I'm just so excited now just to see what I can do tomorrow, without any expectation,\" she said. \"Even if I get last in the final, I will be overjoyed just to make it that far. So yeah, I'm just excited.\" - Tom Schad\n\n3 Americans qualify for men's 1500-meter final\n\nThere will be plenty of red, white and blue in the men's 1500-meter final.\n\nAll three Americans left in the field qualified for the final, with Yared Nuguse and Hobbs Kessler finishing first and second in one of the two semifinals to advance. Both ran under 3 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nCole Hocker also cruised into the final after placing third in his semi and spending most of the race shadowing two of the medal favorites: Jacob Ingebrigsten of Norway and Josh Kerr of Great Britain.\n\n\"That was just the very last bit of confidence that I needed, heading into the final,\" said Hocker, who ran collegiately at Oregon. - Tom Schad\n\nUSA's Vashti Cunningham finishes fifth in women's high jump\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - Team USA women's high jumper Vashti Cunningham missed out on a medal for the third consecutive Olympics Sunday. Still, despite a troubling back injury this season, she recorded her highest Olympic finish ever (fifth place). The daughter of former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham cleared the bar at 1.86, 1.91 and 1.95 meters, but failed on three attempts to clear 1.98 to fall out of medal contention.\n\nThe gold medal went to Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who cleared 2.0 meters in fewer attempts than silver medalist Nicola Olyslagers of Australia. Ukrainian Iryna Gerashchenko and Australia's Eleanor Patterson tied for the bronze.\n\nCunningham narrowly qualified for the Paris Olympics, but entered ranked No. 7 in the world. She recorded finishes of 13th at the Rio Games in 2016 and sixth at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\n\"I felt good about my performance. I was happy when I made the bar and when I missed the bar, I knew what I was doing wrong,\" Cunningham said. \"I just need to go back to the drawing board and work on a few things.\"\n\nAsked if she's committed to making a run at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, Cunningham said, \"Absolutely. I'm only going to be 30 years old, guys.\" - Chase Goodbread\n\nWeather forecast for 100 final\n\nThere is no rain in the forecast for the men's 100 final.

With a time of 9.79 seconds, Lyles crossed the finish line in a dramatic photo finish, edging out Kishane Thompson and Fred Kerley. The moment of triumph was not only a personal achievement for Lyles but also a significant milestone for American sprinting, as he became the first American to win the Olympic gold in the men's 100 meters since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nNoah Lyles' rise to the pinnacle of sprinting has been nothing short of extraordinary. Born on July 18, 1997, in Gainesville, Florida, Lyles showed early signs of his athletic prowess. His parents, Keisha Caine and Kevin Lyles, were both competitive athletes, which perhaps laid the foundation for his future success. Growing up in a family that valued sports, Lyles and his younger brother Josephus, who is also a sprinter, were encouraged to pursue their athletic ambitions from a young age.\n\nLyles attended T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, where he began to make a name for himself in track and field. His impressive performances in high school competitions caught the attention of scouts and led to a scholarship offer from the University of Florida. However, Lyles decided to turn professional straight out of high school, signing with Adidas in 2016. This bold move set the stage for his rapid ascent in the world of professional sprinting.\n\nLyles' journey to the Paris Olympics was marked by numerous victories and setbacks. He first burst onto the international scene in 2016, when he won gold in the 200 meters at the World U20 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland. This victory was a precursor to his future dominance in the sport. However, his path was not without challenges. Injuries and the pressure of living up to the high expectations often tested his resolve.\n\nIn 2018, Lyles established himself as a force to be reckoned with by winning the Diamond League title in both the 100 meters and 200 meters. His charismatic personality and unique fashion sense, often sporting colorful hair and eclectic outfits, made him a fan favorite. But it was his performance on the track that truly set him apart. In 2019, he won gold in the 200 meters at the World Championships in Doha, Qatar, solidifying his status as one of the world's top sprinters.\n\nThe atmosphere at Stade de France was electric on the night of the 100 meters final. Fans from around the world had gathered to witness the showdown of the fastest men on the planet. The anticipation was palpable as the athletes took their positions on the starting blocks. Lyles, with his trademark focus and determination, was ready to seize the moment.\n\nAs the starting gun fired, the sprinters exploded off the blocks. The race was neck-and-neck, with Lyles, Thompson, and Kerley matching each other stride for stride. The tension reached its peak as they approached the finish line, with no clear winner in sight. It was only after a few agonizing moments of photo review that Lyles was declared the winner, his time of 9.79 seconds cementing his place in history.\n\nThe reaction to Lyles' victory was immediate and overwhelming. Social media platforms were flooded with messages of congratulations and admiration. Celebrities, fellow athletes, and fans from around the world praised Lyles for his incredible achievement. His victory was seen as a triumph not only for himself but also for American sprinting, which had been longing for a new champion in the men's 100 meters.\n\nOne notable fan reaction came from Usain Bolt, the legendary sprinter and former world record holder in the 100 meters. Bolt took to Twitter to congratulate Lyles, calling him the \"next big thing\" in sprinting. This endorsement from one of the greatest sprinters of all time added an extra layer of significance to Lyles' victory.\n\nIn his post-race interviews, Lyles was emotional as he reflected on his journey and the support he had received along the way. He dedicated his win to his family, coaches, and fans, emphasizing the importance of their unwavering belief in him. Lyles also spoke about the challenges he had faced, including dealing with injuries and the mental pressure of competing at the highest level. His candid and heartfelt words resonated with many, further endearing him to fans worldwide.\n\nNoah Lyles' victory in the 100 meters at the Paris Olympics is more than just a personal achievement; it represents a new era in sprinting. His success has inspired a new generation of athletes to pursue their dreams with passion and determination. Lyles' journey from a young boy with big dreams to the fastest man in the world is a testament to the power of perseverance and hard work.\n\nLyles' influence extends beyond the track. His vibrant personality, distinctive style, and commitment to using his platform for positive change have made him a role model for many. He has been vocal about issues such as mental health, racial equality, and the importance of staying true to oneself. His advocacy and authenticity have earned him respect and admiration from fans and fellow athletes alike.\n\nAs Noah Lyles basks in the glory of his Olympic gold medal, the future looks incredibly bright. He has expressed his desire to continue competing at the highest level and to break more records. With his combination of speed, charisma, and determination, there is no doubt that Lyles will continue to be a dominant force in the world of sprinting.\n\nFans eagerly await his next races and the possibility of witnessing more historic moments. For now, however, they celebrate his incredible achievement in Paris and the excitement he has brought to the sport of track and field. Noah Lyles, the world's fastest man, has etched his name in the annals of Olympic history, and his legacy will undoubtedly inspire generations to come.\n\nNoah Lyles' victory in the 100 meters at the Paris Olympics is a momentous occasion in the world of athletics. His journey, marked by determination, resilience, and unwavering support, has culminated in a triumph that will be remembered for years to come. As he continues to blaze a trail on and off the track, Noah Lyles stands as a shining example of what can be achieved through hard work, passion, and the belief that anything is possible.", "source":

It was not easy, as the photos would show.\n\nThe win would come down to a photo finish separated by just thousandths of a second (he beat the silver medalist, Kishane Thompson, by .005 seconds, and the bronze medalist, Fred Kerley of the U.S. by .02 seconds). The competition matched the hype of the moment.\n\nAfter the race, it was too close to call with a naked eye. Broadcasters called it wrong. Fans watching at home called it wrong. Even Lyles called it wrong.\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated senior writer Greg Bishop, who was on-site to tell the story, Lyles approached Thompson after the 10-second event and said, \"Hey, man,\" Lyles told him, \"I think you got it.\"\n\nOf course, no one is happier to be wrong in this instance than Lyles.\n\nLyles came to win this race and announce himself to the world. Mission accomplished. He took bronze in the 200m at Tokyo. Left for Lyles at these Games is the 2024 200m and the 4x100m relay.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Even Noah Lyles Thought Kishane Thompson Won 100m.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_wilson@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Josh Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/emqwzv/picture290746359/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/417c5caa-a716-4cc0-b4a0-85127afd7671", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He managed to pull off a win in razor-thin fashion, after he started out slow in the blocks in Sunday's 100-meter dash final. In bringing home the gold medal, Lyles became the first American to win the event in 20 years. Lyles finished with a time of 9.79 seconds, barely edging out Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\nOnce he won, Lyles had to go into the stands to hug his mother, who was there for the special occasion.\n\nIn a finish for the ages in the 100-meter dash, America's Noah Lyles narrowly edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second to take the gold medal.\n\nIt was as much of a photo finish as there's been in the Olympics in years. And even with the photo it's somewhat hard to determine the winner at the finish.\n\nThe finish was so close that Lyles and Thompson spent an agonizingly long few seconds simply looking up at the scoreboard with their hands on their head after the race, waiting for the winner to be announced.\n\nNoah Lyles' reaction to bringing home the gold medal\n\nWhen Lyles learned he had won, he reacted jubilantly, bouncing up and down the track, taking his pinned USA label from the front of his jersey and holding it up to the crowd. He then turned to the camera and yelled, \"America, I told you!\"\n\nNoah Lyles posted a 9.78-second time in the event to take home the gold.\n\nHe needed every bit of it, too. That was something he might not necessarily have factored in when he initially arrived in Paris, perhaps just a touch overconfident.\n\nLyles ran a 10.04 second time in qualifying, watching some finish ahead of him. He remarked afterward that he was surprised by the level of competition.\n\n\"These boys said they ain't coming to play,\" Lyles said, via ESPN. \"And I guess that's my first lesson in underestimating the power of an Olympics. When somebody's on the line, they say they're going to give it their all or nothing.\n\n\"The plan was first. But it didn't happen. Second is fine. We'll make sure from here on out it's first ... Now I don't have to hold back.\"\n\nNoah Lyles certainly held nothing back in the final of the 100-meter dash, running a blazing time to secure the gold medal. Now he'll get the chance to add to his tally by taking the 200-meter dash, an event he also had circled coming into Paris.\n\nLyles was the reigning 100-meter dash World Champion and took home a bronze medal in the 200-meter dash during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He eventually won a title at the World Championships in that event in 2022 and 2023, in addition to the 100-meter dash.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wade_peery@on3.com", "name": "Wade Peery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/08/04153533/noah-lyles-paris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Lyles had his first shot at Olympic immortality today with the 100-meter.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS: Follow USA TODAY's full coverage here\n\nThe finals were not Lyles' first race of the day, though. The 100-meter semifinals took place earlier today as well, with Lyles finishing second in his heat, two-hundredths of a second off the winner, Jamaica's Oblique Seville (9.81). That result spawned this viral picture of Lyles eyeing down the man who beat him.\n\nAnother Jamaican, Kishane Thompson, also ran a 9.8 in the semifinals to seed himself above Lyles. Still, despite having not won either of the two qualifying races leading up to the finals, Lyles was still a popular pick to win gold.\n\nHere's how the race played out.\n\nOlympics News: Stephen Nedoroscik won bronze for pommel horse, and then went viral\n\nThe race was tremendously close. Not even the announcers knew who won, thinking that Thompson earned the win on initial viewing. But it was Lyles who barely edged out every other racer. Even on repeat views in slow motion, it was hard to determine just when Lyles finished compared to the other athletes.\n\nFirst-, second- and third-place finishers win gold, silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nLyles' win gave America its first gold in the 100-meter since Justin Gatlin at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

Thompson came out hot, pushed by American Fred Kerley, but it was Lyles who ran them down on the outside to win gold in a photo finish by an outrageous five thousandths of a second.\n\nBoth Lyles and Thompson ran 9.79, but Lyles did it in 9.784, while Thompson was 9.789 -- with a reminder the timing is to your torso, not your feet.\n\nKerley finished in bronze medal position with a 9.81, while South Africa's Akani Simbane missed out on a medal by the narrowest of margins, running a 9.82. It was a truly incredible race and the tension only built in the immediate aftermath, as all three medalists stared up at the board waiting for official results to come through, as Thompson thought he had won, thinking Kerley was closest to him not realizing Lyles was on the outside right alongside as well.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nl2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

He is three hundredths of a second down on Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and his compatriot Fred Kerley.\n\nYet, and this may sound bizarre, that is exactly where he needs to be.\n\nLyles has unmatched top-end speed. He wins like Usain Bolt used to, opening up his stride (to a ridiculous 2.5 metres) and eating up ground on others before cruising past. He holds form while they struggle and decelerate.\n\nThe headline is Lyles winning by five hundredths of a second in the closest men's 100m Olympic final ever -- and the hardest for which to qualify. Lyles (9.78) ran the fastest time in an Olympic 100m final since Bolt's Olympic record (9.63) in London back in 2012.\n\nHis victory was never in question over that final 40 metres. Lyles can close anyone. He did it in 2023 to win the World Championships and again in trials to reach Paris.\n\nThe final frontier for him to become Olympic champion was the start... so here's the story of how a 75-year-old and a stickman helped give Lyles the edge.\n\n\"Your reaction times suck,\" says Ralph Mann.\n\nIt is July 2023 and the former Olympian -- he won 400m hurdles silver at the 1972 Munich Olympics -- who holds a PhD in biomechanics, is helping to coach Lyles on his block starts.\n\nAt Lyles' training base in Clermont, Florida, Mann, now 75, has a marquee set up by the side of the track. There are a series of cameras pointed at the blocks, and a laptop running software that is going to eke the final per cent out of Lyles' starts.\n\nOver the last 40 years, Mann has watched and collected data on over 500 of the best athletes. \"We know what it takes to be an elite starter,\" he says. Mann has written an epic 300-page plus textbook on the mechanics of sprinting and hurdling. What he doesn't know isn't worth knowing.\n\nMann has applied that knowledge and decades of experience into a software, created in 1999, which generates a stickman that overlays the video of the sprinter in the blocks. Adjusted for body size and weight (to Lyles), it shows where the limbs should be as the sprinter sets and springs out the blocks. If you've ever played a Mario Kart ghost race, it's that, just applied to sprinting.\n\nThey can go frame-by-frame to see how Lyles moves compared to the most effective/efficient method, and it becomes a coaching tool for the session with real-time feedback.\n\nLyles' problems were that his hips were too far back when he set and his foot turnover was poor on the first few steps. Compared to the stickman, Lyles was not compact enough in the drive phase (as the athletes get up to speed), his feet were coming up too high between steps and his contact time (how long the feet are on the floor) was too long. The ankles weren't rigid enough, either.\n\nIn short, there was plenty to improve.\n\nIt meant that steps four to seven, which are all about extending range after getting out with the first three, would come up short compared to better starters. Mann explains to Lyles that the only way he can get faster is by reducing the time between steps and keeping contact time minimal. White tape was put horizontally across the track to give Lyles a visual representation of where he should be landing at specific steps (three and seven).\n\nLyles knows how the model works. When he asks Mann what he has set it at, he replies \"what we need to make you famous\". Lyles speaks about doing what works according to the model, in terms of his form, rather than what feels good. He has fully bought in.\n\nHe is loud and, to some, borderline arrogant, but Lyles shows vulnerability with Mann.\n\n\"Let's see your precious model beat me,\" he says, imploring Mann to set the model at better than Lyles' absolute best. \"Let it run away, let me get embarrassed,\" says Lyles. At one stage, Mann stands over Lyles in the blocks and physically moves his hips forwards in the set position. Lyles, half-joking, half-serious, says he feels like he isn't even in the blocks.\n\nThere were green shoots of this working in February.\n\nAfter losing six previous times, Lyles finally beat Christian Coleman over 60m indoors. Coleman (6.34) is the world record holder, but Lyles edged him out by one hundredth to take the U.S. indoors title in 6.43. Coleman got out faster, quicker with his foot turnover and first to reach his second step, but Lyles was in contention enough (sixth at halfway, 30m) to close hard and took it on the line -- you'll see a theme developing.\n\nFor a guy who could not break 6.5 seconds in 2023, it was huge. Coleman then beat Lyles at the World Indoors in Glasgow in March, but Lyles ran 6.47 in the semi-final and 6.44 in the final.\n\nFast forward to Paris.\n\nMann was right: Lyles' reaction times do suck, by Olympic standards anyway. He was the joint-slowest to react in the final (178ms, with Letsile Tebogo), 26th of 27 among semi-finalists (167ms) and 46 of the 70 men in the heats, who did not false start, reacted quicker (161ms).\n\nThat is one of the hardest parts to train. Nobody wants to false start in the Olympics and the 80,000 capacity Stade de France is loud. Lyles responding slower than others did not help, but it would not be the difference between gold and silver.\n\nLyles, in lane seven because he finished third in his semi-final, takes his second and third steps before Thompson in lane three. It shows great foot turnover given he was the last to get out.\n\nHis form and mechanics are good, even if he doesn't accelerate as quickly through the drive phase as the Jamaican, or Tokyo 2020 100m champion Marcell Jacobs. Lyles was last up until 40 metres, but by 30 metres was moving at the same speed as Thompson.\n\nThe 60m split is the one that matters: 6.44. Lyles is suddenly third, having jumped four places from the 50m mark, going past Marcell Jacobs (lane nine), Akani Simbine (lane five), Tobogo and Oblique Seville. The latter two are outside and inside Lyles respectively.\n\n\"I was fortunate to have Seville next to me because, all throughout the year, he's been hitting that acceleration that I wasn't hitting,\" said Lyles. \"I wasn't going to let him go.\"\n\nThough as Mann once said: \"Noah's biggest competition is Noah.\" His 60m split in the final was only one hundredth off what he managed at the U.S. Indoors. At the Paris Diamond League in June 2023, Lyles won in 9.97, going through 60m in 6.55. He saved one of his best starts ever for the final.\n\nThompson and Fred Kerley went through 60m in 6.41 seconds, but both had already well hit terminal velocity and were slowing. Lyles peaked slightly later than the pair and held form for longer, slower to decelerate.\n\nLyles' extra stride length adds up. Across the full race, Lyles (44) took one fewer step than Thompson (45). The Jamaican might dwarf Lyles for arm or leg size, but strong arms can only pull an athlete to the line a certain amount. There is no replacement for good mechanics.\n\nLyles closed the last 40 metres in 3.35 seconds, the fastest in the race. Thompson closed in 3.38. Five others, barring Simbine who finished hard in fourth, covered the last 40 metres in 3.4 seconds or slower. \"I wasn't patient enough with my speed -- I should have let it bring me to the line\" accepted Thompson.\n\nIn his book -- it's a textbook, really -- Mann lists a series of athletes as the best in certain categories. There are the most talented, the most professional, most driven and best representatives of the sport, but he puts Lyles as one of his favourites.\n\nAfter 100m gold in Paris, and a legitimate shot at doing the double with the 200m, Lyles ought to put Mann in his favourites too.\n\n\"Ralph Mann, before I left for Paris, said this is how close first and second is going to be away from each other,\" said Lyles, bringing his index finger and thumb close together to gesture an inch. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

This shamelessly extravagant showman, the self-appointed heir to Usain Bolt, is the Olympic 100m champion after one of the tensest, tightest finals ever seen.\n\nJust 12 hundredths separated first from seventh, but in the end the glittering lights of the Stade de France flashed in the red, white and blue of the United States, just as he had envisaged it. It is becoming a custom at these Olympics for athletics champions to mark their triumphs by ringing a giant bell. Lyles, rest assured, rang it for all it was worth, as if to herald the dawn of his sprint supremacy.\n\nThe winning time, 9.79 seconds, was the fastest of his life. Naturally, it paled against the 9.69 and 9.64 that Bolt ran in the first two of his three Olympic finals, but this was beside the point: Lyles had chosen these Paris Games as his moment to become an icon, and he delivered.\n\nBounding halfway down the back straight as soon as his name was announced, waggling his fingers frenziedly in the warm-up, you feared he would burn himself out before the starting gun. But he screened out all the diversions - the Jamaican threat, the ominous countdown music, the interminable hold in the blocks - to produce his finest race under the greatest strain. \"This is the one I wanted,\" he said. \"I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nSometimes Lyles' braggadocio can grate. Sometimes his habit of asking his every move to be documented by a Netflix crew can smack of a man with a Messiah complex. Now, though, he can serve up the ultimate rebuke to his critics: a first Olympic gold medal, and the undisputed status as the fastest man in the world.\n\nIt was far too close for comfort, with Lyles and Jamaica's Kishane Thompson dipping for the line in a photo finish. But the American, who takes hubris to levels at which even Bolt might have blushed, will not care one iota. His quest to be the dominant track star of his generation is proceeding exactly to plan.\n\nIt was Lyles' sheer composure that told in the end. Where Thompson, just 23, faltered over the final strides, Lyles, with six world golds already banked, hit a top speed with which nobody could live. Although he left it late - as he always does in the 100, not his specialist event - he ultimately timed his surge to perfection. Draping himself in the Stars and Stripes, he posed for the cameras as though taunting his detractors. At last, he has the prize to demonstrate why he turns up to press conferences declaring: \"The champ is here!\"\n\nWhile Lyles might not be to everybody's taste, with his ostentatious nail art and his penchant for wearing a cap that says \"Made It\" under the peak, he is essential for his sport. He is the most charismatic figure in this field by a distance, never passing up the chance to talk up his credentials as a saviour.\n\nThompson, by contrast, is young and unused to such intensity of scrutiny: after one of his heats here, he refused interviews and instead fist-bumped every interviewer with the words \"one love\". Each to his own, but Lyles understands the game. He recognises that in this of all events, the personality matters as much as the sport, and he is only too happy to fill the void.\n\nLyles said he knew this final would be resolved by the most slender margins. \"A guy in biomechanics came down before I came down and said, 'It's going to be this much, that's how close it's going to be.' And, gosh, he was right. I came with aggression, but after that 9.83 in the semi-final I was done with aggression. My sports therapist told me, 'You need to let go, you're holding on. Let go and release it.'\"\n\nHe can be a bundle of contradictions. For all the self-agrandisement, he has spoken openly of his struggles with depression and has brought no fewer than three therapists with him to Paris. With his fame having grown hugely through his Netflix exposure, he has been besieged by selfie-chasers at the athletes' village. At times, he said, he has even needed to find quiet corners of the cafeteria with his girlfriend, the Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield, to collect his thoughts. But after this crowning glory, he will bask in the glow to his heart's content.\n\nIt was a luminously high-quality final, with Louie Hinchliffe the first 100m semi-finalist in Olympic history to run under 10 seconds without making the cut. The duel had been drawn, as Lyles and Oblique Seville stared each other down over the final strides.\n\nAthletics needed a final like this, frankly, and it needed a champion like Lyles. The spectacle formed the sharpest contrast to the tumbleweed version in Tokyo three years ago, when Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs, a self-styled \"crazy long jumper\", bolted from obscurity to claim the crowd. This time, there was both a passionate crowd and a winner worthy of the occasion.\n\nLyles, you sense, is only just starting in his bid to colonise the headlines. As a 200m specialist, it is his abiding mission to hunt down Bolt's world record of 19.19. For now, though, the 100m title, the most precious of all in Olympic sport, is his. \"I hope you guys like Noah,\" he grinned, \"because I got a lot more coming.\"\n\nThe image shows that Lyles was eighth and last after 40m, made up five places by 60m and and was ahead only on the finish line.\n\nThompson led from 30m and lost it on the line. Kerley had silver up to 80m before Lyle's storming finish.\n\nIn June, Seville beat Lyles during the 100m in the Racers Grand Prix held in Kingston, Jamaica. Seville stared down Lyles at the finish line as they crossed.\n\nHe said he was coming to build a legacy and to win three gold medals. Plenty of schadenfreude was waiting for him but he backed up his braggadocio.\n\nIt was a world record time for fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth places.\n\nLyles, Simbine and Jacobs (the defending champions) all ran personal bests.\n\nAmazing catch-up by Lyles after Thompson perhaps became preoccupied with Kerley outside him. He wins by five-thousandths of a second.\n\nThat's one of the closest finals we've seen, 12 hundredths of a second between first and last place.\n\nHe somehow made it from fourth to first in the last 20m and both men reciorded 9.79:\n\nAfter being held on the start line for a good two minutes longer than necessary. Too long a build-up. The sprinters are getting frustrated as we wait for the music to end. Is that the reason for the delay? Blimey. Into the blocks at last.\n\nThompson starts like a train but Lyles powers through at the end to make it look like a dead heat. Photo finish. Oddly Seville was a victim of nominative determinism and leant back at the finish which cost him a number of places.\n\nThompson had that won but seemed to think he only had to beat Kerley and hadn't bargained for Lyles' explosive finish.\n\nComes out with his arms crossed like a West Ham fan then yells and enacts the moment Dr David Banner turns into the Hulk. Noah Lyles also roars and then bounces 30m up the track, pogoing away and shouting 'Yeah!'\n\nKenny Bednarek jumped the gun... on his entrance. Hopefully for the last time tonight.\n\nTo soundtrack the light show at Stade de France. Enjoyin the lights racing up the purple 100m straight.\n\n'The time is now,' he says. And we see footage of The Fastest Men on the Planet\u2122 played to a shonky cover version of Time After Time.\n\nMichael Johnson goes for Thompson, Jess Ennis-Hill exposes herself to splinters and says Jamaica and Denise Lewis splits the difference and plumps for Oblique (/) Seville.\n\nJust skimming through the exchanges and it appears that Kishane Thompson is the overwhelming favourite now at a best priced 4-6. Noah Lyles, favourite yesterday, is now as long as 5-2 and Oblique Seville is 14-1.\n\nThompson is 23, ran his PB, 9.77sec, in the Jamaica trials and has been tipped all week by Usain Bolt to win for the Rock.\n\nYou can follow all the action from the track and field with Richard Aikman over here.\n\nHughes was fifth with 10.01. Richardson doesn't make the final.\n\n\"That's his level at the moment and he's had a very good Olympics but there's lots more to come.\"\n\nAnd both Jacobs and Bednarek beat Hinchliffe's mark so he won't make the final.\n\nHinchliffe was some way back in third with 9.97. Waiting game for him.\n\nSeville was sharp out of the blocks and looked like he was easing up. Hinchliffe did not have the best start but powered through. Lyles looks like he might still have something in the tank, too.\n\nThe first two qualify and the two next quickest across the three semis.\n\nLyles runs his palm down his mouth when introduced. I have to admit I don't get the reference. My first thought was something obscene but I'm not sure that's what it was about.\n\nA recap of the five fastest this year\n\nWhat do I admire the most? The technical expertise he has shared for 24 years but also the perspective. He is never coaxed towards hyperbole. He assesses everyone on their merits and puts their achievement into a broad global and historical context. He provides a sharp contrast with other BBC athletics experts.\n\nHow Paris Olympics developed one of the world's fastest tracks - using mussel shells\n\nThe Olympic record FYI is Usain Bolt's 9.63sec from London 2012, the world record is also his, 9.58sec from the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.\n\nZharnel Hughes: Flight simulator and Usain Bolt have helped my shot at Olympic glory\n\nHence St Lucia had to wait until tonight for this moment:\n\nGood evening and welcome to live coverage of the men's 100m final at 8.50pm preceded by the three semi-finals at 7.05pm to establish those who will go on to compete for the blue riband of men's athletics, the claims of the 1,500m partisans notwithstanding. Two team GB athletes go in the semi-finals, the national record holder Zharnel Hughes is in the third having qualified 10th fastest in 10.03, three-hundredths of a second off his best for the season. Hughes won his semi-final in Tokyo in 9.98 three years ago but, you may well recall, false-started in the final from lane four and was disqualified.\n\nThe second British semi-fnalist is Louie Hinchliffe from Sheffield who has been taken under the wing of the great Carl Lewis at the University of Houston. Hinchliffe, all but unknown until his emergence at the NCAA championships this year, is the third fastest qualifier with 9.98 in yesterday's heats, again three-hundredths of a second off his best for the season. He has a remarkable body shape for an elite sprinter, more of a bustler than a glider, but he generates so much power and his technique is ever more refined by the month. It would be a remarkable story for him even to make the final but his form is good enough to make it a probability.\n\nThe world champion, Noah Lyles, is alongside Hinchliffe in the first semi-final and ran a personal best 9.81 only 15 days ago at London's Olympic Stadium in the Diamond League so we shouldn't read too much into yesterday's 10.04. Ferdinand Omnayala of Kenya and Jamaica's Kishane Thompson have both gone under 9.8sec this season while USA's Fred Kerley, silver medallist in Tokyo and the quickest man in the field with a PB of 9.76, has run under 9.9sec. Defending champion, Marcell Jacobs of Italy, crept in with 10.05 but has run 9.92 this season as he makes his way back from injury.\n\nIf you are of the hat-wearing persuasion, hang on to it.",

In the men's 100m race on Sunday, Lyles just barely came out on top, defeating Jamaica runner Kishane Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles pulled off this win despite being in last place nearly halfway through the race. But he closed in on his opponents towards the end and on a last-second lean, he just passed the finish line in first.\n\nBBC commentator and USA Olympic legend Michael Johnson was calling the race. At first glance, many thought Thompson finished first, but Johnson knew it was Lyles all along.\n\n\"It was Noah. It's Noah,\" Johnson kept repeating.\n\nIn the 100m semifinal, Lyles went viral for his taunt of Oblique Seville as he crossed the finish line. Seville beat Lyles by 0.02 seconds, but both qualified for the final. In the final, Lyles won gold, while Seville came in last place.\n\nLyles now has a total of two Olympic medals in his career. His first came in the 200m race in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where he won bronze. Lyles will get another chance at a medal on Monday, August 5, in the Paris Games' 200m race.\n\nJohnson won four gold medals back in the 1990s. The sprinting legend won the 4x400m relay in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the 200m and 400m races in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and the 400m race in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Johnson would have had a fifth gold medal in the 2000 4x400m race had his teammates not tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nRelated: Fans In Disbelief Over Slow-Mo Video Of Noah Lyles' Olympic Finish\n\nRelated: Simone Biles Reveals Major Anxiety She Is Dealing With At Olympics", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handball at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball_at_the_1996_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-enhancing_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Performance-enhancing substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1157, "textEnd": 1165}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNoah Lyles managed to become an Olympic gold medalist by the slimmest possible margin.\n\nLyles took home the gold in the men's 100-meter race at the Paris Games on Sunday in a thrilling photo finish. With a time of 9.784 seconds, Lyles beat out silver medalist Kishane Thompson of Jamaica (9.789 seconds) by a mere five-thousandths of a second. Fellow American Fred Kerley rounded out the podium with a time of 9.81 seconds to win bronze.\n\nMany viewers were confused though because the photo finish revealed that Thompson's foot had actually crossed the finish line before Lyles' did. As a result, FS1's Emmanuel Acho, who lettered in track in high school, clarified things in a post to X. The reason why Lyles won the race, Acho explained, is because the clock stops when the runner's torso crosses the finish line. The first body part to cross the line does NOT determine the winner.\n\nInterestingly enough, Thompson would have been the gold-medal winner had he leaned in with his chest at the finish line like Lyles did (which the above photo shows that Thompson did not do). That is how absolutely narrow the margins can be in Olympic competition.\n\nThe razor-thin victory by Lyles, who already won bronze in the 200m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, did admittedly throw many people off. Even the NBC announcer calling the race live mistakenly thought that Thompson had won.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Acho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Acho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noah-lyles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: James Lang-USA TODAY Sports Credit - James Lang -- USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\nNoah Lyles, the world's fastest man, won a gold medal in the 100-m final on Sunday in a race that came down to a remarkable photo finish.\n\nThe meet was decided by just .005 seconds, as NBC commentators originally declared Jamaica's Kishane Thompson as the winner. \"I went up to him afterward, while we were waiting. I even said, 'Bro I think you got that one, big dog,\" NBC reports that Lyles told Thompson before the scoreboard revealed that the Florida native crossed the finish line with a time of 9.784 seconds. Thompson, the silver medalist, did so in 9.789. Team USA's Fred Kerley followed closely at 9.81 seconds, securing the bronze.\n\nRead More: The Inside Story of How Noah Lyles Pulled Off That Incredible 100-M Win\n\nIn track and field, the end of an athlete's lap is determined by the moment their torso crosses the finish line. While it may appear that other competitors' feet reached the finish line first, the photo displays Lyles, in lane seven, with his chest meeting the mark.\n\nThis victory was undoubtedly fueled by Lyles' finish in 2021, when the 27-year-old was unsatisfied after he took home bronze in Tokyo. After that point, the track-and-field star became even more determined. \"I'm here to race anybody who wants it,\" Lyles told TIME in an interviewer earlier this year. \"The deeper the field, the better I run. I know I'm going to win. Because I'm never going to break nerve.\"\n\nThis marks the first U.S. gold in this event since 2004.\n\nLyles is also hoping to medal in the 200m race, for which he is the favorite.

He's America's first gold medalist in the 100 meters in 20 years since Justin Gatlin won at the 2004 Athens Olympics.\n\nThompson took silver with a 9.789. Fred Kerley, who won silver in the Tokyo Olympics, added a bronze to his resume with a personal best time of 9.81. Five of the top six times were personal bests, a season best, or a national record. Oblique Seville ran a 9.91 and finished last.\n\nThe 27-year-old said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys assured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles recounted as he pinched his thumb and forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nComputers showed Lyles leaned forward -- his torso had to cross the finish line -- to cross the line five-thousandths of a second faster than Thompson.\n\nBefore the final results were posted, Lyles told reporters he thought it was Thompson who finished first, not him.\n\n\"I was like, oh man, I'm really gonna have to swallow my pride, which I don't have a problem doing. Respect deserves respect, and everybody in the field, to be honest, came out knowing that they could win this race.\"\n\nPreviously, Lyles talked about wanting more spirited competition with his cohorts. More trash-talking. More races. More of the best facing off.\n\n\"Everybody has their own vibe. I'm a showman,\" Lyles declared in the documentary series Sprint on Netflix.\n\n\"I feel like almost an artistic director. You have all these other athletes as stars, rock stars, popular wherever they go. Track and field needs to be the same. And I'm not gonna be happy until I see that accomplished.\"\n\nAnd it's not just trash talk with his track and field competitors. Lyles and the NBA -- players and fans -- have had some beef since he spoke at last year's World Championships in which he won the 100 and 200.\n\nLyles mocked the league's labeling of its NBA Finals winners as \"world champions\" by openly asking, \"World champion of what? The United STATES?\"\n\n\"That ain't the world,\" he continued amid laughter from reporters. \"That is not the world. We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show that they're represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA.\"\n\nNBA players and media didn't find Lyles' ridicule so amusing. They argued that the league comprises the best basketball players from around the globe and is therefore the best hoops competition on the planet despite not being an official world championship.\n\nLyles' comments sparked a firestorm of criticism and clap-backs. Kevin Durant tweeted: \"Somebody help this brother.\" ESPN's Stephen A. Smith called Lyles \"flagrantly ignorant.\"\n\nFast forward to Saturday and the start of the men's 100 competition at Stade de France. Lyles finished second in his first-round heat, and his many detractors tweeted their delight about his potential downfall in Paris. He took second again in his semifinal early Sunday, giving his critics more hope.\n\nLyles ended up having the last laugh. And he has the chance to win three more golds to match Carl Lewis' track and field record of four golds at the 1984 Olympic Games. He'll be an even bigger favorite to win his next event -- the 200 meters.\n\n\"I'll be winning,\" Lyles guaranteed. \"None of them is winning. When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.\" Lyles was referring to his opponents in the 200. But we don't think Lyles plans on eating any of his words anytime soon.\n\n\"I'm a true believer that the moment isn't bigger than me,\" Lyles said on Netflix. \"The moment was made for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Figure_Skating_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Figure Skating Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

According to the Associated Press, Lyles' .005-second lead was one of the closest sprints in the Games' history.\n\nTeam USA's Fred Kerley claimed the bronze with a time of 9.81 seconds.\n\nDespite a slow start off the blocks, Lyles picked up the pace down the stretch in Paris' Stade de France to secure his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nLyles is the first American to win gold in the 100-meter event since Justin Gatlin in 2004.

In a news conference after the championship, Lyles made headlines for criticizing the NBA.\n\nLyles previously won a bronze medal in the 200-meter sprint at the Tokyo Olympics.

Thompson was credited with the same time but had to settle for silver, Lyles winning by just five-thousandths of a second. Lyles' USA teammate, Fred Kerley completed the podium, grabbing bronze in 9.81.\n\nThompson looked a winner for most of the race. Even Lyles thought his Jamaican rival had done enough for gold, almost congratulating him as they waited on the result to show up on the giant scoreboard.\n\n\"I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, I think you got that one.' But then my name popped up, and I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm amazing'.\"\n\nIt was truly an amazing run from Lyles, the showman clawing his way back following a very ordinary start.\n\nThough there was no Trinidad and Tobago representation in the Olympic century final, at least two members of the Team TTO contingent here in Paris would be pleased to see Lyles at the top of the podium at today's victory ceremony.\n\nLike Lyles, men's 400m semifinalist Jereem \"The Dream\" Richards is part of the Lance Brauman camp, while TTO sprint coach Keston Bledman is an assistant to head coach Brauman at the training group's Florida base.\n\nLyles is a colourful character, his outgoing personality drawing a great deal of attention to track and field. Among the spectators in the stadium yesterday were famous American rapper Snoop Dog and NBA superstar Jayson Tatum.\n\n\"I had so many commercials going around and so many people, like Snoop Dog is out here, saying that I'm going to be the one. I'm not going to say it's not pressure,\" Lyles continued, \"it's definitely pressure. Saying that the moment is not bigger than me, that the moment was meant for me, constantly saying that it's going to be the thing I need.\"\n\nLyles handled the pressure well, leading home the first wind-legal race in history with eight men under ten seconds.\n\nSouth African Akani Simbine finished fourth in a national record time of 9.82. Italy's defending Olympic champion Lamont Jacobs was fifth in 9.85, with sixth spot going to Letsile Tebogo in 9.86--a new Botswana record. American Kenny Bednarek and Jamaican Oblique Seville were seventh and eighth, respectively, clocking 9.88 and 9.91.\n\nSeville had sent a semi-final warning, winning the opening heat in 9.81 seconds with Lyles second in 9.83. Simbine topped heat two in 9.87. Only Thompson was faster than Seville in the penultimate round of the Olympic Games blue riband event, taking heat three in 9.80, ahead of Kerley, the runner-up in 9.84.\n\nLyles and Thompson improved in the championship race. Seville, though, did not, and had to settle for the cellar position. Thompson said he was pleased to secure a podium finish.\n\n\"I'm super grateful. I came out here and finished injury-free. I think you guys know my past issues with injuries. I am a bit disappointed, but I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here. I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learnt from it.\n\n\"I'm feeling very good,\" Thompson continued. \"My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad. I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold, everybody loves winners. I would have loved to win today, but big up to the whole field.\"\n\nKerley said that though gold was his goal, bronze was \"special\".\n\n\"This is the Olympic Games we are talking about.

I even said, 'Bro I think you got that one, big dog,\" NBC reports that Lyles told Thompson before the scoreboard revealed that the Florida native crossed the finish line with a time of 9.784 seconds.

While it may appear that other competitors' feet reached the finish line first, the photo displays Lyles, in lane seven, with his chest meeting the mark.\n\nThis victory was undoubtedly fueled by Lyles' finish in 2021, when the 27-year-old was unsatisfied after he took home bronze in Tokyo. After that point, the track-and-field star became even more determined. \"I'm here to race anybody who wants it,\" Lyles told TIME in an interviewer earlier this year. \"The deeper the field, the better I run.

Three years after a disappointing bronze in Tokyo and the depths of depression, Lyles won the 100-meter final at the Paris Olympics in a photo finish over silver medalist Kishane Thompson of Jamaica and bronze medalist Fred Kerley. On the score board, Lyles and Thompson both saw 9.79 seconds. On the official clock, it was Lyles 9.784, Thompson 9.789.\n\nWith the fastest 100 meters of his life, Lyles had bagged the first of what he plans to be three gold medals this week. Lyles has already won the hardest of his three races, against an electric field in which every sprinter finished in 9.91 seconds or faster. He has won 27 consecutive 200-meter races, and the United States is a heavy favorite in the 4x100-meter relay.\n\nBefore the race, Lyles beat his chest and begged the roaring crowd for more noise. Afterward, he ran to the crowd and hugged his mother, Keisha Caine Bishop, who when Lyles was a child would sleep sitting up and back-to-back with her son so he could ease his asthma.\"You so blessed, Noah,\" Caine Bishop told him. \"I'm so glad. I'm so glad. I'm so proud.\"\n\nLyles entered the Paris Games as the reigning world champion and seemingly in peak form. He won the U.S. Olympic trials 100 meters in 9.83 seconds, then lowered his personal best to 9.81 seconds at a Diamond League meet in London two weeks before the Olympics. With justification, he targeted a time in the 9.7s.\n\nplayPlay now\n\nNaN min\n\nFollow on\n\nPodcast episode\n\nSpotify\n\nApple\n\nGoogle\n\nAmazon\n\nOnce in Paris, though, Lyles struggled with the Olympic environment. In two separate media briefings, Lyles raised his discomfort with the recognition he drew in the Athletes Village, saying he at times resorted to wearing a hat and glasses when he left his room. In Saturday's first-round heat, Lyles started slow, ran even with the pack and finished second to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe, the current NCAA champion.\n\nLyles vowed he would learn from his casual effort, and he righted himself Sunday evening. He finished second in his semifinal heat in 9.83 seconds, tied for the second-best time of his career.

That's serious. I want a sneaker.\n\n'There's no money in spikes, there's money in sneakers. Even Michael Johnson didn't own a sneaker.\n\nNoah Lyles (right) and Kishane Thompson nervously waited for the winner of the 100m\n\n'The amount of medals we bring back, the notoriety we get, the fact that that didn't happen, I think that's crazy. It has to happen.'\n\nLyles ran a personal best of 9.79 seconds to win his first Olympic gold medal, but he was only declared the winner in a photo finish, with him admitting he thought Thompson had beaten him.\n\n\"After the race, while we were still waiting for the names, I came up to Kishane and said, 'I think you have a big dog,'\" Lyles said.\n\n\"When my name came up, I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm amazing.' I wasn't ready to see my name.\"\n\nLyles is now confident he can confirm his 100m title with victories in the 200m and the 4x100m relay, just as he did at the world championships.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure, I can't lie,\" he said. \"I'm going to win.

The journey started after 2021 when I got the bronze medal and I said, 'I have to change.'\n\n'Now I'm going around as an Olympic champion. I have that title as the fastest man in the world. This has been years of work.\n\n\"This is the one I wanted. I wanted to prove that I am the man among them all.

Noah Lyles talked an awful lot of talk in the build-up to Paris 2024, but he backed up the bluster with a late, late burst on the Stade de France track, surging past the field to pip them all on the line. There can be no argument now. \"What's the title of the Olympic champion?\" Lyles said, referring to the 'fastest man on the planet' tag that goes with gold. \"Amen.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter that he didn't get near the world record he said he'd break, finishing in 9.79; or that it came down to five thousandths of a second, quicker than the time it takes the human eye to blink; or that he finished second in his heat and his semi-final too. Lyles delivered when it mattered most.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson had been burdened with the title of heir to Usain Bolt after running the fastest time this year, and he led for 99m of this race. But Lyles fought back from dead last at 40m, and they crossed the line together.\n\nThompson roared in celebration but his face dropped when the giant screen displayed \"photo finish\" by his name. They stared up from purgatory, waiting for the verdict.\n\n\"Kishane, I think you got it, man,\" Lyles told Thompson, with a pat on the shoulder.\n\nThompson looked pained. \"Come on, man!\" he shouted at the screen, urging it to move. \"Come on, man!\"\n\nLyles paced with his hands on his head. Then the result came and Lyles was off again, one moment ripping the name from his chest and raising it to the gods, the next streaking across the hammer field with the stars and stripes flapping in the wind. Thompson was awarded silver as Lyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze.\n\n\"I was prepared to see his name pop up,\" Lyles said. \"I saw my name pop up and I said, 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible'. It's the one I wanted. It's the hard battle, the amazing opponents, everybody was healthy and came to fight. I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nLyles is the closest thing athletics has right now to a global superstar. He was placed front and centre of the Netflix documentary Sprint, which aimed to sprinkle a little of the Drive to Survive magic in athletics' direction. It is a sport always fighting attention, for a more permanent place in the entertainment-scape.\n\nHe embraced the role with extreme main-character energy. \"I'm the third fastest human to ever live,\" he bragged in one of the opening scenes. \"Soon to be the first.\"\n\nHis swagger was not always endearing but it was undeniably compelling. He spoke with raw honesty about the torment of failing in the spotlight, and about the depression he suffered. So when he looked into the camera and said he would become Olympic champion, you knew he meant it.\n\nAnother quote ran: \"I'm a true believer that the moment isn't bigger than me, the moment was made for me.\"\n\nWell, this was his moment. The US prides itself on its dominance in track and field but an American had not won this race for 20 years, not since Justin Gatlin in Athens. Bolt won the next three in Beijing, London and Rio before Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs stunned the world in Tokyo. Jacobs finished fifth here in 9.85 sec, behind South Africa's Akani Simbine who came fourth in 9.82.\n\nOne by one, Lyles picked them all off.\n\n\"It was hard for me to picture where we were, and I guess that was a good thing,\" he said. \"I was fortunate to have [Jamaica's] Oblique Seville next to me because all throughout the year he's been hitting that acceleration that I wasn't hitting. I wasn't going to let him go.\"\n\nThompson hoped to be the first Jamaican man since Bolt to win a global 100m title.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" he said. \"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and myself, I should have let my speed bring me to the line. I've learned from it. I couldn't see Noah, but I think he could see me and said, 'hey, Kishane, I thought you got it'. But he was too far to my right so I wasn't sure. This is my closest race. It was that close.\"\n\nFor Lyles, this could be just the start. He still has the 200m to come, his strongest event, as well as a 4x100m showdown with the Jamaicans.\n\n\"There's plenty more,\" he promised. \"I hope you guys like Noah because I've got a lot more coming.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki",

I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles' victory was only confirmed after a photo-finish.\n\nThe American said of the wait for the final results: \"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, bro, I think you had that one'.\n\n\"And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nLyles' U.S. teammate Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81 seconds, just one-hundredth ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who timed 9.82 seconds.\n\nIn an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85 seconds, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86 seconds, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88 seconds and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91 seconds.\n\nStarting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern.\n\nHead tucked down through to the 40-meter mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way.\n\nAs Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters made the final adjustments to their starting blocks.\n\nThe lights were then shut off, the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum.\n\nEach sprinter was individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 meters down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.\n\nAsked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt.\n\n\"100 percent,\" he said. \"That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to take it to the 200.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He's a stunning redemption story.", "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France -- Every gimmick, every cry for attention, every time he set himself up to be a meme and ridiculed, it made you wonder if Noah Lyles knew what he was getting himself into, what laid in wait on the other side of another stink bomb in Paris. It wouldn't have been the end of the world. Life would have gone on. He would have continued to get sponsors, be famous, sprint around the world and live the life he wants.\n\nBut it would have felt so transparently like an act - and one that few would have had an appetite to see continue another four years.\n\nAmericans have been intrigued by Lyles, they've been entertained by Lyles, they've been bombarded with Lyles in every way, shape and form leading up to these Olympics.\n\nBut until Sunday here at Stade de France they've had little reason at the Olympics to do anything but roll their eyes at Lyles.\n\nThat all changed with a well-timed dip. With a fortunate lean. With a few thousands of a second.\n\nOne of the biggest trash talkers in American sports is now one of its biggest heroes. He ended a 20-year drought in the 100 meters. He officially buried his Tokyo flop. He won the gold.\n\nRedemption, anyone?\n\n\"Oh, I knew once the year started, that this was not 2021,\" Lyles said. \"I knew every step of the way it was not 2021. I'm still constantly moving forward, moving forward, moving forward. And I knew that when the time came for me to be able to say, 'This is the final, this is where I need to put together.' I was going to do it.\"\n\nBut he had to actually do it. And until literally the final stride, that seemed like it might not be possible.\n\nLyles didn't win his preliminary heats. He looked like he might be off his game here in Paris. Others were in better form, and maybe, just maybe, all the pressure he heaped on himself trying to be Noah Lyles the transcendent superstar, rather than Noah Lyles the world's best sprinter, might be getting to him on the stage you only get once every four years.\n\nHere's what I thought during introductions for the 100 when Lyles came hopping out of the tunnel and running almost at a full sprint for 20 yards or so: He's trying too hard. Lyles always tries too hard.\n\nA lot of people who don't really know much about track would have only known the following things about Lyles. He talked about winning three gold medals in Tokyo, but only came away with one bronze. His focus shift to the 100 and the \"world's fastest man\" moniker felt even more audacious. And, in a major pop culture faux pas, he went after NBA players for calling themselves \"world champions\" after winning the title because the NBA is a league and the world is the world.\n\nAgain, trying too hard. Making himself the country's most annoying literalist. But also making himself famous.\n\nWhere one side of that coin begins and the other ends in this social media era, who can say? If Muhammad Ali had Twitter and YouTube instead of Howard Cosell, it might have gotten a little old too.\n\nBut if you can back it up on the track? That's the jackpot of American zeitgeist.\n\nLyles knew it. He believed it. Then he did it. And even after all that talk, it stunned him a little bit he when it actually happened and his name flashed first.\n\n\"I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't ready to see it,\" he said. \"And that's the first time I've ever, like, said that in my head, like, I wasn't ready to see it.\"\n\nPeople like Lyles usually see themselves dominating. Putting on a show because it's all a show.\n\nAnd it was indeed that, just a different kind than what anyone could have predicted.\n\nHalfway through he looked dead in the water. Then the gap closed.\n\n\"When I saw where he was at 60, I was like 'OK, we're in the mix,'\" his coach Lance Brauman said. \"But I thought at 80, I was like, 'Holy cow, he's right there.'\"\n\nThe finish was blur. It seemed like nearly the entire field hit the line together.\n\n\"Probably one of the best races I've been in in a long time,\" Fred Kerley said. \"It came down to whoever can dip the best at the last two meters.\"\n\nFor several seconds, there was a hush.\n\nNo names were coming up on the scoreboard. The result of the biggest race of Lyles' life was in suspended animation. He figured Jamaica's Kishane Thompson probably had it.\n\n\"I went up to him after where we were waiting,\" Lyles said. \"I even said, 'Bro, I think you got that one, big dog.\"\n\nThe stakes here were higher than a gold medal. He doesn't want to just be a sprinter, he wants to be a star. Those two things could only coexist if he hit the line first.

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\"\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had [him] cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Tolan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Tolan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silvio Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allan Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/04/id5699619-Noah-Lyles-AP24217725112364-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Every runner knows the torso marks the finish of a race, not the first body part to cross the line, a rule followed for years. The 100m final at the Paris Olympics saw the fastest race ever, with all eight competitors running under 10 seconds, setting a record.\n\nNoah Lyles just won arguably the greatest 100m final ever. With a time of 9.79s, he beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who also ran a 9.79s, by 0.005 seconds. Lyles wasn't the only American on the podium either, with his compatriot Fred Kerley claiming bronze and finishing just 0.02 seconds behind the Olympic champion.\n\nGiven how close the finish was, images and clips of the athletes crossing the line have gone viral. In those photos and videos, some have noticed that Lyles wasn't necessarily the first person to have a body part cross the line. Thompson and Kurley both had one of their feet cross the line before Lyles, leaving many fans confused as to why the world champion won Olympic gold.\n\nThe Ending of the 100m at Paris Olympics\n\nBut as former NFL player Emmanuel Acho explained in a post on X, formerly Twitter, it is not about whose foot crosses the line first, it is about which torso is first to the line. That was the reason Lyles became the Olympic champion. As Acho states in his post: \"Noah leans w/ his chest, while Thompson subtly concaves his chest,\" a subtle change in body position which potentially cost Thompson Olympic gold.\n\nIf the final result was to be determined by whoever's foot crossed the line first, it seems the USA still would have had gold, as it looks as if Kurley's orange shoe crossed the line before Thompson's white boot. But it has always been the way in athletics that the torso crossing the line marks the end of the race, and every runner has always known this. So, Thompson will be making no excuses and will know that his dip at the end should perhaps have been executed better.\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Key Statistic: The 100m final at the Paris Olympics was the first time ever that every athlete ran under 10 seconds.\n\nThe Jamaican, who was the favourite heading into the final, didn't have his best finish, but he did lead the race for most of the 100m distance. That shouldn't take away from Lyles' epic comeback, however. After 30m, the American was in last place, with Thompson leading the way, but of course, by the end it was Lyles who had taken the win thanks to an amazing finish from the American superstar.\n\nIn his analysis of the race, four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson said Thompson \"absolutely tightened up at the end of that race,\" a result of \"a lack of championship experience\" which was the \"only one thing that put a little bit of doubt about him.\"\n\nJohnson was also sure to praise Lyles as well, highlighting how the 100m champion is \"a great 200m runner\" with \"great speed and endurance,\" which would have been a big reason he was able to edge out Johnson at the line.\n\nFastest 100m Race of all Time\n\nMen's 100m final\n\nPosition\n\nAthlete\n\nCountry\n\nTime\n\n1.\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nUSA\n\n9.79\n\n2.\n\nKishane Thompson\n\nJAM\n\n9.79\n\n3.\n\nFred Kerley\n\nUSA\n\n9.81\n\n4.\n\nAkani Simbine\n\nRSA\n\n9.82\n\n5.\n\nLamont Jacobs\n\nITA\n\n9.85\n\n6.\n\nLetsile Tebogo\n\nBOT\n\n9.86\n\n7.\n\nKenneth Bednarek\n\nUSA\n\n9.88\n\n8.\n\nOblique Seville\n\nJAM\n\n9.91\n\nThe race might not have seen Usain Bolt's records beaten, but it was still the fastest race of all time.

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\"\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@myfox8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Tolan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Tolan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silvio Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allan Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/08/AP24217723641695.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Jamaica's Kishane Thompson looked like he had just edged Lyles until a review. The difference separating the two men was five-thousandths of a second.\n\n\"Forget the feet, it's the clavicle,\" explained NBC's Mike Tirico on what determined the difference.\n\nLyles, 27, is the reigning 100m world and U.S. champion, but had been seeking Olympic gold in the event to solidify the title of \"World's Fastest Man.\" And he got it, now the clear holder of that title.\n\nUSA's Fred Kerley finished third and won the bronze with a season-best time of 9.81 seconds.\n\nLyles did not compete in the 100m in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after finishing seventh of eight runner in the Olympics trials final, according to NBC News. He really started to focus on the 100m last year and set his sets on gold in Paris.\n\nJustin Gatlin in 2004 was the last American man to win the 100m Olympics. After that, it was Usain Bolt's race to lose in 2008, 2012 and 2016 when he won the three-peat.\n\nBolt holds the 100m Olympic record of 9.63 set in 2012 and the world record of 9.58 set in 2009.\n\nItaly's Marcell Jacobs won the 100m in 2020 with a time of 9.80. He finished in fifth this time with a time of 9.85. The USA's Kenneth Bednarek, the third American competing in the 100m in Paris, finished seventh.\n\nLyles is still expected to compete in the men's 200m starting on Tuesday and the men's 4x100m relay starting on Thursday.\n\nHe is looking to become the first man since Usain Bolt to win the 100m and 200m in the Olympics and has had his eye on Bolt's 200m world record of 19.19 set in 2009. The last American man to do the 100m-200m double gold was Carl Lewis in 1984.\n\nLyles is expected to remain a force in track and field throughout at least the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nHe signed an extension earlier this year with Adidas through the 2028 Games. Lyles' agency told NBC Olympics it's \"...the richest contract in the sport of track and field since the retirement of Usain Bolt.\" Official terms of the deal were not released.\n\nUsain Bolt holds the Olympic record time of 9.63 seconds, set in the 2012 London Games.\n\nNoah Lyles' personal best in the 100m is 9.81 seconds.\n\nNoah Lyles is expected to compete in the men's 100m, 200m, and

Races are judged on whose chest is first through the tape, with American Lyles winning by a wafer-thin margin of 0.005 seconds in a race in which he was last after 30m. Here is how he did it.\n\nLyles, predictably, had made the most eye-catching of arrivals, sprinting down as far as the 40m line when he was announced into the stadium. Plenty of people watching wondered if he should conserve some energy but, clearly wanting to be the showman that the men's 100m has lacked ever since Usain Bolt, he continued his high-energy antics.\n\nThe wait between the athletes arriving out on the track and the actual start of the race was interminable. Lengthy introductions, booming music, a spectacular light show and then darkness. That was before even the eight athletes had been called to their blocks before the silence that accompanied the starter's orders.\n\nWith Lyles's rivals having warmed themselves up with such vigour and precision on a separate track just outside the Stade de France, there was a theory that the wait might have particularly affected the two Jamaican sprinters, Oblique Seville and Thompson. They had looked capable of running so much faster in the heats and, while nerves may also have been a factor, they looked tight by comparison.\n\nLyles has never been a fast starter and, true to form, his reaction time from when the gun sounded and his feet actually left the blocks was the joint slowest in the entire field at 0.178sec. Thompson was crucially not much faster, ensuring that Fred Kerley, who was largely unfancied for gold, took an instant lead. Sprinters then vary greatly in how long they keep their heads down but this next part of the race was excellent for Thompson who, by 30m, had taken the lead and was moving faster than anyone at 40.6km per hour. Lyles, who was now just touching that same speed, had taken much longer to get there and was actually still last out of all eight runners even at 30m.\n\nLyles had made the unexpected decision earlier this year to turn up at the World Indoor Championships and take on Christian Coleman, the best 60m runner in history over the distance. He could not win, but it was a critical decision for what would follow here in Paris. Knowing that he was the fastest finisher, Lyles desperately wanted to shorten the moment between the start of the race and when he was upright in what Michael Johnson calls the 'drive phase' and ready to launch into full flight. This transition was not instantly noticeable during the race, with Lyles still trailing Thompson at 40m but making crucial inroads into the rest of the field. By halfway, he had reached 43.5kph - almost his top speed during the race - which is quicker than anyone else managed through the full 100m. It meant that had moved from eighth to third between 30m and 60m. This meant that it was now simply a question of holding his form and hoping that there would be enough track to complete his surge through the field.\n\nLyles had reached overdrive by 60m, peaking at 43.6kpm in the 10m to 70m, which is at the moment when those 100m specialists in front of him were starting to struggle to hold their form and just faltering into the final metres. What Lyles did then brilliantly here, however, was to maintain his concentration, keep relaxed and not allow the desperation that he would have felt at still not quite hitting the front to impact his running. He calls the 200m \"his wife\" and the 100m \"his mistress\" and knew that he just needed to stay faithful to his old instincts that had been honed from years of running over the longer sprint.\n\nIt was a masterful display of nerve and mind over matter just as much as pure physical speed or power. Yes, it was something that he had practised endlessly with his coach but to actually deliver it in front of 70,000 people was extraordinary.\n\nFew people are more sure of themselves than Lyles, but even he did not know who had won following a blanket finish. Incredibly, the scoreboard said that seven of the finalists were in the photo-finish and there was an agonising 30 seconds while they all just stopped and looked up at the big screen. The only finishing time that had been recorded was that of Seville, who was eighth, despite looking so dominant in beating Lyles in their semi-final.\n\nAnd then the result flashed up, Lyles' eyes almost popped out of his head to confirm, by an almost unimaginably fine margin, that he was the Olympic champion.\n\nThe difference between Lyles (9.79784) and Thompson (9.79789 was a ludicrously microscopic five thousandths of a second. The subsequent overhead photo showed that Thompson's foot had actually crossed the line first but Lyles superior lean into the finish line had sealed it for him.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Indoor_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Indoor Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3m6hUlQuJK_KVnThAsnBmA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/45acd488d1fe60eb21c151f18b3e0777", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

They wrote: \"8 frames, 1 iconic 100m final.\"\n\nSomeone else referenced Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63 seconds set in 2012, saying: \"The more you watch the 100m, the more you'll realise how fast Usain Bolt was running.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Noah Lyles making half the NBA hate him with the 'world champion of what?' speech, telling every 100m sprinter he'd beat them, underperforming in his heat and semi-final and then actually winning the gold medal is a level of elite trolling we've not seen in some time. What a guy.\"\n\nPiers Morgan congratulated the 27-year-old on his win, writing: \"Congrats @LylesNoah - you talked the talked and just walked the walk.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was as happy to see Lyles take the gold.\n\n\"Noah Lyles you survived the 100M hate watch. We will reconvene in the 200M,\" one person said.\n\nSomeone else wrote: \"Lyles is an essential villain. This may be the biggest failed hate watch ever.\"\n\nIn the build-up to the event, Lyles has not been shy about what he wants to achieve, facing accusations of being \"cocky\" in the process. But, Lyles argues, \"people assume my confidence is cockiness\".\n\nFollowing his historic win, Lyles took to X/Twitter, writing: \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression.\n\n\"But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become.

which Great Britain's Zharnel Hughes and Louie Hinchliffe failed to reach - Italy's reigning champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs was run out of the medals and another Jamaican rising star, Oblique Seville, finished last in 9.91.\n\nIn the end it was Lyles, an athlete who thrives on the sport's grandest stages and who won three golds at last year's World Championships, who sprinted away in celebration once the official result appeared on the big screen.\n\nThe 27-year-old repeatedly rang the victory bell by the side of the track after establishing himself at the pinnacle of the sport, before he targets further success in the 200m and relay events.\n\n\"You couldn't have asked for a bigger moment,\" Lyles told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I had to take every round as it was and I was a little upset after the first round so I came with the aggression, and after I ran 9.83.\n\n\"I hope you guys like Noah because I got a lot more coming!\"\n\nLyles has remained outspoken and unflinching in his belief that he has the on-track ability and off-track aura to replace Usain Bolt as the new superstar of men's athletics.\n\nThe American has talked the talk but he continues to back it up when it matters most.\n\nLyles last year became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to win a 100m and 200m world double, before completing a golden treble in the 4x100m relay.\n\nLyles claimed in the build-up to the Paris Games that he would look to add the 4x400m to that haul in the French capital, and he hinted at his form when running a 100m personal best at the London Diamond League last month.\n\nBut repeating such success on these stages, under intense pressure - much of it self-imposed - is another thing entirely.\n\nHe has now become the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, and asserted himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.\n\nA three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will look to maintain his grip on the sport's major titles in that event, which starts on Monday.\n\nShould he do so, he will move a step closer to sporting immortality in his pursuit of a historic four golds at these Games.", "source": {"uri": "nationnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nation Newspaper, The"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashminnie_moonsammy@nationnews.com", "name": "Ashminnie Moonsammy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zharnel_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zharnel Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anniversary Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Noah-Lyles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

What is a photo finish?", "body": "Noah Lyles won the men's 100m race at the Paris Olympics by the slimmest of margins. Reuters/USA Today Sports\n\nNoah Lyles put on the performance of a lifetime to win the men's 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second in 9.79 seconds, in a blistering final where a 9.91 from Jamaican Oblique Seville was only good enough to finish last.\n\nParis Olympics: News, schedule, medals tally and more\n\nSeville had crossed the line ahead of Lyles in their semi-final, and the American sprinter said he needed to get into the right mindset for his medal race.\n\nHe called his therapist in order to rebuilding his mental health, something that has propelled him to the pinnacle of his sport.\n\n\"I wouldn't say nervous \u00e2\u20ac\" I'd say I was extremely curious as to what was going to happen. That's how me and my therapist phrase it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m curious as to what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to do, how am I going to pull this off,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"I came in third-fastest from the semis. I'm like 'This is going to be serious, this is not going to be easy'. And I had said OK, my therapist said 'You need to let go, you need to relax and you need to be yourself'.\"\n\nLyles is already familiar with all the highs and lows of his sport long before he arrived in Paris, and has publicly discussed the work he put into his mental health to rebound from the pit of depression he found himself in three years ago.\n\nThe three-times 200m world champion failed to qualify for the shorter sprint at the US Olympic trials in 2021, and rebuilt himself - body and mind - with the singular goal of becoming the fastest man on earth.\n\n\"I did this against the best of the best, on the biggest stage, with the biggest pressure,\" Lyles said. \"And I wasn't even entered in the 100 in 2021. You know, here I am, first Olympics in the 100, going around now the Olympic champion.\"\n\nHe posted on X, earlier called Twitter, after the race: \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\"\n\nHow Lyles edged Kishane Thompson and the rest?\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson let out a scream after crossing the finish line. For a brief moment, he thought maybe he was the Olympic champion.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from Lyles. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner \u00e2\u20ac\" with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\nHow it panned out:\n\nLyles was slowest out of the blocks among the competitors. He took 0.178 seconds to get up and going.\n\nThompson, who made a slow start as well, surged ahead in the race but by the slimmest of margins.\n\nAt the 40m mark, Lyles trailed the eight athlete pack but no one was really pulling away to lead.\n\nAt about three seconds into the race, Lyles starts to pick up pace and get closer to the quickest runners.\n\nAt the 50m mark, Lyles wasn't at the back of the pile but not in command of the race either as Thompson maintained his lead.\n\nAt the 60m mark, the entire group seemed to be in sync with runners averaging 40.23kmph (25mph).\n\nFred Kerley, who would win bronze, appeared to be stride to stride with Thompson after the 75m mark.\n\nWith 90m gone, Lyles was still not the leading runner. If the race was 99m and not 100m, he would have finished second.\n\nAt the 100m mark, both Lyles and Thompson were clocked at 9.78 seconds. Further inspection put their difference at five-thousandths of a second.\n\nThe top-ranked runner needed to produce his fastest time ever to win an Olympic gold and even then the gap was just 0.005 seconds!\n\nWhat is a photo finish?\n\nThe race was so close that when it was over, seven of the eight runners had \"Photo\" written next to their names, needing closer inspection.\n\nAt the final moment in the race, it appeared that Thompson's leg was ahead of Lyles. Then how did the American win? The reason lies in the specifics of the photo finish rule.\n\nWorld Athletics' rulebook says, \"As the runners approach the finish line, a \"slit-video\" system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line - scans it 2,000 times per second, providing an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line - and coordinates it with the athlete's time. In a few seconds, the scoreboard will show the order of finish and each runner's time to 1/100th of a second.\n\n\"If two athletes finish in a virtual dead heat, the finish image can be greatly enlarged and the finishing time read to 1/1000th of a second so the judges can separate them.\"\n\n\"In case an athlete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image is masked or obscured for any reason, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a back-up camera on the infield so the athlete can be seen from the other side if necessary.\"\n\nAt the finish line, Thompson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foot appears to cross the line first. But the rules stipulate that the body part that has to cross the finish line for an official registration of timing is the torso. \"The torso or the trunk of a person includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and the back,\" explain the rules.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(draw)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tie (draw)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Noah-Lyles-Reuters-1200-2024-08-72b8c4a23e9377f5d3975eebddc89748.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

In one of the closest finals in Olympic history, the leader of the pack -- Noah Lyles -- pulled out a victory with nothing left to spare.\n\nIt took a near-perfect race and a dip at the end, but the 27-year-old Lyles edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson with a personal best time of 9.784 seconds. Thompson also ran a 9.79, but Lyles finished 0.005 of a second faster. Lyles's teammate, Fred Kerley, won the bronze.\n\nThe race was so close that Lyles, in real time, said he thought Thompson had won. \"We were waiting for the names to pop up, and I'll be honest, I came over and I was like, 'I think you got the Olympics, dog,' \" Lyles said.\n\nThompson, running in his first Olympics, remembered Lyles coming over after the race but had no idea of what had just happened.\n\n\"When we both crossed the line, as he said, he came to me and said, 'Hey man, I think you got it,' \" Thompson recalled. \"I was like, 'Wow, I'm not even sure,' because it was that close.\"\n\nLyles was flying blind in the race. Thompson was in Lane 4 and Lyles, who was in Lane 7, couldn't see how strong a race Thompson was running. Fortunately for Lyles, he listened to an inner voice that spoke just as he approached the tape. \"Something said I need to lean, and I was like, 'I'm going to lean,' because it was that kind of race,\" he said.\n\nThat turned out to be a gold-medal lean.\n\nOf course, this is what the Olympics are about. An athlete trains for years to be able to compete at the moment of truth. We saw Simone Biles do it in gymnastics and Katie Ledecky do it in swimming. On Sunday, the world saw Lyles do it on the track.\n\nThe great thing about Sunday's race is that Lyles was the loudest voice in the room -- boisterous, talking trash and taking names. And at his moment of truth, he delivered.\n\n\"I mean, it feels good to back it up,\" he said. \"I've seen tons of scenarios where athletes come in as a favorite and it doesn't work out for them. Knowing that that could happen continues to fuel me, and that's just constantly going that extra step, knowing that at any time, somebody could pop up.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the season, many track experts said 2024 would be a slow year for sprinting.\n\n\"Well, it wasn't no slow year in the hundred,\" Lyles said.\n\nThis was a great race, a dramatic victory and an invigorating moment for U.S. track and field. Ever since the 100 meters became the cornerstone of the Olympic competition, the United States has been a dominant force. Not including Sunday's result, the United States has won 16 of the 29 men's gold medals and nine of the 22 women's gold medals in Olympic history. But there has been a significant drought.\n\nWhat has hung over the heads of not just Lyles but the entire U.S. sprinting community is the idea that American sprinters, once a feared commodity on the international stage, had lost their swagger. No one feared U.S. sprinters as they had, even going back to yesteryear names like Charley Paddock, Eddie Tolan, Jesse Owens and Wilma Rudolph.\n\nBecause of \"Bullet\" Bob Hayes at the 1964 Tokyo Games, critics coined the phrase \"World's Fastest Human\" and conferred the title on the winner of the 100 meters. Carl Lewis won back-to-back Olympic 100-meter titles in 1984 and 1988, and then Maurice Green -- a relative unknown -- showed what a deep bench of sprinters the United States had when he won the gold at the Sydney Games in 2000.\n\nWho would have guessed that when Justin Gatlin won the 100 meters in 2004, his victory would be the United States' last Olympic gold medal in the event until Sunday night when Lyles was pushed to run the race of a lifetime.\n\nCritics mistakenly conflate the United States' Olympic gold-medal drought with poor training. The reality is that sprinting continues to be vibrant in the United States. It's just that many of the sprinters are coming from out of the country.\n\nThe United States' coaching system continues to attract and train many of the world's greatest sprinters. The fact that athletes can earn a college scholarship makes the system attractive to international athletes.\n\nJulien Alfred, who became Saint Lucia's first-ever Olympic champion on Saturday when she upset Sha'Carri Richardson to win the women's 100 meters, ran collegiately for the University of Texas. While Lyles opted to turn professional out of high school, Kerley attended a community college. They are part of the resurgence.\n\nOn Sunday, Lyles said he wanted his gold-medal performance to keep the attention on U.S. sprinters. He pointed to the enthusiastically received Netflix series Sprint as an example.\n\n\"I want to see a continuation of the ability to take advantage of moments for our sport,\" he said. \"What we need to do as a sport is take advantage and say 'Hey, we need to make this as available as possible for people to come and watch. This needs to be accessible because this is a world sport, and we need to be able to show it to the world.' \"\n\nBefore the media session ended, a reporter asked Lyles what he hoped to get out of his Olympic performances individually, which could yield at least two more gold medals. He will run in the 200 meters and the 4\u00d7100 relay this week.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" he said without hesitation. Lyles pointed out that the great Michael Johnson never had his own shoe. \"I want my own trainer. I want a sneaker; there ain't no money in spikes.\n\n\"I feel like for how many medals we bring back, the notoriety we get, the fact that that hasn't happened is crazy to me.''\n\nLyles won a dramatic race on Sunday and bestowed the U.S. sprinting community with a great gift: he gave it back its swag.", "source": {"uri": "andscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andscape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_c_rhoden@andscape.com", "name": "William C.

He brought it with him to the Stade de France the past few days because the sight of it instantly motivates him.\n\nLyles won his first career Olympic gold medal in a photo finish on Sunday night, coming from behind to overtake Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and edge him by five-thousandths of a second. He is the first American to capture first place in the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin did it 20 years ago.\n\nThat could be the beginning of a transformative week for Lyles in Paris if all goes according to plan. He is a heavy favorite to win gold in the 200 this week and he is the most obvious choice to run the anchor leg in the men's 4x100-meter relay. The way Lyles sees it, he might even talk his way into running a leg of the 4x400-meter relay and giving himself a chance at a rare fourth gold medal in the same Olympics.\n\nThe starting point for all that success came three years ago. Lyles doesn't achieve gold in Paris if he didn't settle for bronze in Tokyo.\n\nDuring the buildup to the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles was not in a good head space. The depression that he had dealt with when bullied as a kid had returned, fueled by the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and uncertainty surrounding when or if the postponed Tokyo Olympics would ever happen.\n\nLyles only qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in the 200, not the 100. When he arrived to empty stadiums, strict COVID protocols and minimal support from family or friends, his mental health further deteriorated.\n\nStanding on the starting line before the men's 200 final, he remembers thinking, \"This is not fun. This is not it.\"\n\nLyles, then 24 and already the best 200-meter runner in the world, finished third in the 200 that day, just his second career loss at that distance as a professional. He uncharacteristically couldn't hold a slim lead as he rounded the curve and let Canada's Andre De Grasse and fellow American Kenny Bednarek overtake him.\n\nWhen Lyles spoke to reporters that night, he called his bronze medal \"boring.\" He sobbed as he talked about his own mental health struggles, about antidepressants causing him to gain weight, about having to cycle off that medication to prepare for Olympic Trials.\n\nLyles returned home saying to himself, \"I've got to change. I've got to evolve.\" Recommitting to therapy, he says, is what made the biggest difference for him. Therapy helped him overcome his crippling fears of returning to the track and to convert the disappointment of Tokyo into fuel for future success.\n\nWhereas before he felt pressure to live up to other people's expectations for him or anxious before a big race, now he says he tries to frame it as though he is \"extremely curious as to what is going to happen.\"\n\n\"That's how me and my therapist phrase it,\" he said, smiling. \"I'm curious what I'm going to do. How am I going to pull this off?\"\n\nThe chance that Lyles wanted to see didn't take years or even months. It took weeks. Only a month after the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles ran a world-leading time in the 200 at the Prefontaine Classic. He followed that up in 2022 by eclipsing Michael Johnson's American record in the 200 and last year by pulling off the rare sprint treble at World Championships last year.\n\nEverything that Lyles achieved can be traced back to three years ago.\n\n\"I'll be like, 'Yeah, I think I'm doing enough,\" Lyles said earlier this summer. \"Then I turn around and look at the medal -- 'All right, back to work.'\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefontaine_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prefontaine Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EfLm8PXuEB.ozd7i6JIR.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/ce130320-52b7-11ef-bc7f-15ebdfb0c2c9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Sunday night. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner - with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"I\u00b4m a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said. \"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn\u00b4t think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said. \"It\u00b4s too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nKishane Thompson, of Jamaica, reacts after crossing the finish line in the men's 100 meters final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,\" he said. \"Everybody loves winners.\"\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish. Thompson knew it was close and immediately glanced at the scoreboard for an answer.\n\nHe waited. They all waited.\n\nLyles gave him a glimmer of hope, though.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I even said, 'Bro, I think you got that one big dog. And then my name popped up, and I\u00b4m like, \u00b4Oh my gosh, I\u00b4m amazing.\u00b4\"\n\nThompson became the first Jamaican to be on the podium in the men's Olympic 100 since Bolt's run of three straight titles in 2008, \u00b412 and \u00b416.\n\n\"My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad,\" Thompson said. \"I\u00b4m super grateful.\"\n\nThompson entered the race with the fastest time of the season and was viewed as the biggest threat to Lyles. It came down to the wire with all eight sprinters separated by a margin of .12 seconds - and even closer for gold and silver.\n\n\"That close,\" Thompson said. \"It was that close.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nKishane Thompson, of Jamaica, and Noah Lyles, of the United States, in the background, wait for the official results after finishing the men's 100 meters final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

(Photo by JUNG Yeon-je / AFP)\n\nAs Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters made the final adjustments to their starting blocks.\n\n- Tense buildup -The lights were then shut off, the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum.\n\nEach sprinter was individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.\n\nAsked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt.\n\n\"100 percent,\" he said. \"That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to

According to BBC Sport (per Reel Analytics), Lyles, who won the gold medal for the event, reached a speed of 27.1 miles per hour. Akani Simbine, who came in fourth place, had the second-best speed at 26.9 mph. Silver medal winner Kishane Thompson and bronze medal winner Fred Kerley tied for the third-best speed at 26.8 mph.\n\nThe race was memorable as Lyles was named the winner via a photo finish. It was determined that the American sprinter became the \"world's fastest man\" by 0.005 of a second.\n\n\"We were waiting for the names to pop up, and I'm going to be honest, I came over [to Thompson] and I was like: 'I think you got that one, big dawg!'\" Lyles said in his postrace news conference, per ESPN. \"Something said I need to lean, and I was like, 'I'm going to lean,' because it's that type of race.\"\n\nOriginally, Lyles didn't think he won the race. \"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm gonna be honest, I think you had that one',\" Lyles told Eurosport after the race, per Olympics.com. \"I was fully prepared to see his name pop up. and to see my name pop, I'm like, 'goodness gracious, I'm incredible'.\"\n\nLyles had to make up ground after a slow start. And while he loves rising to the occasion, Sunday's race proved that he can do it on the biggest stage. \"I wouldn't say I'm nervous,\" Lyles explained. \"I'd say I was extremely curious as to what was going to happen...\n\n\"I'm curious as to what I'm going to do, how I'm going to pull this off. Because I came in third-fastest from the semis and I'm like, 'This is going to be serious, this is not going to be easy.\"\n\nLyles now has two Olympic medals as he earned a bronze for the 200-meter dash at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which took place in 2021).

But Lyles, who claimed the world title in Budapest last year, saved his best performance for when it truly mattered.\n\nHe has written his name among the great American sprinters of the past, won the fastest 100m final in history and claimed the first gold in his bid for a Paris hattrick.\n\nThe new Olympic champion spoke exclusively with Mail Sport's DAVID COVERDALE last month about how he battled depression and regained his confidence ahead of the Games.\n\nNoah Lyles was crowned as the new men's 100m Olympic champion after an epic race on Sunday night\n\nThe 27-year-old finished just 0.005 seconds ahead of Jamaican youngster Kishane Thompson (yellow jersey)\n\nYou will most likely know him as the trash-talking, vest-ripping, gold medal-winning sprinter-showman. The American who boasts of having 'main character energy', plays the starring role in a new Netflix series and is now set to be the headline act at the Olympics .\n\nThere is, though, another side to Noah Lyles , a vulnerability beneath the bravado. Indeed, on his last appearance at the Games, the athlete who usually lights up the track was trapped in darkness.\n\n'I was depressed,' admits Lyles about his time at Tokyo 2020. 'I was coming off my antidepressant medication at the time because I was gaining weight in an unnatural way. There was a lot going on.\n\n'It was a real fake-it-to-make-it year for me. I watched back my race in Tokyo and I was like, \"I really don't know that guy. I don't know who that is but it's not Noah\".\n\n'It is kind of scary at times. Just even seeing my mannerisms. I am like, \"Why did I do that? What was I thinking at that time?\". Every day I wake up now and thank God that I am not in that scenario.'\n\nAmerican sprint sensation Noah Lyles has admitted he suffered from depression\n\nThere is another side to Lyles, a vulnerability hidden beneath the showman's bravado\n\nTokyo was not the first time Lyles has struggled. In fact, he has been in and out of therapy since the age of 10, having been bullied at school for having yellow teeth, caused by medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as suffering from asthma and dyslexia.\n\nLyles's mental health really nosedived, though, in 2020, caused by the combination of the Covid pandemic, the uncertainty and then postponement of the Olympics, and the reaction to the killing of George Floyd. When the Tokyo Games eventually took place behind closed doors in 2021, he could only claim a bronze medal in the 200m despite winning the world title in 2019.\n\nIn the 100m, he did not even make the US team.\n\nFast-forward three years, and Lyles is the 100m and 200m world champion and loving life, on and off the track. The secret to his new-found happiness? 'A lot of therapy,' the 26-year-old tells Mail Sport. 'I have two therapists. One is my sports therapist, the other is my personal therapist for life beyond the track.\n\n'There is a fear in the back of my mind that it (depression) will come back. But every time I think that, I am like, \"I am so much better, I am in such a great place\". I just chalk that up as the devil trying to whisper sweet nothings in my ear.'\n\nWhile that devil had a hold of Lyles three years ago, he believes that pain of Tokyo is the driving force for what has happened since. In 2022, he defended his 200m world title in Eugene, where he celebrated Incredible Hulk-style by ripping open his US vest.\n\nIn 2022, he defended his 200m world title in Oregon and celebrated by ripping his US vest\n\nThen, 12 months later in Budapest, he became the first man since Usain Bolt to complete the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay sprint treble at a World Championships.\n\n'That bronze still burns a hole in my chest,' admits Lyles, who set a new personal best of 9.81sec to win the 100m at the London Diamond League. 'I will be carrying it around during Paris just to remind me this is not the colour we are coming back with.\n\n'It has never been a secret that I was disappointed with how 2021 went and how much of a fire it lit in my belly. It was the catalyst for everything that has happened after.\n\n'I truly believe that at some point in another alternative universe if I had won that gold medal, I would have become complacent in my ability, and I wouldn't have seen as much growth as I have in the last two years.'\n\nGrowth as a sprinter but also as a celebrity. As well as his lead role in the new Netflix documentary Sprint, which follows the world's fastest men and women, Lyles has appeared on The Tonight Show and is on the cover of this month's Time magazine.\n\nLyles does not like being compared to Bolt, but he is undoubtedly the first athlete since the Jamaican retired in 2017 who has the stardust required to transcend the sport. He now just needs an Olympic gold medal to elevate his fame to the next level and make him an icon - the word he has tattooed on his torso.\n\nLyles revealed the bronze medal he won in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics still pains him\n\nHe has grown both as a sprinter and as a celebrity and now just needs to win Olympic gold\n\n'I have been shocked with the attention the Netflix show has got,' says Lyles. 'I am running past high schoolers and they are like, \"Yo, that's Noah Lyles, let me get a picture\". Droves of high-school kids. I don't know if I can go out by myself any more!\n\n'But getting it done at the Olympics would up the ante and put me in a position where I can demand a few more things.'\n\nSuch is Lyles's pivotal part in Sprint, he has worked closely with producers Box to Box, who made Formula 1: Drive to Survive, on his storylines for the second series, which is currently being filmed. Lyles, though, is not only interested in boosting his own popularity, but athletics as a whole.\n\n'We have been working a lot closer into trying to truly make it an interesting story, so that when people watch the show, they are going to say, \"Oh my gosh, I have to watch the next track meet\",' reveals Lyles. 'We want people to be entertained and not only me becoming more popular, but also having the chance for more athletes to become just as popular.\n\n'My ambition is my ambition, my joy is my joy and my goals are my goals, but it just so happens that one of my goals is to see track and field succeed and be better than when I joined it.'\n\nWhen Mail Sport first met Lyles last December, he set out his blueprint to boost the profile of the sport, which included hosting four major annual events around the world, like in tennis. That vision has now become a reality after American legend Michael Johnson recently launched Grand Slam Track, which will see four meets hosted each year, where athletes can each win $100,000 (\u00a377,000).\n\nLyles is not only interested in boosting his own popularity but athletics as a whole\n\nAmerican hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and British middle-distance star Josh Kerr have become the first athletes to sign up for the big-money series. Will Lyles be the next to join?\n\n'I can't say if I will or will not be a part of it yet,' he replies. 'I am still in negotiations with them but there is a lot of good that is being created by it. I am very happy to see it because the last thing that I want is that nothing gets done.\n\n'There is a general want for change and an excitement for a new venture in the track space. I hope that it's going to breed great fortune for everybody.'\n\nLyles has long championed the need for athletes to be better rewarded, so he backs World Athletics' controversial decision to offer prize-money of $50,000 (\u00a338,600) for Olympic gold medallists.\n\n'I am very proud to see World Athletics step up because it's not their job to do that, it's the job of the IOC (International Olympic Committee),' he says. 'I got so many messages after it came out saying, \"Y'all don't get paid already?\". The other one was, \"I would think a gold medal would be worth more than that\". That's a conversation we need to have.'\n\nAnother conversation is around athletics' problem with doping, something that has dogged the sport for decades. At the last Olympics, Great Britain were stripped of their 4x100m relay silver medal after CJ Ujah tested positive for two banned substances and was subsequently banned for 22 months.\n\nHe is eyeing up shattering records in Paris and believes he is in the best shape of his life\n\nThe shock 100m winner in Tokyo, Marcell Jacobs, also faced awkward questions after it emerged his former nutritionist Giacomo Spazzini was implicated in a police investigation into the distribution of steroids. He was later cleared in a criminal court and Jacobs has never been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nDoes Lyles believe all his opponents are clean? 'I can't prove it and it's not my job to prove it,' he says. 'Of course I am going to have some suspicions, but if you are on the line, I am going to assume you are clean and it's my job to beat you. Even if you are not clean, I believe I am such a good athlete that I should be able to beat you.'\n\nLyles' time at the London Stadium yesterday was only the third fastest in the world this year. Kishane Thompson is the quickest man on the planet in 2024, registering 9.77sec to win the Jamaican trials, while Kenya's Ferdinand Omanyala has clocked 9.79sec.\n\nLyles, though, is confident he will be fastest at the Stade de France. He is eyeing up Tyson Gay's American record of 9.69sec in the 100m, the event he calls his 'mistress', as well as Bolt's world record of 19.19sec in the 200m, the race he refers to as his 'wife'.\n\n'I am in the best shape of my life,' he insists. 'I am seeing times in training I don't usually see. In the 100m, the American record is constantly on my mind. In the 200m, 19.10 is definitely the goal.\n\n'In the indoor season, I improved my 60m time by 1.02 per cent. If I add that on to the 100m, I should break the record. And if I add that to the 200m, I should run 19.10.'\n\nAfter Japan's empty stadiums, Lyles is relishing the prospect of performing in front of a crowd\n\nFor Lyles, though, it is medals not records that count. As long ago as December, he revealed he wanted to add the 4x400m relay to his programme in a bid to win four golds in Paris - something even Bolt did not achieve. However, when he then ran a 4x400m leg at the World Indoors in Glasgow in March, it caused a storm in the US, with other athletes and coaches complaining of 'favouritism'.\n\nThat appears to have put his dream in doubt, but Lyles insists: 'Anyone who is on the US team can be in the relay pool. It's the relay coaches' decision. If they want to use me, I am here. I am not going to have hurt feelings about it.'\n\nWhether or not the quadruple remains possible, the treble is certainly on. And after the empty stadiums of Japan, Lyles is relishing the prospect of performing in front of a full house in France.\n\n'I am a showman, so I need an audience, intensity, pressure,' he adds. 'The more eyes on me, the better I perform. As soon as I get on the stage when the TV is on and people are watching, I ain't losing. The big moments are what I live for.\n\n'Showing up to Tokyo and just hearing an empty stadium, an echo, it was surreal. But Paris is going to feel the complete opposite. Everything is going to be heightened up to a new level.\n\n'The Olympics is the pinnacle, and I don't have an Olympic gold medal right now. But after Budapest, it's like, \"We have done this before, now we are going to do it again\".'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

Lyles had his first shot at Olympic immortality today with the 100-meter.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS: Follow USA TODAY's full coverage here\n\nThe finals were not Lyles' first race of the day, though. The 100-meter semifinals took place earlier today as well, with Lyles finishing second in his heat, two-hundredths of a second off the winner, Jamaica's Oblique Seville (9.81). That result spawned this viral picture of Lyles eyeing down the man who beat him.\n\nAnother Jamaican, Kishane Thompson, also ran a 9.8 in the semifinals to seed himself above Lyles. Still, despite having not won either of the two qualifying races leading up to the finals, Lyles was still a popular pick to win gold.\n\nHere's how the race played out.\n\nOlympics News: Stephen Nedoroscik won bronze for pommel horse, and then went viral\n\nFull 100-meter dash race\n\nThe race was tremendously close. Not even the announcers knew who won, thinking that Thompson earned the win on initial viewing. But it was Lyles who barely edged out every other racer. Even on repeat views in slow motion, it was hard to determine just when Lyles finished compared to the other athletes.\n\nFull 100-meter dash results\n\nFirst-, second- and third-place finishers win gold, silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nWhat does this mean for Lyles?\n\nLyles' win gave America its first gold in the 100-meter since Justin Gatlin at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Lyles' dream of winning four golds at these games is still alive and well.\n\nWhen does Lyles race next?\n\nHeats for the 200-meter will happen on Monday. Lyles' first race will happen at 8:30 a.m. ET. The finals for the 200-meter are set for Thursday, Aug. 8 at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nCarl Lewis is the last American to win both the 100- and 200-meter dashes in the same Olympics (1984).", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2004_Summer_Paralympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/04/USAT/74666535007-usatsi-23909536.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6977,3924,x8,y196&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1833, "textEnd": 1839}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This marks the first time since 2004 that two Americans have stood on the podium for the 100 meters, breaking the long-standing Jamaican dominance led by Usain Bolt.\n\nLyles had an impressive journey to the final. Although he faced some challenges in the heats and semifinals, where he struggled with a slow start, he ultimately pulled through with a strong finish. His victory in Paris not only set a personal best but also solidified his reputation after winning the 100 meters at the World Championships the previous year.\n\nLyles' win in the 100 meters is just the beginning of his Olympic campaign, as he aims for a double gold with the 200 meters and possibly a third gold in the 4\u00d7100 meter relay. The 200-meter heats begin on Monday, with the final set for August 8th. Lyles is also a strong contender for the relay, scheduled for August 9th.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baller Alert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://balleralert.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1642258963-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1267, "textEnd": 1277}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1341, "textEnd": 1351}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Both athletes were officially given a time of 9.79, with Lyles' late surge and critical dip at the line proving to be the difference between the two sprinters in a tense photo-finish.\n\nRunning out of lane seven, Lyles, who was beaten earlier in the day in the first semifinal by Jamaica's Oblique Seville, looked to be out of contention midway through the final as both Thompson and USA's Fred Kerley led the pack. Using his lethal top-end speed, Lyles gained ground on the leaders in the final 40 metres and just managed to pip Thompson on the line - achieving a new personal best in the process.\n\nAfter the race, both men waited anxiously to see the final result, and it was Lyles who was filled with elation as his first-place finish was confirmed.\n\nKerley ensured the US copped two medals in the final, as he grabbed third in 9.81. South Africa's Akani Simbine ran a national record and placed fourth in 9.82.\n\nTokyo 2021 Olympic champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs ran a season's best for fifth spot in 9.85, with Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (9.86) also breaking a national record with his sixth-placed finish.\n\nUSA's Kenny Bednarek (9.88) and Seville (9.91) finished seventh and eighth respectively. The latter athlete cut a disappointing figure after the race as he told SportsMax he had felt discomfort in his groin during the race.\n\nThe men's 100m final was a far cry from the women's 100m final on August 3, as the winner, Lyles, and the eighth-placed Seville were separated by just 0.12 seconds. The gap was closer than the distance between women's 100m champion Julien Alfred and silver medallist Sha'Carri Richardson, who clocked 10.72 and 10.87 seconds respectively.\n\nLyles will try to further enhance his case in the \"fastest man\" argument when he faces the starter in heat six of the men's 200m from 2.30 pm (TT time) on August 5.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.co.tt", "dataType": "news", "title": "Trinidad and Tobago Newsday"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roneil_walcott@newsday.co.tt", "name": "Roneil Walcott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Masters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Masters", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/23279151-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 224}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1963, "textEnd": 1971}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2392, "textEnd": 2400}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Lyles took 0.0178 sec to react to the gun and begin his race. That might sound quick but in a sport measured in thousandths of a second, he had just given up 0.07 to one his biggest rivals, fellow American Fred Kerley.\n\nThe man Lyles most feared, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, was just as sluggish, reacting in 0.0176. Yet Thompson is the fastest man this year for a reason. He is a 100m specialist with power and a long stride, and he emerged from his drive phase at 30m with the lead.\n\nBy contrast, and despite being the 100m world champion, Lyles is a 200m runner by trade. His strength is in his top speed but he takes a little while to get there, and his slow start has sometimes been an Achilles heel. At 30m he was dead last, eighth out of eight.\n\nCrucially, though, Lyles was now travelling towards the finish line quicker than anyone else. Between 50m and 60m he made a rapid, stunning climb from eighth to third as he reached his peak speed of the race, 43.6km/hr (27.1mph).\n\nAt this point, the leader Thompson (43.2km/hr) and second-place Kerley (43.1km/hr) had already hit their top speed and they were fighting to maintain it. Thompson, running in his first Olympic final, was clearly tensing up, grimacing and straining for the line.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me to the line in the position that I know I could have gone to,\" Thompson later admitted. \"But I have learned from it.\"\n\nThis is where Lyles came into his element. His speed endurance is his strength, which is why he is such a successful 200m sprinter. He is also an experienced campaigner, having run in Olympic and world finals with memories of both success and failure to call upon. Lyles stayed calm and composed, holding his smooth running style all the way to the line.\n\n\"To be honest, I was like, if I'm running 9.83 in the semi-finals I'm going to be hard to beat,\" he said. \"I called my therapist and she was like, 'you need to let go, you need to let it flow', I was like, 'alright, I'm going to trust you'.\"\n\nHe still had one last job to do. The photo finish shows how Lyles body is leaning forwards, head dragging the torso through the line with the legs trailing behind. If Lyles' lean is around 60 degrees from the track, Thompson's is more like 75.\n\nTechnically, Thompson's right hallux was the first body part to complete this Olympic final. But finish lines only recognise the chest. Lyles won gold by five thousandths of a second, quicker than the time it takes to blink.\n\n\"I did think [Thompson] had it at the end,\" Lyles admitted. \"I went up to him while we were waiting, and said \"I think you've got that, good going', and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\"\n\nHe had overcome not only seven rival finalists but the weight of American expectation, delivering Olympic men's 100m gold for the first time in 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in Athens.\n\n\"I had so many commercials going around and so many people, like Snoop Dog is out here, saying that I'm going to be the one.

It had been highly anticipated as Lyles talked his game, which included taking a shot at the NBA.\n\nHe backed up his claims, winning gold in a photo finish on Sunday, Aug. 4. He became the first male USA runner to win gold in the 100-meter dash since 2004.\n\nJust about every moment of the race was tense and exciting, from the longer-than-usual wait to Lyles' celebration with his mother. As hours have passed since the race, photos are still flooding the internet.\n\nHere are some of the best photos and videos from the 100-meter dash at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nMORE: Full results, highlights from Day 3 of track and field at 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nCameras caught just about every angle of this year's 100-meter final. Overhead shots, side-by-side views, and even graphics that show the runners at each frame of the race.\n\nThis overhead shot, taken right at the finish line, provides a different angle of just how close the race really was. You might still think that Kishane Thompson in lane 4 edged out Lyles in lane 7 even after looking at this picture.\n\nHere's a slightly different angle at the finish line, where it's a little clearer that Lyles won...right?\n\nThis overhead view, taken roughly midway through the race, gives an idea of how much ground Lyles, third from the bottom, had to make up on Thompson, third from the top -- and practically every other runner in the field.\n\nStill not convinced? Check out the overlay of the race roughly every 10 meters. Lyles was actually in last place at the 40m mark.\n\nThe view from behind provides a similar perspective of how far ahead Thompson appeared to be with just 50 meters remaining.\n\nEven among the blur caused by their blazing speeds, you can see the determination on both Thompson's and Lyles' faces as they lunge for the finish line.\n\nNothing was final until the official photo-finish photo below was inspected by the race officials.\n\nAfter sprinting at max speeds of over 20 mph for just under 10 seconds, Thompson and Lyles stand still, waiting to find out who will be wearing the gold medal -- an unusual sight for any Olympic sprinting event.\n\nAmong the thousands of photos of Lyles' celebration -- from defiantly showing off his name card to ringing the victory bell -- this triumphant picture of Lyles wearing the American flag like a superhero's cape projected near one of the most iconic structures in the world might just be the defining image of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nFinally, amid a sea of cameras and spectators from all over the world, the fastest and most famous man on the planet, if only for a moment, slows down to find his family and embrace his biggest fan -- his mother.\n\nThey say pictures are worth 1,000 words, but you really only need one to sum up the 2024 Olympic men's 100m final: Legendary.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/GettyImages-2165287169.jpg?itok=WWML3f3p", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 452, "textEnd": 458}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This year's men's final was one of the absolute best and closest in Olympic history, needing a photo finish to decide the winner.\n\nThat winner ended up being the USA's Noah Lyles, who edged Jamaican Kishane Thompson at the line by 5 thousandths of a second in a time of 9.79. But, the legendary play-by-play man Leigh Diffey never saw Lyles coming, completely screwing up the call of the race.\n\nNoah Lyles, who is trying to accomplish the prestigious 100M-200M double, got off to a slow start in the race, and looked out of gold medal contention halfway. But, an incredible second-half of the race won him the gold medal.\n\nBut, listen to the call of Leigh Diffey. He never saw Noah Lyles coming until it was too late. American Fred Kerley was stride for stride with Thompson the entire race, and that's apparently where his eyes went as the race went on.\n\nAs Thompson crossed the line, out-leaning Kerley, Diffey thought that Thompson had won, exclaiming \"Kishane Thompson is a gold medalist!\"\n\nBut, that's not what had happened. Noah Lyles had hawked Thompson down. In fact, it wasn't until Lyles went crazy upon seeing the result on the screen inside the Stade de France that Diffey realized what had just happened.\n\nThat was a really tough race to call, as the race happens fast enough to begin with, and a late comeback like that can come out of nowhere But, I'm sure that Leigh Diffey would like to have one of the biggest race calls of his life back.\n\nAs for Lyles, he is much closer now to winning that double. If he does it, he will be the first American to accomplish it since Carl Lewis in 1984.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@boston.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}],

It also cements Lyles as the premier American superstar in this sport as the charismatic 27-year-old sprinter had already been one of the top faces of track and field with his blazing speed and viral moments.\n\nThompson, who was the betting favorite in the race, took the silver medal and American Fred Kerley took home the bronze.\n\nIt was a sterling version of the signature Olympic race. Taking place on the same night as the women's high jump final and the men's hammer throw final, along with qualifying heats in multiple other races, the showpiece event didn't begin until all those other competitions were done for the day.\n\nWhen the time came, the lights went out in the Stade de France just as the sun had nearly set. And then it lit back up as wristbands on the 80,000 spectators in the stadium began to flash, creating another one of the dazzling light shows that these Paris Olympics are becoming known for.\n\nEach competitor received an introduction, but Lyles took it like no other, bounding nearly halfway down the track to hype up the crowd and let off a little emotion. Lyles has gone viral in the past for such pre-race moves like pulling out Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before key races, but this time it was only his energy on display.\n\nWhen all the competitors had entered the track, they stood waiting for what felt like an eternity as dramatic music played throughout the stadium.\n\nEventually, the music stopped and the competitors settled into the starting blocks. The stadium fell completely silent - tens of thousands and all one could hear was the wind - before the horn sounded. A mighty roar cut the tension as the sprinters hung together in a tight pack through the first 50 meters of the race.\n\nThere was some separation in the back half of the less-than-10-second contest - the first 100-meter Olympic final in which running a 10-second qualifying heat would not guarantee passage to the final race and the first where every competitor ran sub-10 seconds with a legal wind, according to World Athletics - but not nearly enough for it to be clear who won when the runners crossed the finish line.\n\nThe pack of panting sprinters gathered at the northeastern bend in the track, doubled over catching their breath while they stared up at the big screen, waiting for results. For a while, it only read \"Photo,\" indicating a photo finish.\n\nAnd then the update came through: Lyles had done it.\n\nHe took off again, bounding around the track in ecstasy.\n\nThat photo finish makes it one of the most incredible and dramatic 100-meter races in Olympic history.\n\nThe final times - Lyles finishing in 9.784 seconds, Thompson in 9.789 - tell the story neatly. But it's not the whole tale, given Lyles' qualifying rounds over the last two days.\n\nThe American finished second in both the first round and the semifinal qualifiers, seeming to do just enough to get to the final race but being underwhelming enough for fans to wonder if all of Lyles' bravado was going to be overmatched on this biggest of stages.\n\nLyles said afterward that he was convinced Thompson had beat him to the line.\n\n\"It was a crazy moment because, like I said, I did think that because Kishane had that and I was like, 'Man, I really, you know, have to swallow my pride,' which I don't have a problem doing because respect deserves respect,\" he said.\n\nBut when his name popped up on the board first, he knew he'd earned the right to celebrate a bit.\n\n\"I was like, I didn't do this against a slow field. I did this against the best of the best on the biggest stage with the biggest pressure. And seeing the names, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, there it is.'\"\n\nThompson, meanwhile, crushed the competition in each of his races, simply on cruise control until he reached the final. His nation's long history of sprinting success and his own cool demeanor appeared to be enough wind at his back to get him across the finish line first.\n\nThompson put the defeat on himself, telling reporters that he didn't trust himself enough.\n\n\"I really beat myself today in that I didn't trust myself and my speed to bring myself to the line in first place,\" he said, giving kudos to Lyles and the rest of the field for pushing him.\n\nThe American champion is hoping Sunday night's result is just the start of a historic Games - and he won't have a lot of time to rest on his laurels.\n\nLyles' signature race - this was his first time running the 100m at the Olympics - is the 200-meters and qualification for that distance begins on Monday morning.\n\nHe's also aiming to add a pair of relay medals on his neck - the men's 4\u00d7100-meter relay and possibly the 4\u00d7400-meter relay, if he's chosen for the team.\n\nLyles' confidence after the race for the rest of the Olympics is - not surprisingly - sky-high.\n\n\"I'll just leave it there, I'll be winning,\" he said.\n\n\"None of them are winning,\" he added of the 200-meter field. \"When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.\"", "source": {"uri": "theatlantavoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta Voice | Atlanta GA News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That was the margin between the American Noah Lyles and the Jamaican Kishane Thompson, who both crossed the line in 9.79sec. After a long wait, and plenty of racing hearts, Lyles was declared the winner.\n\nAnother American, Fred Kerley, took bronze in 9.81, with the South African Akani Simbine fourth.\n\nWhen Lyles won the world 200m title in 2022 he set his sights on a daring new goal: becoming a global star and influencer. It sounded like a preposterous dream. But then he won three gold medals at the 2023 world championships in Budapest. And, with the Netflix cameras and boom mics in tow, he also emerged as the co-star of the docu-series Sprint. Now, after this, everything is on the table for him.\n\nLyles had been last after 15 metres, his start less explosive than his main rivals. But over the last few metres he closed on Thompson in front of him, before getting the dip on the line.\n\nWhen Netflix made Sprint, which has brought the adrenalised thrills of the 100m to an entirely new audience, it never even bothered to speak to either Thompson or Oblique Seville. Instead, most of its focus was directed at those with a star spangled banner on their vest, including Lyles and Kerley.\n\n[ Olympics: Complete day-by-day guide to the Irish athletes in action in ParisOpens in new window ]\n\nIt meant that when the sprinters were introduced to the crowd of 75,000 at the Stade de France with a dazzling show and the soundtrack of Kavinsky, Lyles and Kerley were given the biggest cheers.\n\nAs they were introduced, Thompson roared like the king of the jungle, while Kerley put his fingers to his lips. Lyles, meanwhile, bounded halfway down the track, hollering in excitement\n\n.\n\nNormally the sprinters do not have to wait long to start after that. Instead, they were kept an age standing on the blocks, as the crowd clapped and the music played. Perhaps that explained why they all seemed to run tight, and the times were less quick than had been expected.\n\nIf the race had been 99 metres, Thompson would have been celebrating, but fast-finishing Lyles kept his form superbly and timed his dip expertly to add Olympic gold to his world title.\n\nHe ripped his bib name from his shirt and held it aloft, announcing himself, as he had always promised, as the fastest man in the world.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" said Lyles, the first American Olympic 100m champion since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\n\"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nAkani Simbini of South Africa was fourth, making it a remarkable six fourth or fifth finishes in global championships, albeit with the consolation of a national record of 9.83.\n\nDefending champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, heavily strapped, finished fifth in 9.85, and such was the quality of the race that even eighth-placed Oblique Seville of Jamaica still clocked 9.91 seconds.\n\nIt was the first time that eight men have broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal 100 metres race.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/GMKAD67RFXPJQFTP6YHMX2OG5E.jpg?smart=true&auth=b71d1b65ad7288c6f1bd32d189ffad438b94ee27ba36d80e9fcab61537ee39f4&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

He was wrong; Lyles had taken gold by just five thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles is known for his relatively weak starts, and his gold-winning race was no exception. In fact, the American's start was the joint slowest; he shared a 0.178 reaction time with Botswana's Letsile Tebogo. When told that statistic after the race by a journalist, Lyles said: \"Slowest reaction time -- that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nThe slow start looked as if it had destroyed his chances, and he was still trailing in last place some 40 meters in.\n\nBut expert analysis of the race reveals how Lyles managed to pick up speed as the finish line approached.\n\nTwo-time Olympian Ashton Eaton, a mechanical engineer who won gold twice in the decathlon but now works in research and development at Nike, shared a string of data on the race. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), Eaton revealed how researchers were able to work out the runners' exact speeds using the precise location of cameras filming the race and time-stamped footage.\n\nThe analysis revealed that Lyles was in third place after 60m, but -- crucially -- he was now running his fastest at 43.5 km/h (27.02 mph). At that point, Thompson was in first place, but was running at 43.1 km/h (26.7 mph).\n\nLyles' top speed during the race was higher than any other runner (43.6 km/h or 27.09 mph), which allowed him to reach the front of the pack alongside Thompson, whose own top speed was 43.3 km/h (26.9 mph).\n\nThe two men stood together as they anxiously watched the screen immediately after the end of the race. \"Come on man!\" Thompson roared with impatience as he waited for the big screen to display the official results. Lyles told Thompson at one point: \"I think you've got the Olympics, big dog.\"\n\nHowever, the images showed that although Thompson's foot had hit the line first, Lyles' torso was marginally ahead -- and that's what counts.\n\nLyles' winning time was 9.784 seconds, while Thompson had clocked 9.789 seconds (a difference of just 0.005 seconds). The bronze medal was taken by another American, Fred Kerley, who finished in 9.81 seconds.\n\nAfter the results were announced, a stunned but delighted Lyles took off for a run around the track clutching the Stars and Stripes. Speaking to reporters afterward, he said of Thompson: \"He was in lane four, I was in lane seven, so I couldn't really see what was happening. I continued to run like I would win it. Something told me: 'I need to lean.' It is that type of race. It was crazy.\" He added: \"I am going around as the Olympic champion; I have that title as the world's fastest man. This has been years in the making.\"\n\nThompson was magnanimous in accepting second place and insisted the gold should not be shared, despite the closeness of the race was and given he was actually the first person to touch the finish line.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" he said. \"It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chloe_mayer@newsweek.com", "name": "Chloe Mayer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Eaton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashton Eaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stars and Stripes (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442827/how-noah-lyles-won-100m-olympic-title.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b4cdb83233cda1e0ff85ae4517d2f9a7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Gold medallist Noah Lyles of United States celebrates after the men's 100m final. REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier\n\nNoah Lyles talked the talk, walked the walk, and ran the race.\n\nThe 27-year-old Gainesville, FL native is the Olympic champion at the men's 100m dash at the 2024 Paris Games, ending a 20-year-old American drought in the event in a photo finish.\n\nLyles, the 2023 world champion, defeated Jamaica's Kishane Thompsom -- widely regarded as the favorite for this race -- by the slimmest of margins of 0.005 seconds (five-one-thousandths). Justin Gatlin was the last American to win gold in this race at the 2004 Games in Athens.\n\nThe finish was so close that it was Thompson who initially believed that he won the race. It was not until a short review and a tense wait that Lyles and the world learned that he was a champion when it showed the American's torso breaking over the finish line first.\n\nHis official time of 9.784 seconds was a personal best while Thompson's debut at a major competition yielded a time of 9.789 seconds.\n\nThompson's silver ensures that Jamaica's wait for a first gold since Usain Bolt's retirement continues while Fred Kerley -- a silver medalist at the Tokyo Games three years ago -- took bronze to put two Americans on the podium. Kerley's time of 9.81 seconds was a season-best for him and just two-one-hundredths of a second back of the top two.\n\nLyles did not win either of his qualifying races in Paris but remained as confident as ever.\n\n\"It wasn't tougher. I was more expecting that they would just fall in line and they didn't,\" Lyles said leading up to the race. \"They took it as 'I got one shot and I'm going to take it.' And to be honest, I should have expected that knowing that this is the Olympics. But this is my first time in an Olympic 100. I didn't. That's on me and I won't let that happen again.\"\n\nSouth Africa's Akani Simbine finished just one-hundredth of a second behind Kerley for bronze while the defending Olympic 100m champion, Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs, finished fifth with a 9.85-second sprint.\n\nA third American in the field, Kenny Bednarek, finished seventh.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He brought it with him to the Stade de France the past few days because the sight of it instantly motivates him.\n\nLyles won his first career Olympic gold medal in a photo finish on Sunday night, coming from behind to overtake Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and edge him by five-thousandths of a second. He is the first American to capture first place in the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin did it 20 years ago.\n\nThat victory could be the beginning of a transformative week for Lyles in Paris if all goes according to plan. He is a heavy favorite to win gold in the 200 this week and he is the most obvious choice to run the anchor leg in the men's 4x100-meter relay. Lyles might even talk his way into running a leg of the men's 4x400-meter relay and seizing the rare chance to win a fourth gold medal in the same Olympics.\n\nFor Lyles, the path to this moment of glory began three years ago. He doesn't achieve gold in Paris if he weren't humbled by settling for bronze in Tokyo.\n\nDuring the buildup to the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles was not in a good head space. The depression that he had dealt with when bullied as a kid had returned, fueled by the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and uncertainty surrounding when or if the postponed Tokyo Olympics would ever happen.\n\nThe mental health issues affected his performance.Lyles finished a distant seventh in the 100 final at the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. He only qualified for Tokyo in his signature 200.\n\nWhen Lyles arrived in Tokyo to find empty stadiums, strict COVID protocols and minimal support from family or friends, his mental health further deteriorated. Standing on the starting line, staring at nothing but empty seats before the men's 200 final, track's ultimate showman remembers thinking, \"This is not fun. This is not it.\"\n\nLyles, then 24 and already the best 200-meter runner in the world, finished third in the 200 that day, then just his second career loss at that distance as a professional. He uncharacteristically couldn't hold a slim lead as he rounded the curve and let Canada's Andre De Grasse and fellow American Kenny Bednarek overtake him.\n\nWhen Lyles spoke to reporters that night, he called his bronze medal \"boring.\" He sobbed as he talked about his own mental health struggles, about antidepressants causing him to gain weight, about having to cycle off that medication to prepare for Olympic Trials.\n\nLyles returned home saying to himself, \"I've got to change. I've got to evolve.\" Recommitting to therapy, he says, is what made the biggest difference for him. Therapy helped him overcome his crippling fears of returning to the track, to convert the disappointment of Tokyo into fuel for future success and to lay out a psychological game plan for race days.\n\nWhereas before he felt pressure to live up to other people's expectations or anxious before big races, now Lyles says he tries to frame it as if he is \"extremely curious as to what is going to happen.\"\n\n\"That's how me and my therapist phrase it,\" he said, smiling. \"I'm curious what I'm going to do. How am I going to pull this off?\"\n\nThe change that Lyles wanted to see didn't take years or even months. It took weeks. Only a month after the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles ran a world-leading time in the 200 at the Prefontaine Classic. He followed that up in 2022 by eclipsing Michael Johnson's American record in the 200 and last year by pulling off the rare sprint treble at World Championships last year.\n\nWhen another Olympic year arrived, Lyles this time has been ready to seize the moment. The motivation that he has needed is his unwanted Tokyo keepsake.\n\n\"I'll be like, 'Yeah, I think I'm doing enough,\" Lyles said earlier this summer. \"Then I turn around and look at the medal -- 'All right, back to work.'\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when timing didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAnd 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\n___\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNoah Lyles finished behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the semifinal of the Olympic 100 meters Sunday but still advanced for a rematch in the gold-medal race later in the evening.\n\nSeville is now 2-0 this season against Lyles after finishing in 9.81 seconds, good for a .02-second margin over the American champion.\n\nSeville got off to a stronger start than Lyles, and the American made up ground over the last 40 meters but couldn't completely close the gap. Lyles also lost his opening-round heat -- to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe on Saturday. Hinchliffe finished third in the semifinal and did not advance.\n\nJoining Lyles in the eight-man final will be Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won his semifinal in 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in the three semifinal. Thompson also has the world's best time this year at 9.77; he and Seville are trying to put Jamaica back on top of the Olympic podium for the first time since Usain Bolt retired after the 2016 Games.\n\nDefending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy finished third in the second semifinal and advanced because his 9.92 was the best among sprinters who didn't automatically qualify by finishing in the top two in their heats.\n\nAlso in the final will be Americans Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and South Africa's Akani Simbine.\n\nOther gold medals on the line Sunday night at the Stade de France are in men's hammer throw and women's high jump, where Yaroslava Mahuchikh tries to bring Olympic gold to her war-torn home country of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri":

I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles' victory was only confirmed after a photo-finish.\n\nThe American said of the wait for the final results: \"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, bro, I think you had that one'.\n\n\"And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nLyles added: \"It's been a rollercoaster, ups and downs.\n\n\"I'm usually a guy who likes to come out blazing in all my rounds, especially in the 200m. But the 100m, it's my first time here on the Olympic stage.\"\n\nNot 'fresh enough'\n\nThe relatively unknown Thompson, the fastest man this year with a best of 9.77sec, said he hadn't been \"fresh enough\" over the final 30 metres.\n\n\"I couldn't really see Lyles, I wasn't sure,\" 23-year-old Thompson said of the photo-finish. \"It was that close.\n\n\"I'm going to take it and move forward from here,\" he said. \"Everybody loves a winner so I would have loved to win today, but I loved the competition overall.\"\n\nLyles' U.S. teammate Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81sec, just one-hundredth ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who timed 9.82sec.\n\n\"I don't feel any frustration because I'm facing the best in the world,\" said Kerley, the 2022 world champion and Olympic silver medallist over 100m three years ago at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"At the end of the day, not many people can say they came to the Olympic Games,\" Kerley said. \"Whoever came off the best is the best. It's my second time around and I'm going off with a medal.\"\n\nIn an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85sec, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86sec, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88sec and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91sec.\n\nStarting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern.\n\nHead tucked down through to the 40-metre mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way.\n\nAs Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nTense buildup\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters adjusted their starting blocks.\n\nThe lights then went off and the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum, with each sprinter individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable, while the only sound was that of a helicopter whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track to the dramatic denouement.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.\n\nAsked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt.\n\n\"100 percent,\" he said. \"That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to take it to the 200.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source":

Noah Lyles talked an awful lot of talk in the build-up to Paris 2024, but tonight he backed up the bluster with blistering speed on the Stade de France track, surging past the field to pip them all on the line. There can be no argument now. \"What's the title of Olympic champion?\" Lyles said, referring to \"the fastest man on the planet\" tag that goes with gold. \"Amen.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter that he didn't get near the world record he said he'd break, finishing in 9.79. It doesn't matter that the winning margin was only five thousandths of a second, a time too miniscule to comprehend.

It also cements Lyles as the premier American superstar in this sport as the charismatic 27-year-old sprinter had already been one of the top faces of track and field with his blazing speed and viral moments.\n\nThompson, who was the betting favorite in the race, took the silver medal and American Fred Kerley took home the bronze.\n\nIt was a sterling version of the signature Olympic race. Taking place on the same night as the women's high jump final and the men's hammer throw final, along with qualifying heats in multiple other races, the showpiece event didn't begin until all those other competitions were done for the day.\n\nWhen the time came, the lights went out in the Stade de France just as the sun had nearly set. And then it lit back up as wristbands on the 80,000 spectators in the stadium began to flash, creating another one of the dazzling light shows that these Paris Olympics are becoming known for.\n\nEach competitor received an introduction, but Lyles took it like no other, bounding nearly halfway down the track to hype up the crowd and let off a little emotion. Lyles has gone viral in the past for such pre-race moves like pulling out Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before key races, but this time it was only his energy on display.\n\nWhen all the competitors had entered the track, they stood waiting for what felt like an eternity as dramatic music played throughout the stadium.\n\nEventually, the music stopped and the competitors settled into the starting blocks. The stadium fell completely silent - tens of thousands and all one could hear was the wind - before the horn sounded. A mighty roar cut the tension as the sprinters hung together in a tight pack through the first 50 meters of the race.\n\nThere was some separation in the back half of the less-than-10-second contest - the first 100-meter Olympic final in which running a 10-second qualifying heat would not guarantee passage to the final race and the first where every competitor ran sub-10 seconds with a legal wind, according to World Athletics - but not nearly enough for it to be clear who won when the runners crossed the finish line.\n\nThe pack of panting sprinters gathered at the northeastern bend in the track, doubled over catching their breath while they stared up at the big screen, waiting for results. For a while, it only read \"Photo,\" indicating a photo finish.\n\nAnd then the update came through: Lyles had done it.\n\nHe took off again, bounding around the track in ecstasy.\n\nThat photo finish makes it one of the most incredible and dramatic 100-meter races in Olympic history.\n\nThe final times - Lyles finishing in 9.784 seconds, Thompson in 9.789 - tell the story neatly. But it's not the whole tale, given Lyles' qualifying rounds over the last two days.\n\nThe American finished second in both the first round and the semifinal qualifiers, seeming to do just enough to get to the final race but being underwhelming enough for fans to wonder if all of Lyles' bravado was going to be overmatched on this biggest of stages.\n\nLyles said afterward that he was convinced Thompson had beat him to the line.\n\n\"It was a crazy moment because, like I said, I did think that because Kishane had that and I was like, 'Man, I really, you know, have to swallow my pride,' which I don't have a problem doing because respect deserves respect,\" he said.\n\nBut when his name popped up on the board first, he knew he'd earned the right to celebrate a bit.\n\n\"I was like, I didn't do this against a slow field. I did this against the best of the best on the biggest stage with the biggest pressure. And seeing the names, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, there it is.'\"\n\nThompson, meanwhile, crushed the competition in each of his races, simply on cruise control until he reached the final. His nation's long history of sprinting success and his own cool demeanor appeared to be enough wind at his back to get him across the finish line first.\n\nThompson put the defeat on himself, telling reporters that he didn't trust himself enough.\n\n\"I really beat myself today in that I didn't trust myself and my speed to bring myself to the line in first place,\" he said, giving kudos to Lyles and the rest of the field for pushing him.\n\nThe American champion is hoping Sunday night's result is just the start of a historic Games - and he won't have a lot of time to rest on his laurels.\n\nLyles' signature race - this was his first time running the 100m at the Olympics - is the 200-meters and qualification for that distance begins on Monday morning.\n\nHe's also aiming to add a pair of relay medals on his neck - the men's 4x100-meter relay and possibly the 4x400-meter relay, if he's chosen for the team.\n\nLyles' confidence after the race for the rest of the Olympics is - not surprisingly - sky-high.\n\n\"I'll just leave it there, I'll be winning,\" he said.\n\n\"None of them are winning,\" he added of the 200-meter field. \"When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Noah Lyles, of the United States, won, Thompson was second and Kerley third.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- Kishane Thompson let out a scream after crossing the finish line that was fitting of an Olympic 100-meter champion. Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Sunday night. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner -- with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said. \"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said. \"It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,\" he said. \"Everybody loves winners.\"\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish. Thompson knew it was close and immediately glanced at the scoreboard for an answer.\n\nHe waited. They all waited.\n\nLyles gave him a glimmer of hope, though.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I even said, 'Bro, I think you got that one big dog. And then my name popped up, and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\"\n\nThompson became the first Jamaican to be on the podium in the men's Olympic 100 since Bolt's run of three straight titles in 2008, '12 and '16.\n\n\"My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad,\" Thompson said. \"I'm super grateful.\"\n\nThompson entered the race with the fastest time of the season and was viewed as the biggest threat to Lyles. It came down to the wire with all eight sprinters separated by a margin of .12 seconds -- and even closer for gold and silver.\n\n\"That close,\" Thompson said. \"It was that close.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@register-herald.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianmarco_Tamberi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianmarco Tamberi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutaz_Essa_Barshim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutaz Essa Barshim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/af/7af7f25e-834f-5134-b764-b3db3a7b4c5f/66b0073a77f70.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nThompson hoped to be the first Jamaican man since Bolt to win a global 100m title.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" he said, \"I've just got to take it as it is and move forward from here.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and myself, I should have let my speed bring me to the line. I've learned from it. I couldn't see Noah, but I think he could see me and said, 'hey, Kishane, I thought you got it'. But I wasn't sure, he was too far to my right, so I wasn't sure. This is my closest race.

He just needs to improve by 1%.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles is the fastest man in the world.\n\nThe U.S. sprinter won the 100 at the Paris Olympics. Lyles crossed the finish line with a gold-medal winning time of 9.79 in a photo finish to win track and field's marquee sprint event.\n\nKishane Thompson ran a 9.79 to finish second and Fred Kerley came in third, posting a time of 9.81 to get bronze.\n\nThe runners had to wait for photo review moments after the race and didn't know who won seconds after the race.\n\nBut the moment belonged to Lyles inside a packed house at Stade de France. Lyles is the first American sprinter to win an Olympic gold medal in the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin won gold at the 2004 Athens Games.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" Lyles said after the race. \"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nLyles came into the Olympics confident. He ran a personal-best 9.81 at last month. He told USA TODAY Sports that he wanted to win multiple Olympic gold medals. He's well on his way to achieving his goal.\n\nThe 100 victory earned Lyles his first ever Olympic gold medal. He received a bronze in the 200 at the Tokyo Olympics. He's also a six-time world champion gold medalist, but Sunday's Olympic gold medal in the 100 might be the crowning achievement of his career thus far.\n\n\u27a4 Get Olympics updates in your texts!

He's in the sixth heat with Jamaica's Bryan Levell and Canada's Andre De Grasse, the defending 200-meter champion from Tokyo. De Grasse did not qualify for the 100 final. The first heat starts at 7:55 p.m. Monday in Paris (1:55 p.m. ET). The top three in each heat advance to the semifinals, which are Wednesday.\n\nKeisha Caine Bishop on Noah Lyles' dreams of turning pro\n\nNoah Lyles' mother knew her sons' dream of becoming professional track stars when they were still teenagers.\n\n\"In 10th grade they wanted to go professional out of high school and I was like are you crazy,\" Keisha Caine Bishop, the mother of Noah and Josephus, told USA TODAY Sports this summer.\n\nIn July 2016 when Noah was 19 years old, he and his younger brother, Josephus, 18 at the time, turned professional and signed a contract with Adidas instead of competing collegiately for the University of Florida.\n\n\"I had to go back and apologize,\" Caine Bishop said. \"I realized that's not fair to kill somebody's dream, especially if they are willing to do the work, and they were willing to do the work.\"\n\nNoah and Josephus have been running professionally since. Josephus isn't on the Olympic team in Paris but ran the 100 and 200 at Olympic trials. - Tyler Dragon\n\nNBC broadcaster incorrectly calls 100 meters race winner\n\nIf you thought Noah Lyles missed out on the gold medal in the 100-meter dash, you weren't the only one.\n\nNBC broadcaster Leigh Diffey was into the moment like the rest of the audience taking in the 100 meters, but he seemed a bit more decisive with his call than what the eye told. As the sprinters crossed the line, the cameras panned to Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson and Diffey declared Thompson the winner, not Lyles.\n\n\"Jamaica's gonna do it, Kishane Thompson is a gold medalist, on debut,\" Diffey declared, before going silent.\n\nThe competitors were all huddled waiting for photo evidence of the finish. When the photo did come in, it was Lyles who was the winner of the race, by just thousandths of a second over Thompson.\n\nLyles' victory secures the USA's first gold medal in the 100 meter in 20 years, and solidifies his standing as the fastest man in the world. - Joseph Rivera\n\nAccording to World Athletics, it's the first time in history that eight men have broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal race.\n\nUSA's Juliette Whittaker makes it through to 800 final\n\nJuliette Whittaker will be the only American woman in the 800-meter final after squeaking through the semifinals Sunday night.\n\nWhittaker, 20, nabbed the third and final 800-meter spot on Team USA at the Olympic trials but is now the only one of them left. Allie Wilson did not make it out of the first round, and Nia Akins fell short in the semifinals.\n\nAfter making the final and running a personal best of 1 minute, 57.76 seconds, Whittaker said she feels like she's playing with house money now.\n\n\"I think I'm just so excited now just to see what I can do tomorrow, without any expectation,\" she said. \"Even if I get last in the final, I will be overjoyed just to make it that far. So yeah, I'm just excited.\" - Tom Schad\n\n3 Americans qualify for men's 1500-meter final\n\nThere will be plenty of red, white and blue in the men's 1500-meter final.\n\nAll three Americans left in the field qualified for the final, with Yared Nuguse and Hobbs Kessler finishing first and second in one of the two semifinals to advance. Both ran under 3 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nCole Hocker also cruised into the final after placing third in his semi and spending most of the race shadowing two of the medal favorites: Jacob Ingebrigsten of Norway and Josh Kerr of Great Britain.\n\n\"That was just the very last bit of confidence that I needed, heading into the final,\" said Hocker, who ran collegiately at Oregon. - Tom Schad\n\nUSA's Vashti Cunningham finishes fifth in women's high jump\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - Team USA women's high jumper Vashti Cunningham missed out on a medal for the third consecutive Olympics Sunday. Still, despite a troubling back injury this season, she recorded her highest Olympic finish ever (fifth place). The daughter of former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham cleared the bar at 1.86, 1.91 and 1.95 meters, but failed on three attempts to clear 1.98 to fall out of medal contention.\n\nThe gold medal went to Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who cleared 2.0 meters in fewer attempts than silver medalist Nicola Olyslagers of Australia. Ukrainian Iryna Gerashchenko and Australia's Eleanor Patterson tied for the bronze.\n\nCunningham narrowly qualified for the Paris Olympics, but entered ranked No. 7 in the world. She recorded finishes of 13th at the Rio Games in 2016 and sixth at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\n\"I felt good about my performance. I was happy when I made the bar and when I missed the bar, I knew what I was doing wrong,\" Cunningham said. \"I just need to go back to the drawing board and work on a few things.\"\n\nAsked if she's committed to making a run at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, Cunningham said, \"Absolutely. I'm only going to be 30 years old, guys.\" - Chase Goodbread\n\nWeather forecast for 100 final\n\nThere is no rain in the forecast for the men's 100 final. It's expected to be slightly cloudy and 71 degrees at the start of the race. The women's sprinters in Saturday's 100 final had to deal with rainy conditions.\n\nAll three American sprinters advance to 100 final\n\nNoah Lyles, Fred Kerley and Kenny Bednarek all advanced to the 100 showdown Sunday night. Lyles and Kerley placed second in their respective heats. Bednarek qualified on time.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson (9.80) and Oblique Seville (9.81) have the top times entering the final.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson won his third and final heat at 9.80 in what was a quick semifinal. Fred Kerley placed second at 9.84 to get the second automatic qualifying spot.\n\nNoah Lyles second in heat, qualifies for 100 final\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles is going to have to make some adjustments ahead of the 100 final.\n\nLyles placed second his first semifinal heat, running a 9.83. Jamaica's Oblique Seville won the heat and looked at Lyles as he crossed the finish line in a personal-best time of 9.81.\n\nLyles lost to Great Britain's Louie Hinchliffe in the opening round. But all that matters is he qualified for Sunday's final.\n\nThe top two from each heat plus the next two fastest times advance to the final.\n\nHow many events is Noah Lyles going to run at Paris Olympics?\n\nNoah Lyles is slated to run the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay.\n\nQuincy Hall, Michael Norman, Christopher Bailey advance to 400 semis\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- All three Team USA runners advanced in the men's 400.\n\nChristopher Bailey took second in the first heat of the men's 400 to move on to the semifinal. Heat No. 1 also featured Great Britian's Matthew Hudson-Smith who has the fastest time in the world this year (43.74). Hudson-Smith won the first heat timing at 44.78.\n\nMichael Norman ran a fast 44.10 to win the second heat.\n\nQuincy Hall, the U.S. Olympic track and field trials gold medalist, sped by Australia's Reece Holder down the home stretch and crossed the line with a first-place time of 44.28 in the fourth heat.\n\nThe top three in each heat automatically advanced to Tuesday's semifinal round. Norman qualified to the semifinal with the fastest time.\n\nWhat time does Noah Lyles run the 100 semifinals?\n\nThe semifinal in the 100 is at 2:05 p.m. ET. Lyles is in the first heat and will run in lane No. 4.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson is the fastest man in the world this year with a world-leading time of 9.77. Thompson eased up in the opening round in Paris and still ran a 10.00 to finish first in his heat. Thompson's Jamaican teammate, Oblique Seville, has defeated Lyles before and can make the podium.\n\nLyles' American teammates, Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, are threats to reach the podium. Bednarek and Kerley both ran 9.97 to advance to the semis.\n\nThe defending Olympic champ, Marcell Jacobs of Italy, can't be counted out, either.\n\nWhat is world record in 100?\n\nThe world record in the 100 is 9.58 set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009.\n\nWhat is Olympic record in the 100?\n\nUsain Bolt ran 9.63 to win a gold medal and set the Olympic record at the 2012 London Games.\n\nLast time American won gold medal in men's 100 at Olympics\n\nJustin Gatlin was the last American male to win an Olympic gold medal in the 100. Gatlin won gold at the 2004 Athens Games. Team USA's best medal in the 100 since then has been silver medals won at the 2016 Olympics (Gatlin) and 2020 Games (Fred Kerley).", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Sunday night.\n\nTheir times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner - with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n'I'm a bit disappointed,' Thompson said. 'But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.'\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nKishane Thompson admitted disappointment after losing out in the men's 100m final\n\nAmerican Noah Lyles pipped Thompson by five-thousandths of a second to win the gold\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n'I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,' the 23-year-old Thompson said. 'It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.'\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n'I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,' he said. 'Everybody loves winners.'\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish. Thompson knew it was close and immediately glanced at the scoreboard for an answer.\n\nHe waited. They all waited.\n\nA photo finish was needed to separate both athletes - with Lyles clinching the win after leaning\n\nLyles believed Thompson had initially done enough before his name appeared on the screens\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nLyles gave him a glimmer of hope, though.\n\n'I did think Thompson had it at the end,' Lyles said. 'I even said, \"Bro, I think you got that one big dog\". And then my name popped up, and I'm like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm amazing\".'\n\nThompson became the first Jamaican to be on the podium in the men's Olympic 100m since Bolt's run of three straight titles in 2008, '12 and '16.\n\n'My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad,' Thompson said. 'I'm super grateful.'\n\nThompson entered the race with the fastest time of the season and was viewed as the biggest threat to Lyles. It came down to the wire with all eight sprinters separated by a margin of .12 seconds - and even closer for gold and silver.\n\n'That close,' Thompson said.

On Sunday, in a stunning display of speed and athleticism, the sprinter etched his name in the annals of history, becoming the fastest man in the world. Noah Lyles bagged the closest-ever Olympics 100m finals win, emerging victorious by only five-thousandths of a second. Initially, Lyles believed he had left it too late to catch the powerful Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson. Clips showed the 27-year-old walking to the Jamaican to congratulate him after the race. However, the results appeared on the big screen one after the other, with Lyles earning the gold medal.\n\nIt turns out he crossed the finish line in 9.784 seconds, ahead of Thompson's 9.79 seconds by the width of a vest. The 27-year-old's victory marked the first time an American bagged the Olympic gold medal for the 100m finals since Justin Gaitlin in 2004. Speaking about his victory during an interview, Noah Lyles said it was the 100m finals Olympic gold medal he wanted.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents. I didn't do this against a slow field - I did this against the best of the best,\" he said.\n\nLyles wasn't wrong, considering that the race was the first time in history that seven men crossed the finish line in under 9.90 seconds. Following his breathtaking victory, Lyles took to social media with an inspirational message. In a tweet, Lyles let the world know he was battling various health issues. However, he encouraged his followers not to let their challenges define what they could become.\n\n\"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\" he wrote.\n\nLyles's words touched many, who took to the comments section to air their thoughts.

Races are judged on whose chest is first through the tape, with American Lyles winning by a wafer-thin margin of 0.005 seconds in a race in which he was last until nearly 50m. Here is how he did it.\n\nThe walkout\n\nLyles, predictably, had made the most eye-catching of arrivals, sprinting down as far as the 40m line when he was announced into the stadium. Plenty of people watching wondered if he should conserve some energy but, clearly wanting to be the showman that the men's 100m has lacked ever since Usain Bolt, he continued his high-energy antics.\n\nThe start line\n\nThe wait between the athletes arriving out on the track and the actual start of the race felt interminable. Lengthy introductions, booming music, a spectacular light show, darkness and then a longer than anticipated wait for the bulbs inside the Stade de France to reach optimal brightness. That was even before the eight athletes had been called to their blocks to greet the silence that accompanied the starter's orders.\n\nWith Lyles's rivals having warmed themselves up with such vigour and precision on a separate track just outside the Stade de France, there was a theory that the wait might have particularly affected the two Jamaican sprinters, Oblique Seville and Thompson. They had looked capable of running so much faster in the heats and, while nerves may also have been a factor, they looked tight by comparison.\n\nOut of the blocks\n\nLyles has never been a fast starter and, true to form, his reaction time from when the gun sounded and his feet actually left the blocks was the joint slowest in the entire field at 0.178sec. Thompson was crucially not much faster, ensuring that Fred Kerley, who was largely unfancied for gold, took an instant lead.\n\nSprinters then vary greatly in how long they keep their heads down but this next part of the race was excellent for Thompson who, by 30m, had taken the lead and was moving faster than anyone at 40.6km per hour. Lyles, who was now just touching that same speed, had taken much longer to get there and was actually still last out of all eight runners even at 30m.\n\nRace-changing middle\n\nLyles had made the unexpected decision earlier this year to turn up at the World Indoor Championships and take on Christian Coleman, the best 60m runner in history over the distance. He could not win, but it was a critical decision for what would follow here in Paris. Knowing that he was the fastest finisher, Lyles desperately wanted to shorten the moment between the start of the race and when he was upright out of the 'drive phase' and ready to launch into full flight.\n\nThis transition was not instantly noticeable during the race, with Lyles still trailing Thompson at 40m but making crucial inroads into the rest of the field. By halfway, he had reached 43.5kph - almost his top speed during the race - which is quicker than anyone else managed through the full 100m. It meant that he had moved from eighth to third between 30m and 60m. This meant that it was now simply a question of holding his form and hoping that there would be enough track to complete his surge through the field.\n\nLightning finale\n\nLyles had reached overdrive by 60m, peaking at 43.6kpm in the 10m to 70m, which is at the moment when those 100m specialists in front of him were starting to struggle to hold their form and just faltering into the final metres. What Lyles did brilliantly here, however, was to maintain his concentration, keep relaxed and not allow the desperation that he would have felt at still not quite hitting the front to impact his running. He calls the 200m \"his wife\" and the 100m \"his mistress\" and knew that he just needed to stay faithful to his old instincts that had been honed from years of running over the longer sprint.\n\nIt was a masterful display of nerve and mind over matter just as much as pure physical speed or power. Yes, it was something that he had practised endlessly with his coach but to actually deliver it in front of a watching world was extraordinary.\n\nThe finish line\n\nFew people are more sure of themselves than Lyles, but even he suspected that Thompson had won following a blanket finish. Incredibly, the scoreboard said that seven of the finalists were in the photo-finish and there was an agonising 20 seconds while they all just stopped and looked up at the big screen. The only finishing time that had been recorded was that of Seville, who was eighth, despite looking so dominant in beating Lyles in their semi-final.\n\nAnd then the result flashed up, Lyles's eyes almost popped out of his head to confirm that, by an almost unimaginably fine margin, he was the Olympic champion.\n\nThe difference between Lyles (9.784) and Thompson (9.789) was a ludicrously microscopic five thousandths of a second. The subsequent overhead photo showed that Thompson's foot had actually crossed the line first but Lyles's superior lean into the finish line had sealed it for him.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_wilson@aol.co.uk", "name": "Jeremy Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Indoor_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Indoor Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qP69zyJltJLPMk83VYcryw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/bdcc15e3d841bffc502efd0a3c809cd7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

If you don't, you don't\" Noah Lyles said when questioned about the criticism he had been receiving during the entire 2024 season.\n\nThe 27-year-old defied all odds by winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 meters, and according to his post-race interview on SportsMax TV on YouTube, he didn't dislike anyone simply because they share different opinions, even if negative ones, towards him.\n\n\"I'm not going to hate anybody that doesn't like me.\"\n\nThe sportsman made it clear that he never had or will ever have a personal grudge against anyone in the community. However, Lyles also encouraged them to never discourage anyone from pursuing their personal goals.\n\nLyles suggested that if someone doesn't like a particular athlete, they should focus on admiring those they do appreciate rather than engaging in trash talk. The newly crowned Olympic champion expressed gratitude for individuals who acknowledged him and turned their criticisms into support.\n\nLyles also praised the incredible crowd at the Stade de France and the opponents who pushed him to his limits. The 100-meter final was one of the most hotly contested events at the Paris Olympics, resulting in a photo finish that surprised the track world.\n\nAmong the fierce competition, one rival stood out as a particular threat to Lyles' Olympic ambitions.\n\nKishane Thompson emerged as a clear favorite entering the 100-meter sprint finals at the Paris Olympics. After dominating the semifinals, fans anticipated an effortless Jamaican victory.\n\nFrom the starting gun, all athletes on the track demonstrated incredible speed. Thompson took an early lead, pulling ahead of the competition. As the Jamaican approached the final stretch, he noticed Lyles surging forward.\n\nThe American and his rival both clocked 9.79 seconds. However, Lyles finished just 0.005 seconds ahead of Thompson, securing the 100-meter Olympic gold medal and being the first one to win this event following Justin Gatlin's triumph at the 2004 Athens Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2004_Summer_Paralympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/088c7e92-noah-lyles-3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

What to know of track star who won 100m gold at Paris Olympics", "body": "After a disappointing performance in 2021, a fire was lit under Noah Lyles to become the fastest man in the world. He just needs to improve by 1%.\n\nUnited States sprinter Noah Lyles solidified his stance as the fastest man in the world on Sunday, narrowly outrunning the field for the 100-meter sprint at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nLyles, who became the first U.S. man to win a gold medal in the Olympic event since Justin Gatlin in 2004, beat out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a photo finish. Lyles won the race by five thousandths of a second, running a 9.784 to Thompson's 9.789.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS: Follow USA TODAY's full coverage here\n\nThe 27-year-old Lyles earned his first Olympic gold medal with the win, nabbing his second medal overall at the Olympics in the process.\n\nAdding to the already-impressive nature of his accomplishment is the fact he was able to achieve it with a respiratory condition -- one that would presumably make sprinting at the highest level the world can offer that much harder.\n\nHere's everything to know about Lyles' asthma condition:\n\nDoes Noah Lyles have asthma?\n\nYes, Lyles experiences asthma -- a respiratory condition that affects the airways in the lungs, causing a difficulty to breathe. He is one of several Olympic athletes in Paris who has the condition, as noted by the American Lung Association.\n\nLyles has suffered from the condition since he was a child, which even caused him to be homeschooled, he told CNN in 2020.\n\n\"Asthma definitely affects kind of everything I do in terms of health, physical fitness, sometimes even emotional because if you're emotionally fatigued, that can bring your immune system down,\" Lyles told CNN at the time.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Did Noah Lyles win today? Here's how Lyles finished in 100-meter dash, highlights\n\nAccording to a July 31 report from ESPN, Lyles first experienced symptoms related to asthma at 3 years old, when he had coughing fits.\n\n\"He couldn't eat without coughing. He couldn't play,\" Keisha Caine Bishop, Lyles' mother, told ESPN. \"His quality of life went down.\"\n\nESPN reports that a doctor determined Lyles had reactive airway disease. It wasn't until Lyles was 5 years old that he was diagnosed with asthma, which led his mother to make changes around their home and in his diet to reduce the risk of attack. Lyles had surgery to remove his tonsils and adenoids when he was 7 years old, significantly improving his quality of breath -- and letting him play tag with his friends.\n\n\"Everybody starts scattering, because they know that somebody's about to be it, and it could be them at any moment that I choose,\" Lyles told ESPN.\n\nEven as Lyles' condition improved as he got older, asthma still adversely affected him, particularly after races. ESPN notes that, as a freshman in high school, Lyles would return home from competition exhausted, often causing him to miss school on Mondays to recover from races run over the weekend. In response, Lyles took vitamins and supplements to build up his lungs, following advice doctors gave his mother.\n\nESPN reports that, in 2016, Lyles' asthma attacks \"largely subsided\" due to supplements and USATF-approved medication.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Head bone connected to the clavicle bone and then a gold medal for sprinter Noah Lyles\n\nWhat is asthma?\n\nAccording to the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute, asthma is defined as \"a chronic (long-term) condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. This makes it harder for air to flow out of your airways when you breathe out.\"\n\nThe condition affects 1 in 13 people in the United States, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and can affect people of all ages. As noted by the CDC, it often starts in childhood.\n\nIt has no cure, but can be mitigated with monitoring, trigger avoidance and medication.\n\nNoah Lyles photo finish\n\nLyles won the 100-meter at the 2024 Paris Olympics in a photo finish on Sunday, narrowly beating Jamaica's Thompson (silver medal) and the United States' Fred Kerley (bronze).\n\nHere's the photo-finish result and the times by

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81 and defending champion Marcell Jacobs finished fifth.\n\nThis was the closest 100-meter since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever.

Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAnd 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite

For these Games, it introduced the Scan'O'Vision Ultimate photo finish camera, which replaced the Scan'O'Vision Myria camera used previously.\n\nThe Myria could record 10,000 digital images per second to separate a crunch of humans crossing a finish line at once. The Ultimate can capture 40,000 per second.\n\nThey needed it.\n\nWhen the eight finalists in the men's 100 meters leaned all at once, then looked to the Stade de France's giant video board, this is what they saw next to the top seven finishers' names: Photo, Photo, Photo, Photo, Photo, Photo, Photo.\n\nAfter several nervous moments, one name appeared on top: Noah Lyles.\n\nThat's how the U.S. Olympic men's sprint drought ended, with Lyles edging Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by .005, or 5/1000ths of a second. Or about 2 inches on the track.\n\nIt's the closest 100 final since at least the boycotted 1980 Olympic Games, when Great Britain's Allan Wells and Cuba's Sylvio Leonard both were given times of 10.25 since they didn't have the capacity to extend them to the thousandths of seconds.\n\n\"We were waiting for the names to come up, and I (told Thompson), 'I gotta be honest, I think you got that one, big dog,'\" Lyles said. \"He was out in Lane 4. I was in Lane 7. I couldn't really see what was going on over there. I just had to keep running. Something said: 'I need to lean.'\"\n\nFellow American Fred Kerley in Lane 3 actually had the first body part cross the finish line, an orange shoe on his right foot. But in track, it's the torso that matters, and Lyles' just beat Thompson's, 9.784 to 9.789 seconds. Kerley was third in 9.81.\n\nSouth Africa's Akani Simbine was fourth at 9.82, followed by Tokyo champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy at 9.85 and Botswana's Letsile Tebogo at 9.86. The entire eight-man field, in fact, was all 9.91 or under, separated by a mere .12 seconds.\n\nContext: When Usain Bolt won his first 100 gold in 2008 in Beijing, he crossed a full .20 seconds ahead of second place.\n\nLyles and the Americans aren't complaining. Photo finish or boat race, it's a gold medal in the men's sprints for the nation that once dominated them. Finally.\n\nIn the 20 unboycotted Summer Games between 1912 and 2004, the American men won at least one of the three sprint events -- 100, 200 or 4\u00d7100 relay -- in 19 of them. Entering Sunday night, they had gone four straight Olympics without winning any of them. The last 100 gold was by Justin Gatlin in 2004 in Athens (and he later ran afoul of anti-doping regulations).\n\nBut to Lyles, at least by his words and actions, this was less about winning for his country than winning for his ego.\n\nWhen his name appeared on the video board above Thompson, Lyles pulled his bib number with \"LYLES\" across it, held it aloft and skipped down the backstretch and around the far turn near the start. Nearly all medalists first go to the crowd and retrieve a flag to celebrate with.\n\nIt wasn't until a few minutes later that Kerley, with a flag draped over his head, ran to Lyles and handed him one folded up. Lyles didn't immediately unfurl it or continue the victory lap with his fellow American, instead motioning photographers to run across the infield with him for a photo by himself.\n\n\"I hope you guys like Noah,\" Lyles said later, \"because I've got a lot more coming.\"\n\nThe 100 meters was considered the hardest of the three golds Lyles targeted in Paris. He's won the last three world titles in the 200, his best event, and the U.S. is favored in the 4\u00d7100 relay with three Americans making the individual 100 final (although there's always the matter of getting the baton around the track without, ahem, dropping it).\n\nLyles won all three at the World Championships last summer in Budapest, Hungary.\n\n\"Pretty confident, I can't lie,\" he said of the 200, next up on the Paris schedule. \"My job is to make sure that, I'll just leave it there. I'll be winning.\"\n\nKerley, sitting next to him at the medalists' news conference, interjected: \"Talk your (smack), man.\"\n\nLyles continued: \"That man ain't winning. None of them is winning. When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.\"\n\nPart of Lyles' bravado is his personality. Part of it, though, is marketing, a calculated quest to raise the sport's fading profile through showmanship and celebrity.\n\nIn a recent profile in Time magazine, Lyles chronicles his negotiations with Adidas for a shoe contract and receiving an invitation to a sneaker-release event for Minnesota Timberwolves star (and U.S. Olympic team member) Anthony Edwards. And declining.\n\n\"You want to do what?\" Lyles told Time. \"You want to invite me to (an event for) a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don't even care about? And you're giving him a shoe? ... All I'm asking is, 'How could you not see that for me?'\"\n\nLyles eventually signed an endorsement deal with Adidas, and Sunday he renewed his call for a signature sneaker line.\n\nNot a track spike. A sneaker.\n\n\"Dead serious,\" Lyles said. \"I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes. There's money in sneakers. Even (former 200 and 400 world-record holder) Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, the notoriety we get, the fact that it hasn't happened is crazy to me. Yeah, that needs to happen.\"\n\nNot asking for signature sneaker was Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, the world-record holder who now has a gold medal. She just wants peace.\n\nIt was one of three medals claimed by Ukraine on a day only nine were awarded, with fellow high jumper Iryna Gerashchenko and men's hammer thrower Mykhaylo Kokhan both getting bronzes.\n\n\"We won medals for our Ukrainian people and for our defenders,\" Makuchikh said. \"It's really important. For our athletes, it gives us (a stage) to talk about our situation, to talk about the war in Ukraine because we want peace. Unfortunately, it's not possible, even while the Olympic Games are going on, because Russia took a lot of rocket attacks to my city and to all cities in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's really tough.\"\n\nRancho Bernardo High School alum Nia Akins ran the women's 800-meter semifinals and just missed advancing. The top two finishers in each of three semis get a spot in the eight-woman final, plus the next two fastest times.\n\nAkins, at 1:58.20, had the third fastest time.\n\n\"It just didn't work out today,\" said Akins, 26, who qualified for Paris by winning the U.S. Olympic Trials. \"I was just trying to listen to my body and run the fastest race I could. That's all I had. It happens sometimes. I think I raced it to the best of my ability, stayed out of trouble, moved at all the right times. It's just some good competition out there and it wasn't my day.\n\n\"I've reached the point in my faith where, if it's not God's will, it's not God's will. That's unfortunately the luck of the draw. If He doesn't want it for me, I don't want it, either.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I ran 9.83 [in the semi-final].\n\n\"I hope you guys like Noah because I've got a lot more coming!\"\n\nLyles has remained outspoken and unflinching in his belief that he has the on-track ability and off-track aura to replace Usain Bolt as the new superstar of men's athletics.\n\nThe American has talked the talk but he continues to back it up when it matters most.\n\nLyles last year became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to win a 100m and 200m world double, before completing a golden treble in the 4x100m relay.\n\nLyles claimed in the build-up to the Paris Games that he would look to add the 4x400m to that haul in the French capital, and he hinted at his form when running a 100m personal best at the London Diamond League last month.\n\nBut repeating such success on these stages, under intense pressure - much of it self-imposed - is another thing entirely.\n\nHe has now become the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, and asserted himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.\n\nA three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will look to maintain his grip on the sport's major titles in that event, which starts on Monday.\n\nShould he do so, he will move a step closer to sporting immortality in his pursuit of a historic four golds at these Games.", "source": {"uri": "dailymirror.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zharnel_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zharnel Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anniversary Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_43317ab1b8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles only led one time during his Olympic 100-meter sprint for the ages: at the finish line.\n\nThere's a good argument that the rest of his stay at these Paris Games won't be anywhere near as nip-and-tuck.\n\nWith the Olympics still abuzz over his .005-second victory in the 100, Lyles didn't have much time to rest before moving to his next event. He is a heavy favorite in the 200 meters, his better race, and a race he has not lost since the Olympic final in Tokyo three years ago, where he finished third. Opening heats for the 200 were set for Monday night.\n\nLyles' willingness - make that, desire - to be the front man for a sport that yearns for new fans feels like a game-changer to Seb Coe, the World Athletics president who called Sunday's race \"if not perfect, about as close to perfect as you can get.\"\n\n\"If I'm wearing a promoter's hat, then him winning last night was important, because he's now creating a narrative that's heading us back into Usain Bolt territory,\" Coe said. \"That's hugely important.\"\n\nIn a typically candid and engaging post-race news conference, Lyles made no secret that he is in this to promote his sport, but also wants more.\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, runs across the field celebrating after winning the gold medal in in the men's 100 meters final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nHe has been a front man for the popular Netflix documentary \"SPRINT,\" and has brought a sense of fashion back to the track, making \"walk-ins\" a thing and bedazzling his hair with white pearls on race day.\n\nNow, he's got a message for his shoe sponsor, Adidas.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" he said. \"I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious. I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes, there's money in sneakers. I feel like for how many medals we bring back and the notoriety we get, the fact that hasn't happened, that's crazy for me. I feel like that needs to happen.\"\n\nThe 100 was the biggest hurdle for Lyles to overcome. It is not his best race, and it's the one he took up shortly after Tokyo with the goal of becoming more than a mere sprinter, but a larger-than-life personality, both on and off the track.\n\nLyles also figures to feature prominently in the men's 4x100 relay but that's anything but a gimme.\n\nRiddled with poor work with the baton, a lack of consistent training habits, a doping positive and the constant spectre of trying to beat Bolt, the U.S. has not won, and kept, a single Olympic medal in this event since 2004. It hasn't captured gold since 2000.\n\nThe relay is a bigger threat to Lyles' quest to win three gold medals, the way Bolt did in all three of his appearances, than the 200 meters.\n\nLyles figures to get his biggest challenge in the 200 from Kenny Bednarek, who finished ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and, more recently, pushed him at a fast Olympic trails that Lyles won in 19.53.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tobogo, American Erryion Knighton and defending champion Andre De Grasse are also in the mix. One interesting wager would be whether Lyles has more of a chance of losing the race or lowering his American record of 19.31. Bolt's world record is 19.19.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, in lane seven, wins the men's 100-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

The race was so close that it required a photo finish to determine the winner, highlighting the intense competition and high stakes of the event.\n\nThe final saw all competitors finishing under 10 seconds, a remarkable feat that had never occurred before in a race with legal wind conditions. With a downwind of 1.0 m/s, Lyles managed to edge out Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson at the finish line. The anticipation was palpable as the athletes and spectators awaited the official results, which confirmed that Lyles, a three-time world champion in Budapest 2023 (100m, 200m, and 4x100m), had won by just five thousandths of a second over Thompson. Lyles' time of 9.79 seconds was a personal record, solidifying his status as the greatest sprinter since the retirement of Usain Bolt. Thompson finished with a time of 9.79 seconds as well, but the photo finish revealed Lyles' slight advantage.\n\nFred Kerley, the world gold medalist from Eugene 2022, claimed the bronze medal with a time of 9.81 seconds. He was followed closely by South African Akani Simbine, who finished in 9.82 seconds, and the previous Olympic champion, Italian Marcel Jacobs, who clocked in at 9.85 seconds. Jacobs, unfortunately, ended the race limping and with a bandage on his left leg, indicating a possible injury.\n\nThe race's incredible closeness brought back memories of the 1980 Moscow Games, where the top two sprinters also finished within the same hundredth of a second. Back then, British sprinter Allan Wells won with a time of 10.25 seconds, narrowly defeating Cuban Silvio Leonard. An image from that race showed Wells crossing the finish line just 76 millimeters ahead of Leonard.\n\nNoah Lyles' victory marks him as a true contender for the crown of the world's fastest man, a title long held by Usain Bolt. Lyles, who will also compete in the 200m at these Games, has his sights set on achieving a second gold and potentially challenging Bolt's world record. His back-to-back victories in major competitions make him the first sprinter to achieve such a feat since Bolt's retirement.\n\nKishane Thompson, who entered the Paris Games as the fastest athlete of the year with a time of 9.77 seconds achieved at the Jamaican trials on June 28, had to settle for silver. Despite his disappointment, Thompson's performance was stellar, especially considering his impressive semifinal run where he clocked 9.80 seconds. His compatriot, Oblique Seville, who was also a strong contender with a semifinal time of 9.81 seconds, did not live up to expectations in the final and finished last with 9.91 seconds.\n\nThe semifinals were fiercely competitive, with 12 athletes running under 10 seconds. Among them was Canadian sprinter Andre De Grasse, who had previously won bronze medals in the last two Olympic Games. However, De Grasse was one of the four athletes who did not advance to the final, marking an unprecedented situation where an athlete who ran under 10 seconds in the semifinals failed to make it to the final race.\n\nNoah Lyles' triumph is not just a personal victory but also a testament to the enduring legacy of American sprinters in the 100m event. His journey to the top has been marked by dedication, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. As he prepares for the 200m race, the world will be watching to see if he can secure another gold and possibly break new records.\n\nThis historic race at the 2024 Olympics will be remembered for its remarkable display of athletic prowess, the razor-thin margins separating the top competitors, and the emergence of Noah Lyles as a dominant force in the world of sprinting. His victory, achieved under immense pressure and against a backdrop of fierce competition, underscores the incredible talent and determination that define Olympic champions. As Lyles continues to push the boundaries of speed and performance, his achievements will inspire future generations of athletes to strive for greatness.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com",

Lyles finished second in the 100-meter race with a time of 9.85. Seville clocked a world-leading and personal best time of 9.82 to win.\n\nAfter getting beat, America's fastest man declared war on his opponents.\n\nSeville turned to his right and stared Lyles down as he crossed the finish line in June. Lyles vowed to get his revenge at the Olympics.\n\nAlthough they did not see each other during the opening round heats, Lyles and Seville met in the semifinal on Saturday morning. It was tense! The Jamaican phenom doubled down on his staredown and looked the American in the eyes as he crossed the line slightly in front.\n\nLyles immediately looked right back at him.\n\nThey also shared an unfriendly hug after advancing to the final.\n\nAnd then it was time for the medal race. Noah Lyles was in lane seven. Oblique Seville was in lane six.\n\nThe gun sounded and the race was on. It was epic!\n\nLyles came from behind to snap a 20-year drought for the Americans in the 100-meter at the Olympics on a photo finish that couldn't have been closer. Five one hundredths of a second was the difference.\n\nNot only did Lyles call his shot and preemptively declare victory, he backed up his trash talk in the coolest way possible and won.

I'm the wolf among wolves,' says Lyles\n\nNoah Lyles has called for his own personalised trainer after winning the most dramatic Olympic 100m final in history - noting that not even the US track and field legend Michael Johnson had one made for him.\n\nThe American has long insisted that he wanted to be a global influencer by winning three gold medals in Paris, but after his victory over the Jamaican Kishane Thompson he upped his ambitions even further.\n\nLyles, who is the biggest star of the new Netflix Sprint documentary, said he deserved it after adding the Olympic title to his three world championship titles in Budapest last year.\n\n\"I want my own shoe - I want my own trainer,\" said Lyles, who is sponsored by Adidas. \"I am dead serious. There is no money in spikes. Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. For how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety that we get, the fact that hasn't happened is crazy.\"\n\nThe American rapper Snoop Dogg was among the fans inside the Stade de France and Lyles even challenged him to a race. \"I am going around as the Olympic champion - I have that title as the world's fastest man. This has been years in the making,\" he said.\n\nHowever afterwards, Lyles admitted that he had feared he had lost the race in a photo-finish. \"After the race, we were waiting for names to pop,\" he said. \"I am honest, I came over and told Kishane, 'I think you've got the Olympics, big dog.' He was in lane four. I was in lane seven. I couldn't really see what was happening.\n\n\"I was fully prepared to see his name pop up. To see mine, I was like: 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible.' This is the one I wanted. Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them. I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nLyles will be back on the track in the heats of the men's 200m on Monday and believes he will win gold and run a time that could challenge Usain Bolt's world record.\n\n\"I am pretty confident, I cannot lie,\" he said. \"Kenny Bednarek put out a fast time in the trials. That definitely woke me up. None of them are winning. When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.\"\n\nBut Fred Kerley, who won bronze and was seated next to Lyles in the press conference, rolled his eyes as Lyles spoke. \"You're talking shit, man,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_ingle@theguardian.com", "name": "Sean Ingle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0c7b92d8dad46eeaee626e4e3f01b7e7fa4d3ba/271_201_2841_1705/master/2841.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=cbfc5f681ec0b3057ec4f7c1556da5fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Cross the finish line as the eyelid closes, and you're a legend. Wait till the eyelid opens, and you're an afterthought. What a way to determine legacies.\n\nOn Sunday night, when eight sprinters crossed the finish line at Stade de France - all seemingly on that same down blink - legacies couldn't be determined by the naked eye. Chests heaving, nearly the entirety of the field looked at the scoreboard, yearning for answers. Aside seven of their names sat a single word in all caps: PHOTO.\n\nPoll the nearly 80,000 people who packed the place who won, and it might have been an even split. Cameras had to do the work. As the sprinters mingled to try to unfray their nerves, American Noah Lyles approached Jamaican Kishane Thompson.\n\n\"Bro,\" Lyles told Thompson. \"I think you got that one, big dog.\"\n\nThe first runner - it looked to be Thompson or Lyles, but who's to say? - crossed the line in 9.79 seconds. The last finished in 9.91. It took 28 seconds - nearly three times as long as the race - to show the result.\n\n\"I was not sure,\" Thompson said. \"It was that close.\"\n\nWhen the scoreboard finally revealed whose life would change irrecoverably, Lyles's name popped to the top. His time registered on the scoreboard as the same as Thompson's: 9.79 seconds. Digital photography determined the difference needed another decimal place: Lyles crossed in 9.784 seconds, Thompson in 9.789.\n\nDo the math. That's five thousandths of a second between gold and silver. American Fred Kerley crossed in 9.81 seconds. It was good only for bronze.\n\nWhatever the margin, there was the moment Lyles saw his name. He is full of brashness and bravado. The magnitude of the accomplishment was almost knee-buckling.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest: I wasn't ready to see it,\" Lyles said. \"And that's the first time I've ever said that in my head. Like, I wasn't ready to see it.\"\n\nNo matter that he had prepared for so many of his 27 years to see just that: gold medal, Olympic champion, world's fastest human. A dozen years ago as a teenager, he watched the London Olympics from his Alexandria, Va., home. He saw Jamaican icon Usain Bolt win gold in both the 100 and 200 meters. He boldly wanted - rather, he boldly decided - to do the same.\n\nThe Paris Olympics already had been thrilling. The final week began with an event that will be hard to dislodge from the best of the competition, a race that was nothing short of historic. The 100 always has been - and should always be - a marquee event at the Olympics. After something of a lull in recent years, Sunday night restored that status.\n\nWhat is a more basic judge of human athletic capability than who can cover a short distance in the least amount of time? Sprinting invites preening and showmanship, trash-talking and intimidation. The race lasts 10 seconds. The show is much longer.\n\nBolt, as much as any figure in history, leaned into it all, casting himself as a distinct character. He set the world record at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, all but prancing to the finish line, inviting the world to marvel at his superiority. He won again in London and four years later in Rio de Janeiro, too. He seemed untouchable - not just when he ran but for the sprinters chasing his ghost.\n\nSo in the years since Bolt's retirement in 2017, no one has stepped in - or, rather, no one has strutted forward - and seized the Alpha Male role on the men's side. Maybe that changed Sunday night, both because of how the race played out and who won it.\n\nPart of Lyles's initial reaction to winning gold by five-thousandths of a second was, \"Dang, I'm amazing.\" He meant it, and he was unafraid to say so. That's a champion sprinter playing the role.\n\nWhen the field was introduced for the evening's final event, each sprinter put his stamp on the moment. Thompson, whose 9.77-second victory at the Jamaican trials was the fastest time of the year, let out a roar from his thick, 6-foot-1 frame.\n\nBy comparison, that was mundane. Lyles, running from Lane 7, was introduced next-to-last. With a sunglass-wearing, leather-jacketed DJ thumping heavy bass lines through the stadium, Lyles bounded and leaped into the arena, bouncing almost 30 yards down the track.\n\nLyles had arrived. The show could start.\n\n\"Noah Lyles is Noah Lyles,\" said Lance Brauman, Lyles's longtime coach. \"He needs to do what he does. He's not your normal guy, so you can't treat him like a normal guy. You got to let him do the things he does to get excited.\"\n\nThompson, the betting favorite, ran from Lane 4, three spots to Lyles's left. But there was danger everywhere. Oblique Seville of Jamaica came out of the semifinals with a 9.81, the third-fastest time in the world this year - matching Lyles's personal best. Kerley lurked.\n\n\"We started the season, a lot of people were saying it's going to be a slow year in the 100,\" Lyles said. \"Well, it wasn't no slow year in the 100!\"\n\nWhen the gun went off, Lyles's reaction time matched the slowest in the field. But by midway through the race, he had reestablished himself.\n\n\"I was like, 'Okay, we're in the mix,'\" Brauman said. \"... At 80 [meters], I was like, 'Holy cow, he's right there.'\"\n\nImagine working day after day, week after week - over years - to have your fate determined by an amount of time and space that's not perceptible to the human eye. That was Noah Lyles - that was the entire 100-meter field - on Sunday night at the Paris Olympics. Consider this, too: Seville finished eighth in 9.91 seconds. Never had an entire field, unaided by wind, finished the 100 in less than 10 seconds.\n\n\"Beside Usain Bolt, nobody has run faster in an Olympic race than what they just did today,\" Baumann said. \"And that will go down as the closest final in the history of the Olympic Games. Put that into context. That means something to me.\"\n\nIt should mean something to every human who watched it. Boundaries are being pushed. Three years ago, Noah Lyles left Tokyo - an Olympics for which he did not qualify in the 100 - crushed by the fact he won only bronze in the 200.\n\nOn Sunday, his life changed because he was five-thousandths of a second faster than another man. He ripped off the bib bearing his name and held it to the crowd. LYLES, it blared.\n\n\"Here I am: First Olympics in the 100, now the Olympic champion,\" Lyles said. \"And you know, having that title not just at world championships but at the Olympics - of the world's fastest man.\"\n\nBy a mile or a millisecond, that's the title he earned. No one can take that from him. No one can take a remarkable night from anyone who saw it, 9.784 seconds that somehow could fill hours - rather, years - of conversation.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Lyles, whose final time was 9.83 seconds, was beaten out by Jamaica sprinter Oblique Seville by only 0.02 seconds.\n\nBut it was the interaction between the two athletes that caught fans' attention.\n\nDespite finishing second, when both sprinters ran across the finish line neck-and-neck, Lyles is seen staring down Seville for a few seconds.\n\nLyles may have thought he surpassed Seville at the end, which led to the taunt, but the final results indicate he did not. Lyles and Seville will have another shot at each other during the final.\n\nIn a previous race in June, there was a similar situation involving Lyles and Seville. In that instance, the Jamaican runner initiated a stare-down towards Lyles at the end of the race. Lyles sought to retaliate in the race on Sunday, but he did so in a losing fashion.\n\nThis year marks Lyles' second Olympic appearance. His sole medal win came in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics 200m race, where he won Silver. Lyles' (27) highest world ranking was first place for the 100m and 200m races.\n\nSeville (23) is also competing in his second Olympic games.

Lyles needed to record a new personal best and even then it nearly wasn't enough. He got off to a horror start - the slowest of the blocks in the eight-man final. A hundred meters of desperation later, he finished 5/1000 of a second in front of Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\n9.784 to 9.789.\n\nTickets to watch Sunday's evening session of the athletics competition at the Stade de France cost an eye-popping \u20ac980. If you were paying that kind of money, chances are you weren't doing it solely for the pleasure of watching the women's high jump, the men's hammer throw or the semifinals of the men's 1500m.\n\nNoah Lyles (extreme left) of USA won the men's 100m run in Paris Olympics. | Photo Credit: RITU RAJ KONWAR/The Hindu\n\nNoah Lyles (extreme left) of USA won the men's 100m run in Paris Olympics. | Photo Credit: RITU RAJ KONWAR/The Hindu\n\nRunning is perhaps the most basic athletic trait of man and the one that matters the most. Sure there are other running events but none are as raw as the 100m. It is the antithesis of complication. Eight men, their legs, and a straightforward test to see who can reach the end of a track in the fastest time. Who grew up wanting to be the world's best hammer thrower? Ethan Katzberg probably -- but not many others.\n\nYet, who didn't have dreams of being the fastest man in the world?\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd while most of us might have dreamt of it, only Noah Lyles gets to say he is. At least in the Olympic final. In his semifinal heat, he was beaten to the finish by Jamaica's Oblique Seville - adding more drama to an event that's not short of it.\n\nIt's unlikely if this is exactly what he had planned, but Lyles who's part of a Netflix series Sprint - that he hopes will do for track and field what Drive to Survive did for Formula 1 - is not particularly averse to drama. He's not short of hyperbole and self-promotion. At a press conference before the Games, Lyles declared himself the fastest man alive. \" It's me. It's always going to be me.\"\n\nFor all his bluster, the fact is that until he came to Paris, the 27-year-old didn't have the hardware to back himself up. He only had a bronze in the 200m at Tokyo. He might have three gold medals -- in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m -- at the World Championships last year but he's not the fastest this year - that is still Kishane Thompson.\n\nA surprise loss to the Jamaican Seville in the semifinals, the fact that he was even slower than Thompson, and the stage was set not for a crowning but a very public comeuppance. All his talk of being a star, of revolutionizing the sport had to start with a gold on the biggest stage on earth and that didn't seem like a guarantee. All the lights and cameras had to be followed by action.\n\nHaving talked the talk, Sunday at 9:50 PM in Paris, was his time to walk the walk - or at least sprint the sprint.\n\nTo Lyles' credit, he didn't betray any nerves as he took his place in the lineup in lane seven, just to the right of Seville. The man who had said he had the 'mindset of a god', now just mouthed the words 'thank you god'. To his right, Seville made finger guns and mock-fired down the track.\n\nThe drama was at a fever pitch by this point. The crowd that had been buzzing and anxious and making Mexican waves all evening became deathly quiet and the runners took their stances. There's really nothing like an Olympic sprint final - the looming, intimidating knowledge that it's over as suddenly as it starts, people working four years for under 10 seconds of performance.\n\nIn the next ten seconds, the stadium commentators squealed out as much as they could. The stadium itself was lit by tens of thousands of flashes as the finalists raced to the finish line. Lyles, dead last at first, pulled himself into contention before stretching his torso right at the finish line. For a few more seconds everyone looked on in disbelief at the giant screen, which showed a column of photo finishes, before declaring Lyles the winner.\n\nNoah Lyles of USA celebrates after winning the men's 100m. | Photo Credit: RITU RAJ KONWAR/The Hindu\n\nNoah Lyles of USA celebrates after winning the men's 100m. | Photo Credit: RITU RAJ KONWAR/The Hindu\n\nHe runs all the way around the ground, then onto the grass. It's less a lap of honour and more a release of emotion. The stadium celebrates with him. All eyes are on him as he asserts his right to take centre stage.\n\nLatest on SportstarNoah Lyles sprints the talk to 100m glory in Paris Olympics 2024 Jonathan SelvarajAthletics, Paris 2024

American Sprinter Dubbed As 'World's Fastest Man' After Winning Gold In Paris 2024 Olympics", "body": "Noah Lyles' time of 9.784 falls just short of Usain Bolt's record of 9.58 set in 2008.\n\nAmerican Sprinter Noah Lyles has grabbed the spotlight after clinching gold in the men's 100-meter event in the ongoing Paris 2024 Olympics. The 27-year-old, dubbed as now the fastest man on the planet, left behind Jamaica's Kishane Thompson at Stade de France to register a record time of 9.784, 0.005 seconds earlier. Hence, it's worth exploring the youngster's background.\n\nBorn on July 18th, 1997, Lyles' inspiration to become a sprinter arose from watching the 2012 Olympics in London. His father is Kevin Lyles, also a former American sprinter. The 27-year-old represented the United States in the 2014 Youth Olympic games and clinched gold and won several events over the years.\n\nLyles missed out on Rio Olympics qualification in 2016, but was a double gold medalist in the World U20 Championships. It was in 2017 during the USA Indoor Track and field championships that Lyles won his first senior title in the 300m race. He also won gold in the 2019 World Athletics championships in the 200m and 4x100 m race in Qatar.\n\nThe American sprinter hit a low from a personal standpoint in 2021 as he described his mental health struggles ahead of the 2021 Olympic games in Tokyo. Lyles still won bronze in the 200m heat in that edition, but had the chance to win gold if he hadn't slowed down in the semi-final.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 - or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, in lane seven, wins the men's 100-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters - his better race - and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles\u00b4 closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew - from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia\u00b4s Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport\u00b4s biggest prize of all - Olympic gold - to her world championship and world record.\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday\u00b4s semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport\u00b4s seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, celebrates as he wins the men's 100-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\"\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Tolan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Tolan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silvio Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allan Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/gfOP-t2OjmLVPQaDgI7fXJRyptg=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/ZFABRQN6DTHA666F2CUUSZUCKE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

This victory marks the first time an American has won the 100m Olympic gold since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe race was a spectacle, with only 0.03 seconds separating the podium finishers and a mere 0.12 seconds between the first and last place. Every competitor ran under 10 seconds, a feat never before achieved in Olympic history under legal wind conditions. Lyles, propelled by a 1.0 m/s tailwind, finished with a personal best of 9.79 seconds.\n\nHis triumph adds to his status as a world sprinting icon, following his successes at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, where he claimed gold in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay.\n\nThompson, who arrived at the Olympics as the fastest man of the year with a 9.77-second performance at the Jamaican trials, initially believed he had secured the gold. The race required a photo finish to determine the winner, revealing Lyles had edged out Thompson by the slimmest of margins.\n\nThompson completed the race with a time of 9.79 seconds, just behind Lyles. Despite his outstanding performance, Thompson had to settle for silver, a result he found bittersweet after having been the fastest qualifier in the semi-finals earlier that day.\n\nFred Kerley, the reigning world champion from Eugene 2022, took the bronze with a time of 9.81 seconds. South Africa's Akani Simbine finished fourth in 9.82 seconds, followed by the defending Olympic champion, Italy's Marcel Jacobs, who clocked 9.85 seconds despite suffering an injury that left him limping.\n\nThe race evoked memories of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where the top two finishers also recorded the same hundredth of a second, highlighting the razor-thin margins in elite sprinting.\n\nLyles' victory not only establishes him as the leading sprinter of the post-Usain Bolt era but also sets the stage for his attempt at a 100m and 200m double at these Games. He aims to challenge Bolt's world record in the 200m, with the final set to take place on Thursday, 8 August, at 2:30 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_assistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind assistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Noah11722818876-0/Noah11722818876-0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2363, "textEnd": 2371}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They were pretty much alone. The sun kept dropping, nearby horizons turning purple and orange and a darker yellow, a hue that looked a lot like ...\n\nGold.\n\nShe wasn't exactly nervous. And she wasn't exactly calm.\n\nHer son, Noah Lyles-the bombastic, shoe-painting, anime-watching, LEGO-building sprinter-needed to prove that embracing every single zany slice of his ever-more public personality had made him faster.\n\n\"I just want to get this going,\" she said, smiling, in a way that indicated she knew more than she wanted to say out loud.\n\nJust before Lyles left for Paris, other confidants weren't making any predictions, but one did tell Lyles one thing: He held the thumb and pointer finger on his right hand no more than half an inch apart. A sliver maybe. The end of a pen cap. A popsicle stick, laid flat. The 100-meter final, the confidant predicted, would be that close-specifically, the physical non-distance between first place and second.\n\nLyles, 27, nearly tied the 100-meter final on Sunday. He came as close as one can in his sport to running exactly the same time as another sprinter. Five-thousandths of a single second separated the gold and silver medal winners. That's 0.005 seconds. Google: what can happen in 0.005 seconds? The primary and prevalent answer is ... nothing. At least that can be perceived.\n\nIn winning the 100-meter dash, Lyles secured his first-but not likely his last-Olympic gold medal.\n\n\"It feels good,\" he said, \"to back it up.\"\n\nA lifetime unfolded between the walk onto the track and the photo finish. It began with an extraordinary Olympic prelude. The inside of the stadium all but pulsated. A deejay, clad in a black leather jacket, wearing sunglasses at night, spun deep house. As the bright stadium bulbs went completely dark, without warning, the lights along the upper ring flashed white and purple, in sync with the beats. The crowd gasped. Spotlights scanned from one side to the other, while tiny lights sparkled throughout the stands, thanks to wristbands fans were given at the gates. The thumping bass elevated, slowly at first, then faster, faster and faster, until the whole stadium felt like a bubble of anticipation about to pop.\n\nOne-by-one, the men's 100-meter finalists made their way onto the track. Here they were, in Paris, in an Olympic final, in their sport's premier race. Kishane Thompson, a Jamaican among the favorites, leaned back in the entrance tunnel, before slowly raising both arms, tilting his head back and roaring like a lion. The camera strung above the purple track dropped and elevated, slinging left and right, before settling on the obvious suspect: Lyles.\n\nHe didn't saunter onto the track. Nor did he swagger in. He ran. Not sprinting, but not slowly. He didn't stop at the starting blocks, like everybody else. He cruised about 15 meters beyond the others.\n\nLyles never stopped moving, like he had bottled every ounce of energy and online hatred and unrealized ambition but could no longer hold it in. His feet bounced on the purple track-purple, his favorite color-springing up, then down, as if guided by a trampoline underfoot.\n\nFred Kerley, another American finalist, entered the stadium right then. He held a finger to his lips, as if to say, quiet down. Perhaps that gesture was meant for Lyles, whose general nature had grated on his competition, especially over the last six months.\n\nLyles screamed. He beat his chest with both hands. Energy seemed to rise from his body, like steam rising from a whistling kettle. He saluted, then appeared to repeat the same three words, over and over. It looked like he was saying: thank you, God.\n\nThe crowd began to clap. The introductions dragged on for minutes that unspooled like hours. The competitors-the world's fastest men-stepped in place, swayed, danced, waiting for the signal. The last Olympic 100-meter champion, Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, stood still with his eyes closed.\n\nAt 9:53 p.m. local time, the sprinters leaned their bodies forward and placed their spikes into the starting blocks. The stadium dropped into near silence. The loudest sound came from the helicopters hanging overhead.\n\nAnticipation isn't the right word. The general feeling landed around start this damn thing already. The gun sounded. And off they went.\n\nFor the first few meters, Lyles sprinted from the back of the pack-perhaps, even, in last place. But that didn't last long. He caught them, all of them, these strong, powerful, human locomotives, each churning as fast as humanly possible toward the same line down the track.\n\nFor a second, it appeared that Kerley had won. Then it appeared that Lyles did. Then Thompson. Those three names flashed across the video screens, in that order. Everyone stood around the finish line.\n\nLyles approached Thompson at one point. \"Hey, man,\" Lyles told him, \"I think you got it.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for officials to come back with the results. Lyles surely must have never been happier to be dead wrong. Those same three names flashed on those same screens, only this time, in a different order: Lyles-Thompson-Kerley. The men's 100-meter final gold, silver and bronze medalists, respectively.\n\nIn the video analysis Olympic officials distributed after the race, Lyles was last, even at the 30-meter mark. He did not lead at any other point. In Lane 7, he didn't have time to look left, at Thompson in Lane 4, or Kerley in Lane 3. He told himself the obvious, in fractions of critical seconds. I need to lean. So that's what Lyles did. He leaned. They all did. Photographs from the finish line make the runners look like their necks are being bent forward by a gale-force wind.\n\nHis winning time, 9.79 seconds, matched Ben Johnson's steroid-aided world record in 1988, the one that didn't stand. Lyles began to alternately gallop and jog and walk around the track. He pumped his fists. He unleashed screams. He held his race bib, the one that read LYLES in black letters, and jumped a barrier to celebrate with Keisha and other relatives.\n\nLyles showed up as Noah on Sunday. Last month, Keisha said that the biggest difference she saw in her son from Tokyo-where he won bronze in the 200 meters-and Paris, was a fuller embrace of just how different he was. He came to a better understanding of self, which led him to a better understanding of his sport.\n\nBefore Paris, former sprinter Michael Johnson said that of all America's promising young superstars, Lyles had the best chance to vault to a new level of stardom with his results. \"But he has to do it in Paris, at the Olympics, and more than once,\" Johnson added.\n\nSunday marked an ideal start, for the six-time world champion and the now two-time Olympic medalist, who found himself and found his speed. Now, he can continue to chase one of his sport's rarest achievements in Paris. It's not a lock. But it's not that far away, either. Lyles didn't lose one 200-meter race over the 2022 and '23 seasons.\n\nBefore Sunday's final, Lyles wasn't nervous-same as Keisha on her walk. He thought back to a regular topic he had been exploring with his therapist. To not view pressure as a problem, to understand the notion that wanting something doesn't always equate to being able to automatically deliver it.\n\n\"I was extremely curious to see what was gonna happen,\" he said. \"I came in third fastest [in the semis.] This [was] not going to be easy. That's how we phrase it. I'm curious what I'm gonna do. How am I going to pull this off?\"\n\nHis therapist, Lyles said, told him to let go in those moments, to relax and be himself. Turns out, to achieve the rarest kind of greatness, and to lift his sport to the same heights he's headed toward, that was all he ever needed.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Please try again later.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- The 100 meters at the Olympics takes a blink. Cross the finish line as the eyelid closes, and you're a legend. Wait till the eyelid opens, and you're an afterthought. What a way to determine legacies.\n\nSunday night, when eight sprinters crossed the finish line at Stade de France -- all seemingly on that same down blink -- legacies couldn't be determined by the naked eye. Chests heaving, nearly the entirety of the field looked at the scoreboard, yearning for answers. Aside seven of their names sat a single word in allcaps: PHOTO.\n\nPoll the nearly 80,000 people who packed the place who won, and it might have been an even split. Cameras had to do the work. As the sprinters mingled to try to unfray their nerves, American Noah Lyles approached Jamaican Kishane Thompson.\n\n\"Bro,\" Lyles told Thompson. \"I think you got that one, big dog.\"\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nGet the latest updates on the 2024 Olympics\n\n(Washington Post illustration)\n\nTrack all the Paris Olympic medal counts country by country, and see the breakdown of medals by U.S. athletes. Get live updates from Paris and keep up with the latest by signing up for The Sports Moment: Olympics Edition.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe first runner -- it looked to be Thompson or Lyles, but who's to say? -- crossed the line in 9.79 seconds. The last finished in 9.91. It took 28 seconds -- nearly three times as long as the race -- to show the result.\n\n\"I was not sure,\" Thompson said. \"It was that close.\"\n\nWhen the scoreboard finally revealed whose life would change irrecoverably, Lyles's name popped to the top. His time registered on the scoreboard as the same as Thompson's: 9.79 seconds. Digital photography determined the difference needed another decimal place: Lyles crossed in 9.784 seconds, Thompson in 9.789.\n\nDo the math. That's five thousandths of a second between gold and silver. American Fred Kerley crossed in 9.81 seconds. It was good only for bronze.\n\nWhatever the margin, there was the moment Lyles saw his name. He is full of brashness and bravado. The magnitude of the accomplishment was almost knee-buckling.\n\n\"I'ma be honest: I wasn't ready to see it,\" Lyles said. \"And that's the first time I've ever said that in my head. Like, I wasn't ready to see it.\"\n\nNo matter that he had prepared for so many of his 27 years to see just that: gold medal, Olympic champion, world's fastest human. A dozen years ago as a teenager, he watched the London Olympics from his Alexandria, Va., home. He saw Jamaican icon Usain Bolt win gold in both the 100 and 200 meters. He boldly wanted -- rather, he boldly decided -- to do the same.\n\n\"It feels good to back it up,\" Lyles said.\n\nHold on. He's only halfway there. But what a half.\n\nThe Paris Olympics already had been thrilling. The final week began with an event that will be hard to dislodge from the best of the competition, a race that was nothing short of historic. The 100 always has been -- and should always be -- a marquee event at the Olympics. After something of a lull in recent years, Sunday night restored that status.\n\nWhat is a more basic judge of human athletic capability than who can cover a short distance in the least amount of time? Sprinting invites preening and showmanship, trash-talking and intimidation. The race lasts 10 seconds. The show is much longer.\n\nBolt, as much as any figure in history, leaned into it all, casting himself as a distinct character. He set the world record at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, all but prancing to the finish line, inviting the world to marvel at his superiority. He won again in London and four years later in Rio, too. He seemed untouchable -- not just when he ran, but for the sprinters chasing his ghost.\n\nSo in the years since Bolt's retirement in 2017, no one has stepped in -- or, rather, no one has strutted forward -- and seized the Alpha Male role on the men's side. Maybe that changed Sunday night, both because of how the race played out and who won it.\n\nPart of Lyles's initial reaction to winning gold by five-thousandths of a second was, \"Dang, I'm amazing.\" He meant it, and he was unafraid to say so. That's a champion sprinter playing the role.\n\nWhen the field was introduced for the evening's final event, each sprinter put his stamp on the moment. Thompson, whose 9.77-second victory at the Jamaican trials was the fastest time of the year, let out a roar from his thick, 6-foot-1 frame.\n\nBy comparison, that was mundane. Lyles, running from Lane 7, was introduced next-to-last. With a sunglass-wearing, leather-jacketed DJ thumping heavy bass lines through the stadium, Lyles bounded and leaped into the arena, bouncing almost 30 yards down the track.\n\nLyles had arrived. The show could start.\n\n\"Noah Lyles is Noah Lyles,\" said Lance Brauman, Lyles's longtime coach. \"He needs to do what he does. He's not your normal guy, so you can't treat him like a normal guy. You got to let him do the things he does to get excited.\"\n\nThompson, the betting favorite, ran from Lane 4, three spots to Lyles's left. But there was danger everywhere. Oblique Seville of Jamaica came out of the semifinals with a 9.81, the third-fastest time in the world this year -- matching Lyles's personal best. Kerley lurked.\n\n\"We started the season, a lot of people were saying it's going to be a slow year in the 100,\" Lyles said. \"Well, it wasn't no slow year in the 100!\"\n\nWhen the gun went off, Lyles's reaction time matched the slowest in the field. But 30 meters into the race, he had reestablished himself.\n\n\"I was like, 'Okay, we're in the mix,'\" Brauman said. \" ... At 80 [meters], I was like, 'Holy cow, he's right there.'\"\n\nImagine working day after day, week after week -- over years -- to have your fate determined by an amount of time and space that's not perceptible to the human eye. That was Noah Lyles -- that was the entire 100-meter field -- on Sunday night at the Paris Olympics. Consider this, too: Seville finished eighth in 9.91 seconds. Never had an entire field, unaided by wind, finished the 100 in less than 10 seconds.\n\n\"Beside Usain Bolt, nobody has run faster in an Olympic race than what they just did today,\" Baumann said. \"And that will go down as the closest final in the history of the Olympic Games. Put that into context. That means something to me.\"\n\nplayPlay now\n\nNaN min\n\nFollow on\n\nPodcast episode\n\nSpotify\n\nApple\n\nGoogle\n\nAmazon\n\nIt should mean something to every human who watched it. Boundaries are being pushed. Three years ago, Noah Lyles left Tokyo -- an Olympics for which he did not qualify in the 100 -- crushed by the fact he won only bronze in the 200.\n\nSunday, his life changed because he was five thousandths of a second faster than another man. He ripped off the bib bearing his name and held it to the crowd. LYLES, it blared.\n\n\"Here I am: First Olympics in the 100, now the Olympic champion,\" Lyles said. \"And you know, having that title not just at world championships, but at the Olympics -- of the world's fastest man.\"\n\nBy a mile or a millisecond, that's the title he earned. No one can take that from him. No one can take a remarkable night from anyone who saw it, 9.784 seconds that somehow could fill hours -- rather, years -- of conversation.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType":

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!' \"\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, celebrates as he wins the men's 100-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

Lyles is an American sprinter looking toward multiple events and medals at the Paris Olympics. Lyles, who specializes in the 100 and 200 meters, would like to compete in the two short sprints in addition to the 4x100 and 4x400 relays at the Paris Olympics. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Lyles won a bronze medal in the men's 200-meter. / Jasper Colt / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nNBA great Magic Johnson was among the first to congratulate sprinter Noah Lyles for winning the 100 meters at the Olympics Sunday.\n\nLyles became the first American to win the event since Justin Gatlin in 2004 in Athens. Lyles won a photo finish with a winning time of 9.79. He edged Kishane Thompson and Fred Kerley.\n\nJohnson, a Hall of Famer, wasted little time to celebrate the victory. He immediately took to social media.\n\nHere's what Johnson posted on X: \"We're all on the yacht cheering for Noah Lyles winning the Men's 100M race and remaining the fastest man in the world! It's the first time in 20 years that the US brings home the gold in the Men's 100! Wow - what an exciting race!!\"\n\nFormer Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade also joined the celebration. He used it as opportunity to silence those who criticize males for wearing nail polish. Wade is also part of the nail-painting fraternity.\n\n\"And he got his nails painted Say something,\" Wade wrote on X.\n\nLyles is now in the same class with Johnson and Wade.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

In fact, it might've been his skill set in the 200 that gave him just enough stamina to achieve gold in perhaps the closest 100m race ever.\n\nNo shade intended at the announcer given that Lyles only won by four thousandths of a second, but it was believed that Jamaica's Kishane Thompson was the winner at first glance.\n\nSHEESH that was close. Again, Lyles is more adept at the 200 meters, which obviously requires twice the distance to try to maintain top sprinting speed. To me, that accounts for how he was able to make a stunning surge to beat the competition in a true photo finish.\n\nLyles found a whole other gear in the final 15 meters or so before the finish line. Quite literally went from not making it to the podium to standing atop it with the gold medal. Unbelievable.\n\nA new World's Fastest Man from the great US of A. Hell yeah. Lyles is also the first American sprinter to win the Summer Olympics 100m dash since Justin Gatlin at the 2004 Athens Games. We've got some pretty special athletes from this great land who come in all shapes and sizes. Say what you will about golf, but Scottie Scheffler put up a 62 today to get the gold. Simone Biles might have two more gold medals to win at these Olympics in gymnastics, yet she's still not ruling out one more ride at the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd now Noah Lyles joins those names in immortality as a gold medalist in Paris. Looking forward to see if he can pull off the double in the 200m. The final for that race isn't until Thursday. Plenty of time for Lyles to rest up, recharge, and redeem himself for getting the 200m bronze as the Tokyo Olympics favorite in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/USA-3.jpg?fit=808%2C463&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles talked an awful lot of talk in the build-up to Paris 2024, but tonight he backed up the bluster with blistering speed on the Stade de France track, surging past the field to pip them all on the line. There can be no argument now. \"What's the title of Olympic champion?\" Lyles said, referring to \"the fastest man on the planet\" tag that goes with gold. \"Amen.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter that he didn't get near the world record he said he'd break, finishing in 9.79. It doesn't matter that the winning margin was only five thousandths of a second, a time too miniscule to comprehend. Jamaica's Kishane Thompson had been burdened with the title of heir to Usain Bolt after running the fastest time this year, and he led for 99m of this race. But Lyles is a fighter and he dug in, hauling himself alongside Thompson as they crossed the line.\n\nThompson roared in celebration but his face dropped when the giant screen displayed \"photo finish\" by his name. They stared up from purgatory, waiting for the verdict. Lyles paced with his hands on his head. Then it came, and Lyles was off again, one moment ripping the number from his chest and raising it to the gods, the next streaking across the hammer field with the stars and stripes flapping in the wind.\n\nThompson was awarded silver as Lyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze. Lyles admitted afterwards that he thought he was too late.\n\n\"I went to Kishane, I said, 'I'll be honest, I think you had that one'. I was prepared to see his name pop up. I saw my name pop up and I said, 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible'. It's the one I wanted. It's the hard battle, the amazing opponents, everybody was healthy and came to fight. I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nThompson hoped to be the first Jamaican man since Bolt to win a global 100m title.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" he said, \"I've just got to take it as it is and move forward from here.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and myself, I should have let my speed bring me to the line. I've learned from it. I couldn't see Noah, but I think he could see me and said, 'hey, Kishane, I thought you got it'. But I wasn't sure, he was too far to my right, so I wasn't sure.

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\"\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nBy the time Noah Lyles started the Olympic 100m final, he was already last. Lyles took 0.0178 sec to react to the gun and begin his race. That might sound quick but in a sport measured in thousandths of a second, he had just given up 0.07 to one his biggest rivals, fellow American Fred Kerley.\n\nThe man Lyles most feared, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, was just as sluggish, reacting in 0.0176. Yet Thompson is the fastest man this year for a reason. He is a 100m specialist with power and a long stride, and he emerged from his drive phase at 30m with the lead.\n\nBy contrast, and despite being the 100m world champion, Lyles is a 200m runner by trade. His strength is in his top speed but he takes a little while to get there, and his slow start has sometimes been an Achilles heel. At 30m he was dead last, eighth out of eight.\n\nCrucially, though, Lyles was now travelling towards the finish line quicker than anyone else. Between 50m and 60m he made a rapid, stunning climb from eighth to third as he reached his peak speed of the race, 43.6km/hr (27.1mph).\n\nAt this point, the leader Thompson (43.2km/hr) and second-place Kerley (43.1km/hr) had already hit their top speed and they were fighting to maintain it. Thompson, running in his first Olympic final, was clearly tensing up, grimacing and straining for the line.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me to the line in the position that I know I could have gone to,\" Thompson later admitted. \"But I have learned from it.\"\n\nThis is where Lyles came into his element. His speed endurance is his strength, which is why he is such a successful 200m sprinter. He is also an experienced campaigner, having run in Olympic and world finals with memories of both success and failure to call upon. Lyles stayed calm and composed, holding his smooth running style all the way to the line.\n\n\"To be honest, I was like, if I'm running 9.83 in the semi-finals I'm going to be hard to beat,\" he said. \"I called my therapist and she was like, 'you need to let go, you need to let it flow', I was like, 'alright, I'm going to trust you'.\"\n\nHe still had one last job to do. The photo finish shows how Lyles body is leaning forwards, head dragging the torso through the line with the legs trailing behind. If Lyles' lean is around 60 degrees from the track, Thompson's is more like 75.\n\nTechnically, Thompson's right hallux was the first body part to complete this Olympic final. But finish lines only recognise the chest. Lyles won gold by five thousandths of a second, quicker than the time it takes to blink.\n\n\"I did think [Thompson] had it at the end,\" Lyles admitted. \"I went up to him while we were waiting, and said \"I think you've got that, good going', and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\"\n\nHe had overcome not only seven rival finalists but the weight of American expectation, delivering Olympic men's 100m gold for the first time in 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in Athens.\n\n\"I had so many commercials going around and so many people, like Snoop Dog is out here, saying that I'm going to be the one. I'm not going to say it's not pressure, it's definitely pressure. Saying that the moment is not bigger than me, that the moment was meant for me, constantly saying that it's going to be the thing I need.\"\n\nIt was a moment that encapsulated Lyles: drama, entertainment, sheer theatre. Michael Johnson called it the greatest 100m final he had ever seen. \"We had this amazing race where you could throw a blanket over the finishing line,\" said the American sprint legend. \"We didn't even know who won for a few minutes.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achilles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Endurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/05/11/2165280113.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

On a warm Sunday evening in Saint-Denis, Lyles edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by a mere five-thousandths of a second in the men's 100-meter final, a victory that underscored the razor-thin line between glory and second place.\n\nThe race, which concluded in a photo finish, saw Lyles clock a personal best of 9.784 seconds, just fractionally ahead of Thompson's 9.789 seconds. This marked the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 meters since electronic timing was introduced, and possibly the closest ever in Olympic history.\n\nAs the athletes crossed the finish line, the scoreboard hesitated, displaying \"Photo\" next to the names of the contenders. The tension was palpable as both sprinters and the crowd awaited the verdict. Lyles, who had been visibly anxious, finally saw his name flash as the winner, prompting him to tear off his name tag and brandish it towards the sky in triumph.\n\nThis victory is not just about the gold medal for Lyles but represents a pivotal moment in his career. After settling for bronze in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Games, a result that left him profoundly dissatisfied, Lyles redirected his focus towards the 100 meters. His dedication to improving every facet of his sprinting, from starts to mental fortitude, paid significant dividends in Paris.\n\nLyles' win also marks a historical milestone, making him the first American to clinch the marquee sprint title at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004. His achievement has reignited excitement around track and field in the U.S., reminiscent of the era dominated by legends like Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses.\n\nThe race itself was a masterpiece of competitive sprinting, with the first four finishers separated by less than 0.03 seconds, and the top seven within 0.09 seconds. America's Fred Kerley, who came in third with a time of 9.81 seconds, described it as \"probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in.\"\n\nAside from the sheer competitive nature of the race, the psychological warfare was equally gripping. Thompson, known for his explosive starts, let out a primal scream during the introductions, a tactic often employed by Lyles in major races. This psychological interplay added another layer of drama to the proceedings, with Lyles momentarily thrown but quickly regaining his composure.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_automatic_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fully automatic time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Moses", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edwin Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05082245/Noah-Lyles-508.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It was a look of complete and utter confidence.\n\nOf course, as things played out, Noah Lyles would get his revenge on Seville. Seville actually finished in last in the 100-meter dash final in Paris, clocking a 9.91 -- still an absurdly fast time, of course.\n\nInstead, it was a different Jamaican that Lyles edged out for the win by five-thousandths of a second: Kishane Thompson. Lyles clocked a 9.784 for the win, his fastest time yet. Just as promised.\n\nHe had given warning, after all.\n\n\"I feel great. I feel ready to run,\" Noah Lyles said after Seville beat him out in early June. \"I feel ready for everything that's moving on from here. Ready to go to the Olympic trials. All my best races happen after the second round. But 85, I'm never going to be upset with that. My coach came here saying that I'm in PR shape, running 9.85. I'm perfectly fine with that.\"\n\nIf he was fine with that, he'll have to be thrilled with a 79. Oh yeah, and an Olympic gold medal ... and the title of The World's Fastest Man.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_goldkamp@on3.com", "name": "Thomas Goldkamp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/08/04170600/LylesNoah_240804_001_LeeKirby_USAT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-02", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 113}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

'I want my own trainer. That's serious. I want a sneaker.\n\n'There ain't no money in spikes, there's money in sneakers. Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker.\n\n'For how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety were get, the fact that hasn't happened, that's crazy to me. That needs to happen.'\n\nLyles ran a personal best of 9.79sec to land his first Olympic gold medal. But he was only declared the winner following a photo finish, admitting he thought Thompson had beaten him.\n\n'After the race when we were waiting for the names to come up, I came over and said to Kishane, 'I think you've got that one big dog',' said Lyles.\n\n'When my name popped up, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I am amazing'. I wasn't ready to see my name.'\n\nLyles now believes he will back up his 100m title with victories in the 200m and 4x100m relay, just like he did at the World Championships.\n\n'I'm pretty confident, I can't lie,' he said. 'I'll be winning. When they come off the turn, they will be depressed.\n\n'The 200m is my better event and now I got a PB in the 100m, I'm ready to take it to the 200m.'\n\nLyles' victory made amends for his disappointing Olympics in Tokyo in 2021, when he finished third in the 200m, having failed to make the US team in the 100m.\n\nAsked when he was first motivated to win gold in Paris, Lyles pulled out his bronze medal from Tokyo and said: 'I was fuelled as soon as I saw this is in my hand. The journey started after 2021 when I got the bronze medal and I said, 'I have to change'.\n\n'Now I am going around as the Olympic champion. I have that title as the world's fastest man.

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\"\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had [him] cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen Is a Go for Heated Men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The U.S. track & field athlete, who secured a bronze last Olympics in the 200m, won gold in the 100m on Sunday in Paris. He set a personal best of 9.79, beating the silver medalist Kishane Thompson by just five thousandths of a second. His teammate, Fred Kerley, secured bronze with a 9.81.\n\nLyles overcame a subpar reaction time, the worst of the field (0.178). There was an extended pre-race portion as it is one of the most anticipated events of the Games. Lyles appeared to be motioning for the theatrics to speed up before the athletes took their marks.\n\nHis personal best in the event before the final was a 9.81, which he posted at the London Athletics Meet in July. At team trials, he posted a 9.83 before the Olympics in late June.\n\nLyles ran a 10.04 in his quarterfinal heat, sandwiched between Louie Hinchliffe (Great Britain) who put up a 9.98 and Shaun Maswanganyi (South Africa) who put up a 10.06. He admitted after that heat that he was a little stunned by how much his fellow competitors brought their A-game.\n\n\"That's my first lesson in underestimating the power of the Olympics. When somebody's on the line, they're going to give it their all or nothing. But now I don't have to hold back. I'm ready to go.\"\n\nIn his semifinal heat, Lyles secured one of the two automatic-in slots in his heat with a 9.83, second in his heat to Oblique Seville (Jamaica), who put up a 9.81. Of the eight runners that qualified, two (Seville and Kishane Thompson, also of Jamaica) put up better quarterfinal times than him.\n\nLyles is not done at the Paris games.

The former recorded a time of 9.81, which matched Lyles' all-time personal best.\n\nSeville beat Lyles by 0.02 seconds, but both still men qualified for a spot in the 100m final. British sprinter Louie Hinchliffe, who bested Lyles in Round 1 of the men's 100m, finished third and missed the cutoff.\n\nPhotos of the thrilling finish showed Lyles staring down Seville as both men crossed the finish line. The moment has since turned Lyles into a trending topic.\n\nThe Lyles-Seville beef isn't completely fresh. Fans have unearthed Lyles' warning against Seville from just weeks ago.\n\nIn June, Seville also bested Lyles during the 100m in the Racers Grand Prix held in Kingston, Jamaica. The hometown sprinter had stared down Lyles at the finish line as they crossed the finish line.\n\nThe U.S. star later posted the photo and issued a warning against Seville that doesn't exactly look flattering moments after the semifinal happened.\n\n\"Oh yah... I'll remember this! See you in Paris,\" Lyles captioned the post while tagging Seville.\n\nLyles may have been trying to recreate the moment against Seville on the Olympic stage but again ended up behind the Jamaican.\n\nAfter placing second to Hinchliffe in the 1st round earlier this week, Lyles issued a similar warning to the rest of the field.\n\nBut Lyles ultimately got the last laugh. The U.S. sprinter bounced back with a blazing 9.79 finish in the final to win the Olympic gold medal. Seville finished last with a 9.91 showing.\n\nRelated: Noah Lyles Fires Stern Warning After Brutal Paris Olympics Debut", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_p_salao@postandcourier.com", "name": "R.P.

Mandatory Credit: Yukihito Taguchi-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNoah Lyles finally reached the summit he missed in Tokyo, winning the men's 100m Olympic gold medal. In a stacked field, the American sprinter took home the win in a photo finish with Kishane Thompson.\n\nSpeaking at the post-event press conference, the 27-year-old looked ahead at his possible future and shared his goals. Wanting to join the list of some of the most elite athletes across the globe and in history, Lyles has his eyes on launching his own sneakers.\n\nHe explained that the spiked shoes that runners wear, were of no interest to him, as there wasn't much money in them. Thus, his focus remained on sneakers.\n\n\"I want my own shoe....I want a sneaker, there ain't no money in spikes.\"\n\nReferring to the great Michael Johnson, Lyles claimed how he \"didn't have his own sneaker\"- such has been the history of American sprinters. Talking about the number of medals they bring in from various competitions, Lyles felt the American sprinters go unnoticed in terms of their brand image.\n\nThus, the Gainesville native hopes to become the first American sprinter to have a sneaker named after him. And given his latest accomplishment, he has good reason. Noah Lyles's journey to the Olympics, however, has not been without its challenges.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics in 2021 ended in heartbreak for the 27-year-old as he had to settle for bronze. Ever since then, only one goal stood in front of his eyes, and that was to become the Olympic champion. But a 6-foot hurdle by the name of Kishane Thompson stood in the way.\n\nIn the build-up for the Paris Olympics, Thompson was the fastest man of 2024 and was the favorite to win the gold. But Lyles was having none of it. Showing shaky form in the heats and the semi-finals, the 27-year-old gathered himself when it mattered most.\n\nRunning neck and neck, both Lyles and Thompson crossed the finish line at exactly 9.79 seconds. But Lyles was five-thousandths of a second faster, which helped him become the first American 100m champion in the 100m event, in over two decades.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_gopal_srivastava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Naman Gopal Srivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/86d3eeb9-noah-lyles-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Lyles became the initial American, man or woman, to capture the title since Justin Gatlin emerged victorious in the 2004 Athens Games. In a close finish, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson secured the silver medal, just five-thousandths of a second behind Lyles. Lyles' US compatriot Fred Kerley claimed the bronze in 9.81 seconds, narrowly edging out South African Akani Simbine, who clocked in at 9.82 seconds. Defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy finished fifth in 9.85 seconds, while Botswana's Letsile Tebogo came in sixth with a time of 9.86 seconds. American Kenny Bednarek finished seventh in 9.88 seconds, with Jamaican Oblique Seville rounding out the race in eighth place with a time of 9.91 seconds.\n\nCommencing in lane seven, on the outside of Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles started off with an average beginning but quickly found his rhythm.\n\nWith his head down through the first 40 meters, the American sprinter then accelerated, with the entire field pushing him to the limit.\n\nAs Lyles crossed the finish line with Thompson hot on his heels, the crowd erupted and a close finish was declared before Lyles was officially declared the gold medalist.\n\nThe pre-race atmosphere was electric in the 69,000-seat Stade de France, with a dazzling light show and pulsating bass-heavy music keeping the spectators entertained as the sprinters made their final preparations at the starting blocks.\n\nAfter the lights were dimmed, the sprinters left the track to re-enter like gladiators in a colosseum.\n\nIntroduced individually over the speakers, each sprinter was presented with an image of their name alongside their country's flag.\n\nThompson let out a roar, clenching his fists as he threw his head back. Kerley tapped his chest.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 meters down the track. Jacobs remained composed, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nAnd then came the moment where the sprinters settled, ready at the starter's command.\n\nThe wait felt endless. The music played on, the crowd clapped in unison as if urging the starter to begin, and the sprinters stood in their lanes, shifting their weight from foot to foot, the tension palpable.\n\nThe cameras scanned the field once more, and then it was time, with the only sound being the whirring of a helicopter's blades overhead.\n\nThe signal was given and the competitors surged forward as one on the purple track.\n\nThe officials at the photo-finish examined the evidence, and Lyles walked away with the gold medal, putting to rest the disappointments of the Tokyo Games where he had only managed to secure a bronze in the 200m event.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I'm incredible.\"\n\nLyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81sec, just one-hundredth ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who timed 9.82sec.\n\nIn an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85sec, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86sec, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88sec and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91sec.\n\nStarting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern.\n\nHead tucked down through to the 40-metre mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way.\n\nAs Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters made the final adjustments to their starting blocks.\n\nTense buildup\n\nThe lights were then shut off, the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum.\n\nEach sprinter was individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.\n\nAsked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt.\n\n\"100 percent,\" he said. \"That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to take it to the 200.\"", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki",

He's going to say 'I'm going after it in the 200m' because he knows he can go after it.\"\n\nBut Lyles had a message for any pretenders to the crown in the 200m, an event in which he is reigning three-time world champion.\n\n\"I'll be winning!\" he said. \"None of them is winning. When I come off the turn, They will be depressed.\"\n\nLyles' winning time in the 100m was a personal best, but he'd known something was cooking after timing 9.83 sec in the semi-finals.\n\n\"When I saw that, I know I'm going to be difficult to beat, I'm about to set a personal record,\" he said.\n\n\"I called my therapist and she was like, 'you need to let go, you need to let it flow', and I was like, 'alright I'm going to trust you'.\"\n\nMental health\n\nThe therapy certainly worked and set Lyles up perfectly for a tilt at a treble, with the 4x100m relay to follow the 200m, round one of which is on Monday.\n\nLyles came away from the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games with just a bronze in the 200m, something he said left him with burning in his chest.\n\nBut he was adamant that he had changed in the three years since then.\n\n\"Oh gosh, this is definitely a different Noah, 100 per cent,\" said Lyles, who has openly talked about his struggles with mental health and depression in recent years.\n\n\"I'm definitely not depressed. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely feeling normal stress. I definitely feel the moment. It's a lot to deal with.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds.

And even with the photo it's somewhat hard to determine the winner at the finish.\n\nCheck out how close it was below.\n\nThe finish was so close that Lyles and Thompson spent an agonizingly long few seconds simply looking up at the scoreboard with their hands on their head after the race, waiting for the winner to be announced.\n\nWhen Lyles learned he had won, he reacted jubilantly, bouncing up and down the track, taking his pinned USA label from the front of his jersey and holding it up to the crowd.

They were pretty much alone. The sun kept dropping, nearby horizons turning purple and orange and a darker yellow, a hue that looked a lot like ...\n\nGold.\n\nShe wasn't exactly nervous. And she wasn't exactly calm.\n\nHer son, Noah Lyles -- the bombastic, shoe-painting, anime-watching, LEGO-building sprinter -- needed to prove that embracing every single zany slice of his ever-more public personality had made him faster.\n\n\"I just want to get this going,\" she said, smiling, in a way that indicated she knew more than she wanted to say out loud.\n\nJust before he left for Paris, Lyles's biomechanist Ralph Mann told him one thing: He held the thumb and pointer finger on his right hand no more than half an inch apart. A sliver maybe. The end of a pen cap. A popsicle stick, laid flat. The 100-meter final, Mann predicted, would be that close -- specifically, the physical non-distance between first place and second.\n\nLyles, 27, nearly tied the 100-meter final on Sunday. He came as close as one can in his sport to running exactly the same time as another sprinter. Five-thousandths of a single second separated the gold and silver medal winners. That's 0.005 seconds. Google: what can happen in 0.005 seconds? The primary and prevalent answer is ... nothing. At least that can be perceived.\n\nIn winning the 100-meter dash, Lyles secured his first -- but not likely his last -- Olympic gold medal.\n\n\"It feels good,\" he said, \"to back it up.\"\n\nA lifetime unfolded between the walk onto the track and the photo finish. It began with an extraordinary Olympic prelude. The inside of the stadium all but pulsated. A deejay, clad in a black leather jacket, wearing sunglasses at night, spun deep house. As the bright stadium bulbs went completely dark, without warning, the lights along the upper ring flashed white and purple, in sync with the beats. The crowd gasped. Spotlights scanned from one side to the other, while tiny lights sparkled throughout the stands, thanks to wristbands fans were given at the gates. The thumping bass elevated, slowly at first, then faster, faster and faster, until the whole stadium felt like a bubble of anticipation about to pop.\n\nOne-by-one, the men's 100-meter finalists made their way onto the track. Here they were, in Paris, in an Olympic final, in their sport's premier race. Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, a favorite with the world's fastest time this year, leaned back in the entrance tunnel, before slowly raising both arms, tilting his head back and roaring like a lion. The camera strung above the purple track dropped and elevated, slinging left and right, before settling on the obvious suspect: Lyles.\n\nHe didn't saunter onto the track. Nor did he swagger in. He ran. Not sprinting, but not slowly. He didn't stop at the starting blocks, like everybody else. He cruised about 15 meters beyond the others.\n\nLyles never stopped moving, like he had bottled every ounce of energy and online hatred and unrealized ambition but could no longer hold it in. His feet bounced on the purple track -- purple, his favorite color -- springing up, then down, as if guided by a trampoline underfoot.\n\nFred Kerley, another American finalist, entered the stadium right then. He held a finger to his lips, as if to say, quiet down. Perhaps that gesture was meant for Lyles, whose general nature had grated on his competition, especially over the last six months.\n\nLyles screamed. He beat his chest with both hands. Energy seemed to rise from his body, like steam rising from a whistling kettle. He saluted, then appeared to repeat the same three words, over and over. It looked like he was saying: thank you, God.\n\nThe crowd began to clap. The introductions dragged on for minutes that unspooled like hours. The competitors -- the world's fastest men -- stepped in place, swayed, danced, waiting for the signal. The defending Olympic 100-meter champion, Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, stood still with his eyes closed.\n\nAt 9:53 p.m. local time, the sprinters leaned their bodies forward and placed their spikes into the starting blocks. The stadium dropped into near silence. The loudest sound came from the helicopters hanging overhead.\n\nAnticipation isn't the right word. The general feeling landed around start this damn thing already. The gun sounded. And off they went.\n\nFor the first few meters, Lyles sprinted from the back of the pack -- perhaps, even, in last place. But that didn't last long. He caught them, all of them, these strong, powerful, human locomotives, each churning as fast as humanly possible toward the same line down the track.\n\nFor a second, it appeared that Kerley had won. Then it appeared that Lyles did. Then Thompson. Those three names flashed across the video screens, in that order. Everyone stood around the finish line.\n\nLyles approached Thompson at one point. \"Hey, man,\" Lyles told him, \"I think you got it.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for officials to come back with the results. Lyles surely must have never been happier to be dead wrong. Those same three names flashed on those same screens, only this time, in a different order: Lyles-Thompson-Kerley. The men's 100-meter final gold, silver and bronze medalists, respectively.\n\nIn the video analysis Olympic officials distributed after the race, Lyles was last, even at the 30-meter mark. He did not lead at any other point. In Lane 7, he didn't have time to look left, at Thompson in Lane 4, or Kerley in Lane 3. He told himself the obvious, in fractions of critical seconds. I need to lean. So that's what Lyles did. He leaned. They all did. Photographs from the finish line make the runners look like their necks are being bent forward by a gale-force wind.\n\nHis winning time, 9.79 seconds, matched Ben Johnson's steroid-aided world record in 1988, the one that didn't stand. He is the first male U.S. sprinter to win the race since Justin Gatlin in 2004. Lyles began to alternately gallop and jog and walk around the track. He pumped his fists. He unleashed screams. He held his race bib, the one that read LYLES in black letters, and jumped a barrier to celebrate with Keisha and other relatives.\n\nLyles showed up as Noah on Sunday. Last month, Keisha said that the biggest difference she saw in her son from Tokyo -- where he won bronze in the 200 meters -- and Paris, was a fuller embrace of just how different he was. He came to a better understanding of self, which led him to a better understanding of his sport.\n\nBefore Paris, former sprinter Michael Johnson said that of all America's promising young superstars, Lyles had the best chance to vault to a new level of stardom with his results. \"But he has to do it in Paris, at the Olympics, and more than once,\" Johnson added.\n\nSunday marked an ideal start, for the six-time world champion and the now two-time Olympic medalist, who found himself and found his speed. Now, he can continue to chase one of his sport's rarest achievements in Paris -- the sprint double. It's not a lock. But it's not that far away, either. Lyles didn't lose one 200-meter race over the 2022 and '23 seasons.\n\nBefore Sunday's final, Lyles wasn't nervous -- same as Keisha on her walk. He thought back to a regular topic he had been exploring with his therapist. To not view pressure as a problem, to understand the notion that wanting something doesn't always equate to being able to automatically deliver it.\n\n\"I was extremely curious to see what was gonna happen,\" he said. \"I came in third fastest [in the semis.] This [was] not going to be easy. That's how we phrase it. I'm curious what I'm gonna do. How am I going to pull this off?\"\n\nHis therapist, Lyles said, told him to let go in those moments, to relax and be himself. Turns out, to achieve the rarest kind of greatness, and to lift his sport to the same heights he's headed toward, that was all he ever needed.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news",

I'm going to handle this correctly and practice over the years'. It's accumulated to this point. You only need one. As long as that's the last one, that's all that matters,\" he said.\n\nThe gold made Lyles the first American, male or female, to win the event since Justin Gatlin claimed the gold in 2004, while luckless Kishane Thompson of Jamaica, who had appeared slightly ahead of Lyles at the race's halfway point, took silver with 0.005 seconds behind.\n\n\"It's been a rollercoaster, ups and downs. I'm usually a guy who likes to come out blazing in all my rounds, especially in the 200m. But the 100m, it's my first time here on the Olympic stage,\" Lyles noted.\n\nThompson said he was super grateful and he came out here and finished injury free, \"I think you guys know my past issues with injuries, so I am a bit disappointed. But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learnt from it,\" Thompson added.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

This was his first-ever gold medal in the Summer Games after winning bronze in the 200m event in the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nLyles' outing nearly ended in disaster, though, after the enigmatic track star lost out in the preliminary race earlier in the day to long-time rival Oblique Seville of Jamaica. Lyles ended up losing the semifinal after staring down Seville right before they crossed the finish line.\n\nLyles' showboating got the better of him in the preliminary race as he ended up finishing second behind Seville. Lyles clocked in with a final time of 9.83, which was just 0.02 seconds behind Seville's time.\n\nLyles himself admitted that he committed a near-fatal error in the preliminary race -- one that he vowed to learn from.\n\n\"These are like the hardest fought medals I've ever had to do,\" Lyles said after winning gold in the final race. \"I came out here in the first round and I underestimated it. And I said, never again.\n\n\"I'm gonna come out here with the intention to win every round. Even though I didn't get the win in the semis, all that matters is the last one.\"\n\nLyles lived up to his promise later in the day as he finished with a time of 9.784 seconds -- a personal best -- in the final to bag the gold.\n\nFor what it's worth, Lyles defeated second-place finisher Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by just 0.005 seconds. The American made sure not to taunt his opponent in this one.\n\nRelated: Simone Biles Reveals Her Ultimate Goal After Olympics\n\nRelated: Fans In Disbelief Over Slow-Mo Video Of Simone Biles' Historic Vault\n\nRelated: Suni Lee Drops Honest Admission About Simone Biles Clash", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paolo_songco@postandcourier.com", "name": "Paolo Songco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It was a phenomenally tight race, with just 0.12 seconds between winner Lyles and Oblique Seville in eighth.\n\nThe winner posted a personal best of 9.79, following through on the confidence he showed before the race. When he crossed the line, though, the result was far from certain.\n\nThompson and Lyles were pictured together out on the track while waiting for the result to come in. Now, the American has shared the details of that conversation.\n\n\"After I passed [Seville] I saw Kishane out there I was like just do what I do, hit my top-end speed, let it work,\" Lyles told SportsMax TV (via Metro) \"To be honest, I didn't know if I had it. I leaned but I didn't know I had it.\n\n\"Me and Kishane were at the end waiting for our names to come up and I came back and I said, 'I'll be honest, man, I think you got that one'. But my name came up and I was like, 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\n\n\"I've waited a long time, I've seen Jamaicans dominate the 100m and 200m for so long and I remember growing up saying, 'when it's my turn I'm going to make sure that the US is on top'. And here it is, here's my time, my journey, my moment, it's such a beautiful thing to see.\"\n\nHow many more medals will Noah Lyles win in Paris? Have your say in the comments section\n\nLyles wasn't at his best in the lead-up to the final. He could only finish second behind Team GB's Louie Hinchliffe in his heat, and came in behind Seville in his semi.\n\nThe 27-year-old want to add even more medals before the games conclude. He has the world-leading time this year over 200 metres, with the heats in that event beginning on Monday night\n\nLyles can also emulate the great Usain Bolt and complete a treble if he wins the 200m and also takes gold in the 4x100m relay. He was part of the 4x100 relay team which posted 2024's world leading time, alongside Courtney Lindsey, Kenny Bednarek and Kyree King.\n\n\"I have a biomechanist who comes down and before I came out here, he said it's going to be this much, that's how much you've got to win by because that's how close it is going to be\" Lyles told the BBC, pinching his fingers together. \"And gosh was he right.\"\n\nFollow all the action from day 10 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Lyles' win was the closest on record, as he beat his nearest competitor (Jamaica's Kishane Thompson) by five-thousandths of a second (.005). The most recent comparable race to this year's photo-finish came in Moscow 1980, well before times were recorded to such a granular level. Great Britain's Allan Wells and Cuba's Silvio Sarria both notched a time of 10.25 seconds, with Wells taking the gold.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles shared with reporters, about the close finish. \"I went up to him when we were waiting and I said, 'I think you got that one, big dog.' And then my name popped up and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\n\nLyles' win is the first time an American has taken the top prize in the race in 20 years, with the years between Justin Gatlin's 2004 Athens win and the present filled by the indomitable run of Jamaica's Usain Bolt. It's that retired superstar who the press-savvy Lyles sees as his biggest competition, as he's frequently boasted that his goal is to top the string of records set by the world's fastest man.\n\nBoth Bolt's Olympic and world records in the 100m were safe on Sunday. Bolt set his Olympic record in 2012 with a time of 9.63, more than a tenth of a second faster than Lyles' winning time of 9.79 (his personal best). Bolt's world record is even more distant, a staggeringly fast sprint of 9.58 seconds that he set in 2009.\n\nLyles specializes in the 200m race, which is still to come on Tuesday. Bolt also holds the record for that competition. A gold in Lyles' preferred event would make him the first man to take both medals since Bolt in 2016.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Third Lulu's Car Wash opens in Aiken Traffic delays anticipated as resurfacing begins on Aiken's Whiskey Road One person dead following fatal hit-and-run in Barnwell County Aiken-trained Post Time runs third in Whitney Stakes ARTS AND HUMANITIES: A lost Carolina novel is found New facility for Children's Place almost complete SC's Tax Free Weekend begins today.

Corey Murphy shares insights with community leaders\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line. He and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point.\n\nBut this would take more than 10 seconds to decide. When Lyles learned he'd won it, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man.

When I crossed the line, I went up to him and said, 'Hey, man, I think you got that one'.\n\n\"When it came out, I thought, 'Oh my gosh, I am amazing'.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old beat out rival Jamaican Kishane Thompson (9.789) and fellow American Fred Kerley (9.81).\n\nThe race was the first time in Olympic history all 100m runners had qualified for the final in under 10 seconds.\n\nLyles' path to victory had been anything but easy as the Florida-born sprinter bypassed the traditional US college athlete route to turn professional.\n\nThe American had spent the leadup to the Olympics working on his technique and practicing his infamously poor start with coach Lance Brauman.\n\nWhen the starting gun fired, his 0.178 reaction time set him off the blocks in last place as he torched his way down the straight.\n\nHis speed saved him as he gradually fought his way back among the pack by 50m and threw himself over the line to overtake Thompson by a hair's breadth.\n\nWhile Thompson actually broke the line first with his foot, it was the American whose chest first passed the finishing line - the body part which determines the victor.\n\nThe victory makes Lyles the first United States Olympic champion in 20 years - since Justin Gatlin won at Athens in 2004.\n\nLyles has set himself the goal of winning gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay after achieving the trifecta at the World Championship in Budapest.\n\nThe outspoken sprinter will now turn his focus onto the 200m sprint event which will begin on Monday before the final on Thursday (local time).", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/90aad9f45e6e56a8198cd21844bd767a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Message After Gold-Medal Win News", "body": "Noah Lyles, the 27-year-old sprinter, made history by becoming the first American to win gold in the men's 100-meter since 2004. In a nail-biting photo finish victory, Lyles won by five-thousandths of a second, securing his first Olympic gold medal. Known for his vibrant personality and emotional nature, Lyles has always been one to back up his words with actions. Prior to the opening ceremony, he boldly wrote \"ICON\" on his nails, setting the stage for his remarkable performance.\n\nDespite his outward confidence, Lyles has faced his fair share of struggles, including asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and depression. In a powerful message of inspiration, he shared on social media, \"What you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\" This message resonates with anyone facing challenges and serves as a reminder of the power of perseverance and determination.\n\nClocking in at 9.79784 seconds, Lyles set a personal best with his gold-winning sprint. Even with the slowest reaction time and initially being in last place at the 40-meter mark, he defied the odds to claim victory. His triumphant performance added to the impressive tally of five gold medals won by Americans on that memorable day.\n\nLooking ahead, Lyles is setting his sights on the 200-meter race, with a dream goal of breaking Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19 seconds. Track legend Carl Lewis emphasized the importance of Lyles' success for the sport, stating that track and field thrive when there is a dominant champion to rally behind. With Lyles' potential to elevate the sport and capture the hearts of fans worldwide, his journey is one to watch and support.\n\nAs fans eagerly anticipate Lyles' future races and achievements, his story serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration for all. In a world where adversity is common, his words \"Why Not You!\" echo as a reminder to dream big, work hard, and never let obstacles define your potential. Noah Lyles' gold medal victory is not just a triumph on the track but a testament to the power of perseverance and self-belief.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/news-05082024-060626.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

While Thompson's foot appears to have crossed the line first, it is the torso - which includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis and back, that is primarily measured for the 100m.\n\nOfficials at the games are believed to use a \"slit video\" system that scans the finish line 2,000 times per second, showing an accurate image of when each athlete crossed the line.\n\nPhoto finishes are very common in horse racing, when multiple horses race towards the finish line, with one often winning \"by a nose\" in those cases, while they can also be seen in any other type of race, including motorsports and cycling.\n\nWhat was said between Lyles and Thompson?\n\nLyles and Thompson were seen deep in conversation after the race as both competitors faced a wait to determine who was taking the gold medal.\n\nThe American has now shed light on what was said between the pair - revealing he actually thought his Jamaican rival had beaten him.\n\n\"After I passed [Seville] I saw Kishane out there I was like just do what I do, hit my top-end speed, let it work,\" Lyles told SportsMax TV (via Metro) \"To be honest, I didn't know if I had it. I leaned but I didn't know I had it.\n\n\"Me and Kishane were at the end waiting for our names to come up and I came back and I said, 'I'll be honest man, I think you got that one'. But my name came up and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\"\n\n\"I've waited a long time, I've seen Jamaicans dominate the 100m and 200m for so long and I remember growing up saying, 'when it's my turn I'm going to make sure that the US is on top'. And here it is, here's my time, my journey, my moment, it's such a beautiful thing to see.\"\n\nHow the lead changed during the race\n\nLyles didn't look remotely close to winning this race in the early stages, having the slowest reaction time of any sprinter with 0.178 - level with Letslie Tebogo - while Fred Kerley has the quickest with 0.108.\n\nHowever, Kerley could only claim bronze with a time of 9.81, while Lyles enjoyed a lightning chase to race past his rivals - despite being in last place after 40 metres of the race and being seventh at the halfway stage - before charging towards the finish line.\n\nHe had the quickest top speed of any runner in the race - 43.6km/h - which appears to have been crucial in him edging this race by the smallest of margins.\n\nWhat records were broken?\n\nSuch was the close nature of the 100m finish, world records were broken - but not for the men finishing in the podium places.\n\nAkani Simbine, Lamont Marcell Jacobs, Tebogo, Kenny Bednarek and Oblique Seville all registered the fastest times for those finishing between fourth and eighth in a 100m race, with times of 9.82, 9.85, 9.86, 9.88 and 9.91 respectively.\n\nLyles' time was impressive but still not quite enough to claim the world record for fastest time in the men's race - held by Usain Bolt (9.58).\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

When the Briton beat Lyles in a statement introduction in his heat on Saturday that appeared a realistic target.\n\nEven Lewis, with his vast experience as both a nine-time Olympic champion and coach at the University of Houston for the past decade, has been surprised by the remarkable rate of Hinchliffe's progress during their 12-month partnership.\n\nUnfortunately the final proved a step too far, with Hinchliffe run out of the non-automatic qualifying spots after finishing third behind Seville and Lyles in his semi-final.\n\n\"It's obviously not the result I wanted but I can't be too hard on myself,\" Hinchliffe, already the sixth-fastest British man in history, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I'll definitely use this experience and I'll learn from my mistakes, so it is back to the drawing board and we'll work on it and come back stronger next year.\"\n\nIt also was not to be for Hughes, who could not set up the opportunity to replicate the breakthrough first global medal he achieved last year - or for Olympic redemption following his false start in the Tokyo final three years ago.\n\nThe 29-year-old has not been able to hit the same heights of a 2023 season in which he broke two long-standing British records over 100m and 200m, after this campaign was disrupted by a hamstring injury.\n\n\"Obviously I'm disappointed but I know where I am coming from. This is my third 100m. Not making any excuses. Today just wasn't my day,\" Hughes, who will also contest the 200m, said.\n\n\"To try to get through the rounds of the Olympics after injuring my hamstring with a grade two tear last month wasn't that easy, but I dug deep to give myself a chance and that's what I came here to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Sunday night. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner -- with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said. \"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said. \"It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nALSO READ | Lyles wants US athletics to cash in on 100m triumph\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,\" he said. \"Everybody loves winners.\"\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish. Thompson knew it was close and immediately glanced at the scoreboard for an answer.\n\nHe waited. They all waited.\n\nLyles gave him a glimmer of hope, though.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I even said, 'Bro, I think you got that one big dog.

Noah Lyles of United States celebrates after winning gold. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez\n\nAfter all the talk and all the hype, Noah Lyles duly delivered when it mattered most when he won a superlative Olympic 100 metres final by five thousandths of a second on Sunday to give the United States the title for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIn the most competitive final of all time, there was a blanket finish, with the stadium scoreboard initially flashing a photo to separate the first seven athletes and Lyles believing he had lost.\n\nHe was then confirmed him as the winner in a personal best 9.79 seconds, the same time as Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, but ahead by the width of a vest.\n\nIf the race had been 99 metres Thompson would have been celebrating a fourth Jamaican win in five Olympics, but fast-finishing Lyles kept his form superbly and timed his dip expertly to add Olympic gold to his world title.\n\nHe ripped his bib name from his shirt and held it aloft with his red, white and blue varnished fingernails, announcing himself, as he had always promised he would be, as the fastest man in the world.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" said Lyles, the first American Olympic 100m champion since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\n\"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nIt was the first time eight men have broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal 100 metres race.\n\nTHOMPSON DISAPPOINTED\n\n\"I am a bit disappointed, but I am happy at the same time,\" Thompson said. \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learnt from it.\"\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold, everybody love winners. I would have loved to win today, but big up to the whole field.\"\n\nAmerican Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81 and Akani Simbini of South Africa was fourth, making it a remarkable six fourth or fifth-placed finishes in global championships, albeit with the consolation of a national record of 9.83.\n\nDefending champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, heavily strapped, finished fifth in 9.85 and Letsile Tebogo of Botswana also set a national record with 9.86 in sixth place.\n\nSuch was the quality of the race, that eighth-placed Oblique Seville of Jamaica still clocked 9.91 seconds.\n\nSeville had finished ahead of Lyles in 9.81 in the semi-final when the American looked to be at full stretch.\n\nHowever, the biggest showman in the sport and the star of the runaway success Netflix SPRINT series, has become a serious championship operator over the shorter distance, having won three 200m world titles and bronze over that distance at the last Olympics.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practice over the years',\" he said. \"It's accumulated to this point.\"\n\nLyles, 27, is targeting a possible four golds in Paris, in the 100m, his favourite 200m, the 4x100m relay and, possibly, the 4x400m relay.\n\nThat would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with long jump instead of the longer relay.\n\nFormer world champion Kerly ran an excellent race to add bronze to his Tokyo silver medal.\n\n\"That was a great race and anyone could have won it,\" he said. \"I feel that I executed as best as I could. I came here for the gold and nothing else but, hey, everybody came here for the same thing and only one can win. Whoever came off the best, is the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com", "name": "Bdnews24 Com",

Lyles, featured in the Netflix Sprint documentary, feels he deserves a personalized shoe after adding the Olympic title to his three World Athletics Championship titles from Budapest last year.\n\n\"I want my own shoe - my own trainer,\" said Lyles, who is sponsored by Adidas. \"There's no money in spikes. Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. Considering the medals we win and the recognition we get, it's crazy this hasn't happened.\"\n\nAmong the fans at the Stade de France was American rapper Snoop Dogg, whom Lyles jokingly challenged to a race. \"As the Olympic champion, I hold the title of the world's fastest man. This has been years in the making,\" he said.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles admitted he initially thought he had lost in the photo-finish. \"We were waiting for the results, and I honestly told Kishane, 'I think you've got this, big dog.' He was in lane 4, and I was in lane 7, so I couldn't see clearly. I was ready to see his name pop up, but when I saw mine, I thought, 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible.' This is the one I wanted. Everyone was prepared for the fight, and I wanted to prove that I'm the best among them all. I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nLyles is set to compete in the men's 200m heats on Monday and is confident about winning gold, potentially challenging Usain Bolt's world record. \"I am very confident,\" he said. \"Kenny Bednarek's fast time in the trials woke me up. But none of them will win. When I come off the turn, they'll be disheartened.\"\n\nFred Kerley, who won bronze and was next to Lyles at the press conference, reacted with skepticism, saying, \"You're talking nonsense, man.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Swastika-Website-design-26.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But then my name popped up and I thought 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\"\n\nThompson disappointed\n\nThompson arrived in Paris as the fastest man in the world this year (9.77) and was the quickest of the semi-finalists on Sunday with 9.80.\n\n\"I am a bit disappointed, but I am happy at the same time,\" he said. \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line in the position that I know I could have gone to.\"\n\nFormer world champion Kerley also ran an excellent race to add bronze to his Tokyo silver.\n\n\"That was a great race and anyone could have won it,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel that I executed as best as I could. I came here for the gold and nothing else but, hey, everybody came here for the same thing and only one can win. Whoever came off the best, is the best.\"\n\nSeville had finished ahead of Lyles in the semi-final when the American looked to be at full stretch.\n\nHowever, the biggest showman in the sport and the star of the runaway success Netflix SPRINT series, has become a serious championship operator over the shorter distance, having won three 200m world titles and 200m bronze at the last Olympics.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practice over the years',\" he said, adding that he felt rattled after the semi and called one of his therapists for advice.\n\nREAD MORE: Simone Biles wins her

I came here for the gold and nothing else but, hey, everybody came here for the same thing and only one can win. Whoever came off the best, is the best.\"\n\nSeville had finished ahead of Lyles in the semi-final when the American looked to be at full stretch.\n\nHowever, the biggest showman in the sport and the star of the runaway success Netflix SPRINT series, has become a serious championship operator over the shorter distance, having won three 200m world titles and 200m bronze at the last Olympics.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practice over the years',\" he said, adding that he felt rattled after the semi and called one of his therapists for advice.\n\nLyles, 27, is targeting a possible four golds in Paris, in the 100m, his favorite 200m, the 4x100m relay and, possibly, the 4x400m relay.\n\nThat would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with long jump instead of the longer relay.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/images/instant_news/20240805/20240805115439contentPhoto1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Before his impressive victory in Paris, Lyles made some remarks about the NBA.\n\nThe 27-year-old runner dissed the league for claiming to be world champions when they mainly compete in the USA. His remarks didn't sit well with a huge portion of the basketball world, which led them to call him out for not finding any success either. However, with Lyles' recent victory, he has proven to be a legitimate critic.\n\nJoel Embiid spotted leaving after Noah Lyles' win\n\nWhile the majority of the Americans in attendance were celebrating Lyles' gold medal win, one particular citizen wasn't happy about it. NBA star Joel Embiid was spotted walking out of the arena immediately after Lyles' triumphance.\n\nWhile it was Embiid's back that was seen in the footage, there's no mistaking it was him given his prominent features. As mentioned earlier, Lyles made negative remarks regarding NBA players claiming to be world champions. Seeing him take home the gold likely left a sour taste in Embiid's mouth.\n\nGiven the circumstances, Team USA, particularly the men's basketball team, now has a bit of pressure. Their entire lineup consists of NBA players. With that in mind, they now need to prove that they are still worthy of calling themselves world champions. If they end up losing this year, they'll surely never hear the end of Lyles' remarks.\n\nReactions from other NBA players and legends\n\nDespite the controversy Lyles brought upon the NBA world, some still showed appreciation to the 27-year-old. Two notable names who had some nice things to say were Magic Johnson and Dwyane Wade.\n\nWe're all on the yacht cheering for Noah Lyles after winning the Men's 100M race and remaining the fastest man in the world,\" Johnson said. \"It's the first time in 20 years that the US brings home the gold in the Men's 100! Wow - what an exciting race!\n\nAs for Wade, he simply acknowledged Lyles with a celebratory expression.\n\nThen there were other reactions from Josh Hart and Evan Turner. Hart's reaction was particularly notable due to the fact that he immediately ate his words after Lyles' win. He let the world know on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he's a hater of Lyles. Hart then had no choice but to respect his victory.\n\nWith all that in mind, Lyles has now backed up his being loud-mouthed to the NBA world.

Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner -- with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said. \"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said. \"It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,\" he said. \"Everybody loves winners.\"\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish. Thompson knew it was close and immediately glanced at the scoreboard for an answer.\n\nHe waited. They all waited.\n\nLyles gave him a glimmer of hope, though.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I even said, 'Bro, I think you got that one big dog. And then my name popped up, and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\"\n\nThompson became the first Jamaican to be on the podium in the men's Olympic 100 since Bolt's run of three straight titles in 2008, '12 and '16.\n\n\"My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad,\" Thompson said. \"I'm super grateful.\"\n\nThompson entered the race with the fastest time of the season and was viewed as the biggest threat to Lyles. It came down to the wire with all eight sprinters separated by a margin of .12 seconds -- and even closer for gold and silver.\n\n\"That close,\" Thompson said. \"It was that close.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@news-gazette.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianmarco_Tamberi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianmarco Tamberi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutaz_Essa_Barshim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutaz Essa Barshim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/news-gazette.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e462f33a-3c65-11ec-b3f1-2f038a8f66b4.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

His success in Paris followed a dominant showing at the World Championships in Budapest, where he won gold in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay.\n\nAt 27, Lyles is positioning himself as the heir to Usain Bolt's throne, not just with his performances on the track but also with his off-track charisma. His contract renewal with Adidas -- described as the biggest since Bolt's with Puma -- and his starring role in the Netflix docuseries Sprint underscore his growing influence in athletics.\n\nLyles has openly discussed his struggles with mental health, including depression and the pressures of fame. Yet, he thrives under scrutiny, often performing better with more eyes on him. His ability to handle pressure was evident as he navigated the longest preliminaries in Olympic history and emerged victorious in the final.\n\nWith one gold medal secured, Lyles is now aiming for more. After the 100m at the Olympics, he will compete in his signature 200m event on August 6, where he is a three-time defending world champion. He also plans to add the 4x100m and possibly the 4x400m relay to his medal tally.\n\nReflecting on his journey and aspirations, Lyles said, \"Usain Bolt has done it and him saying to me that he sees what I am doing and he respects it, it is amazing. I am the guy who wants to move past being track-famous. I want people to see me on the track, but in GQ and my docu-series, and realize I'm a cool guy too.\"\n\nAs the Olympic champion and the new \"World's Fastest Man,\" Noah Lyles continues to build his legacy, both on and off the track, aiming to elevate the sport of athletics to new heights.", "source": {"uri": "lifestyleasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lifestyle Asia HK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "60 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/05183800/noah-lyles-100m-gold-medal-dodges-nba-firestorm-paris-2024-olympics-news-info-002.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2342, "textEnd": 2350}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Saint- All the overhead shots and race replays tell the same story. Noah Lyles only led one time during his Olympic 100-meter sprint for the ages: at the finish line.\n\nSaint-Denis (France(), Aug 5 (AP) All the overhead shots and race replays tell the same story. Noah Lyles only led one time during his Olympic 100-meter sprint for the ages: at the finish line.\n\nThere's a good argument that the rest of his stay at these Paris Games won't be anywhere near as nip-and-tuck.\n\nAlso Read | Washington Sundar, Gus Atkinson, Charlie Cassell Shortlisted for ICC Men's Player of the Month Award for July 2024.\n\nWith the Olympics still abuzz over his .005-second victory in the 100, Lyles didn't have much time to rest before moving to his next event. He is a heavy favorite in the 200 meters, his better race, and a race he has not lost since the Olympic final in Tokyo three years ago, where he finished third. Opening heats for the 200 were set for Monday night.\n\nLyles' willingness -- make that, desire -- to be the front man for a sport that yearns for new fans feels like a game-changer to Seb Coe, the World Athletics president who called Sunday's race \"if not perfect, about as close to perfect as you can get.\"\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: Kiran Pahal Finishes Seventh In Her 400 M Round 1 Qualification Heat, Will Run in Repechage for Spot in Semifinals.\n\n\"If I'm wearing a promoter's hat, then him winning last night was important, because he's now creating a narrative that's heading us back into Usain Bolt territory,\" Coe said. \"That's hugely important.\"\n\nLyles not shy about what he wants from all thisIn a typically candid and engaging post-race news conference, Lyles made no secret that he is in this to promote his sport, but also wants more.\n\nHe has been a front man for the popular Netflix documentary \"SPRINT,\" and has brought a sense of fashion back to the track, making \"walk-ins\" a thing and bedazzling his hair with white pearls on race day.\n\nNow, he's got a message for his shoe sponsor, Adidas.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" he said. \"I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious. I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes, there's money in sneakers. I feel like for how many medals we bring back and the notoriety we get, the fact that hasn't happened, that's crazy for me. I feel like that needs to happen.\"\n\nWhat could slow down Lyles in his quest for Olympic sprint glory?The 100 was the biggest hurdle for Lyles to overcome. It is not his best race, and it's the one he took up shortly after Tokyo with the goal of becoming more than a mere sprinter, but a larger-than-life personality, both on and off the track.\n\nLyles also figures to feature prominently in the men's 4x100 relay but that's anything but a gimme.\n\nRiddled with poor work with the baton, a lack of consistent training habits, a doping positive and the constant spectre of trying to beat Bolt, the U.S. has not won, and kept, a single Olympic medal in this event since 2004. It hasn't captured gold since 2000.\n\nHe'll have challengers in the 200 meters, but he's hard to beatThe relay is a bigger threat to Lyles' quest to win three gold medals, the way Bolt did in all three of his appearances, than the 200 meters.\n\nLyles figures to get his biggest challenge in the 200 from Kenny Bednarek, who finished ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and, more recently, pushed him at a fast Olympic trails that Lyles won in 19.53.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tobogo, American Erryion Knighton and defending champion Andre De Grasse are also in the mix. One interesting wager would be whether Lyles has more of a chance of losing the race or lowering his American record of 19.31. Bolt's world record is 19.19.

Judges would declare Lyles the winner, leading to a belated correction from the broadcast crew and giving the mistaken call some viral attention.\n\nThe incorrect call from NBC drew some strong pushback from fans, including some who said the missed call marred what was otherwise a historically close race. Lyles earned the victory with a career-best time of 9.794 seconds, putting him just 0.005 seconds ahead of Thompson for the gold medal.\n\n\"What a race. And quite possibly the worst call in history by Leigh Diffey,\" one person shared on X. \"Declared the wrong winner on a photo finish, then extended silence while Lyles celebrated. Brutal\"\n\nOthers suggested Diffey should have shown more restraint on what was obvious to be an incredibly close finish, spoiling the way history will see the race.\n\n\"I like Leigh Diffey a lot, but he really blew this call, why didn't he wait, or say, photo finish? Declaring Thompson the winner immediately makes this footage unusable,\" another person posted on X.\n\nThe race was so close that Lyles admitted afterward even he thought Thompson had crossed the finish line first.\n\n\"We were waiting for the names to pop up, and I'm going to be honest, I came over [to Thompson] and I was like: 'I think you got that one, big dawg!'\" Lyles told reporters after the race, via ESPN. \"Something said I need to lean, and I was like, 'I'm going to lean,' because it's that type of race.\"\n\nBut Lyles added that he was prepared for a close race, having trained with the knowledge that he may need any edge he can find.\n\n\"What's crazy is my [biomechanist] Ralph Mann, before I left for Paris, he's like, 'This is how close first and second is going to be away from each other,'\" Lyles said as he held up a tiny bit of space between his thumb and forefinger. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nLyles was trailing Thompson for much of the race, making a move in the final 10 meters and leaning forward as the two reached the finish line together. Though Thompson's foot actually crossed the finish line first, races are determined when a sprinter's torso crosses the finish line, and Lyles' lean earned him the gold medal.\n\nAfter the race, Thompson said he was \"grateful\" for the experience but still felt disappointment.\n\n\"I'm going to be disappointed, but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,\" Thompson said. \"I just got to take it as what it is and just move forward from here.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_dougherty@heavy.com", "name": "Nathan Dougherty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Diffey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leigh Diffey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Index finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Noah-Lyles-1-e1722813812589.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

But then my name popped up and I thought 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\"\n\nThompson arrived in Paris as the fastest man in the world this year (9.77) and was the quickest of the semi-finalists on Sunday with 9.80.\n\n\"I am a bit disappointed, but I am happy at the same time,\" he said. \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line in the position that I know I could have gone to.\"\n\nFormer world champion Kerley also ran an excellent race to add bronze to his Tokyo silver.\n\n\"That was a great race and anyone could have won it,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel that I executed as best as I could. I came here for the gold and nothing else but, hey, everybody came here for the same thing and only one can win. Whoever came off the best, is the best.\"\n\nSeville had finished ahead of Lyles in the semi-final when the American looked to be at full stretch.\n\nHowever, the biggest showman in the sport and the star of the runaway success Netflix SPRINT series, has become a serious championship operator over the shorter distance, having won three 200m world titles and 200m bronze at the last Olympics.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practise over the years',\" he said, adding that he felt rattled after the semi and called one of his therapists for advice.\n\nLyles, 27, is targeting a possible four golds in Paris, in the 100m, his favourite 200m, the 4x100m relay and, possibly, the 4x400m relay.\n\nThat would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with long jump instead of the longer relay.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Saint- Kishane Thompson let out a scream after crossing the finish line that was fitting of an Olympic 100-meter champion. Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nSaint-Denis (France), Aug 5 (AP) Kishane Thompson let out a scream after crossing the finish line that was fitting of an Olympic 100-meter champion. Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Sunday night. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner -- with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: Noah Lyles Takes Away Gold Medal by Whisker in Men's 100-Meter Final.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said. \"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: India To Take On Germany in Semifinals of Men's Hockey.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said. \"It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,\" he said. \"Everybody loves winners.\"\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish. Thompson knew it was close and immediately glanced at the scoreboard for an answer.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I even said, 'Bro, I think you got that one big dog. And then my name popped up, and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm amazing.'\"\n\nThompson became the first Jamaican to be on the podium in the men's Olympic 100 since Bolt's run of three straight titles in 2008, '12 and '16.\n\n\"My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad,\" Thompson said. \"I'm super grateful.\"\n\nThompson entered the race with the fastest time of the season and was viewed as the biggest threat to Lyles. It came down to the wire with all eight sprinters separated by a margin of .12 seconds -- and even closer for gold and silver.\n\n\"That close,\" Thompson said. \"It was that close.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianmarco_Tamberi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianmarco Tamberi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutaz_Essa_Barshim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutaz Essa Barshim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 255, "textEnd": 260}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It's the fifth gold medal won by Americans on Sunday (golfer Scottie Scheffler, cyclist Kristen Faulkner, swimmer Bobby Finke, and the women's 4\u00d7100 medley relay team).\n\nThe 27-year-old ran a 9.83 in the semifinal, automatically qualifying by finishing second in that race. He caught some flack on Saturday for finishing in second place in a heat, saying that his \"plan\" was to finish in first from there on out. That didn't happen - but it'll all be forgotten about now, as he finished first when it mattered most.\n\nOf course, some will argue he brought the hate upon himself when he quipped that NBA champions do not have the right to call themselves world champions. That comment alone has caused him to be hated by American sports fans just as much, maybe more, than he is loved by them. But, perhaps this victory can change the tide.\n\nLyles will now turn his focus on the 200m (he's said his \"dream goal\" is to break Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19) and the 4x100m relay. It remains up in the air about whether he will be part of the 4x400m relay, but he was a part of the silver-medal winning team at this year's world indoor championships.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital back in March, Lyles said a friend told him, \"'Forget three, you need to go after four. Do something no one's ever done.'\"\n\n\"When you want to talk about being the greatest, that's what you have to achieve. So, I announced that that is a goal of mine to complete; why not do it on the biggest stage, the Olympics?\" Lyles said of a potential fourth Olympic event.\n\n\"I think track does better when we do have a superstar. That's why I think if Noah were to win, he would elevate the sport as well. As opposed to saying 'I wonder who's going to win,' people want to say 'I want him' or 'I don't want him.' They want to root for someone, or root against someone. I think it creates more intensity when you have someone that dominates, and that's been throughout history. . . . People have really gravitated to the sport when people really dominated more.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USA-sprinter-Noah-Lyles-wins-first-Olympic-gold-in-epic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Lyles is racing in the sixth heat in the first round, which starts at 1:55 p.m. ET. Assuming Lyles moves on, he'll race in the semifinals on Wednesday, Aug. 7 at 2:02 p.m. ET.\n\nThe men's 200m final is scheduled for Thursday, Aug. 8 at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nLyles personal-best time in the men's 200m is 19.31 and his best this season is 19.53. He won the bronze medal in the men's 200m in Tokyo in 2020. He's a favorite to win the gold but will have tough competition.

Lyles would be in good company to win both the 100m and 200m at the same Olympics.

100m gold drought in historic final", "body": "Noah Lyles delivered when it mattered most on Sunday night when he won a sensational Paris 2024 Olympics men's 100 metres final by five thousandths of a second to give the United States of America the title for the first time in 20 years.\n\nThe last time USA won men's 100m gold was at Athens 2004 through Justin Gatlin, and the hyperactive Lyles got them back the title in one of the greatest sprint races of all time in Paris.\n\nIn the most competitive final ever, there was a blanket finish, with the stadium scoreboard initially flashing a photo to separate the first seven athletes and Lyles believing he had lost.\n\nHe was then confirmed as the winner in a personal best 9.79 seconds, the same time as Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, but ahead by the width of a vest.\n\nThe fast-finishing Lyles trailed for most of the race but kept his form superbly and timed his dip expertly to add Olympic gold to his world title.\n\nHe ripped his bib name from his shirt and held it aloft with his red, white and blue varnished fingernails, announcing himself, as he had always promised he would be, as the fastest man in the world.\n\n\"It's the one I wanted, it's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents,\" said Lyles.\n\n\"Everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man among all of them, I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nIt was the first time eight men have broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal 100 metres race.\n\n\"I am a bit disappointed, but I am happy at the same time,\" said Thompson, the fastest man in the world this year. \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learnt from it.\"\n\nAnother United States of America athlete, Fred Kerley, clinched bronze in 9.81s, while South Africa's Akani Simbine just missed out on a medal, finishing fourth in a new national record of 9.82s.\n\nThe final was the deepest 100m race of all time, with all the runners clocking sub-10 seconds, Jamaica's Oblique Seville timing 9.91s to finish in eighth and last place.", "source": {"uri": "thestreetjournal.org",

Despite his young age, it quickly became clear he had immense sprinting talent, and the teenager went on to win a 200m gold medal at the 2014 Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing.\n\nIn 2016, Lyles and his younger brother Josephus decided to forgo college to become professional athletes. He just missed out on selection for the US team heading to the Olympic Games in Rio, but now, 10 years on from winning a gold medal at the Youth Olympic Games, Lyles is aiming to imitate Bolt in Paris.\n\nIt won't be the first time Lyles competes at the Olympic Games. He raced at Tokyo 2020, and after earning 200m and 4x100m world titles for the first time in 2019, was considered a favourite for gold in the Japanese capital. But he was unable to make his mark, settling for a bronze medal in the 200m.\n\nLyles has raised his game since then. He clinched another 200m world title in 2022, before sweeping the 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the 2023 World Athletics Championships to rightly earn the title of the fastest man in the world right now.\n\nHis best time across 200m is 19.31 seconds, surpassing the previous American record of 19.32 -- set by Michael Johnson since 1996. The time makes Lyles the fastest 200m runner in history, behind only Bolt and Yohan Blake.\n\nLyles then went on to win the 100m final in Paris by 0.0005 of a second in a time of 9.79 seconds.\n\nLyles often appears to wear the red, white and blue of the Star-Spangled Banner with pride, but he revealed to Fox News that he often has mixed feelings about representing his home.\n\n\"It's a bittersweet moment,\" he explained. \"I'm American, and I truly believe that we are the best in the world, especially when it comes to sports. We have definitely been proving that dominance. And it feels good to add on to that collection that the US is the best.\n\n\"But at the same time, it's with a heavy heart, because being black in America, there's a lot to deal with. I'm not going to go into everything, but it's not easy. It's hard to love the country that sometimes doesn't love you back.\n\n\"At the same time, you always want to put your best foot forward. So, it's a little contradicting, it's with a heavy heart, but it still makes you feel extremely proud because you are an American.\"\n\nLyles also annoyed a number of his country's basketball stars last year after hitting out at the tendency to describe the winners of the NBA Finals as world champions.\n\nHe made the comments during a press conference after his third gold medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, having been asked about the state of track and field as a sport.\n\n\"You know what hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"World champion of what? The United States? Don't get me wrong. I love the US -- at times -- but that ain't the world. That is not the world. We are the world.\n\n\"We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show that they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA. We gotta do more. We gotta be presented to the world.\"\n\nPhoenix Suns star Kevin Durant, who earned an Olympic gold medal in the men's basketball tournament at Tokyo 2020, was among the NBA players to respond, posting on social media: \"Somebody help this brother.\"\n\nWhile he may have riled up some of his compatriots, they certainly won't mind if he returns to the US this summer with three Olympic gold medals around his neck.\n\nBut Lyles is not just aiming to make a mark on the track. Self-described as an artist and rapper, he is also passionate about music, fashion and video games. Lyles has previously spoken about his desire to revolutionise athletics through his other interests.\n\n\"I want to show people how far they can really go,\" he told Olympics.com. \"I don't want them to stop at medals. Yes, medals are nice, they get your attention. That should be the first stopping point, that should be the first check off the box.\n\n\"After you go to medals, now you go to moving outside of the sport. After you're outside of the sport, we go and reinvent ourselves.\"\n\nBolt was often rightly credited with transforming athletics into an exciting and engaging sport -- Lyles now has the chance to follow in his footsteps and continue the evolution at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gatlin claimed gold in the 100m, while Crawford triumphed over the longer distance.\n\nAfter that, Bolt completely dominated men's sprinting, winning both the 100m and 200m at three successive Olympic Games.\n\nThe Jamaicans record-shattering performances and irrepressible personality transformed him into a global icon, leaving little room for American sprinters to shine.\n\nLyles has proved to be the solution to this problem, already winning one gold medal with the 200m and 4x100m to come.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who is the reigning world champion across both distances, became a professional athlete in 2016.\n\nAfter earning 200m and 4x100m world titles for the first time in 2019, Lyles finished with a bronze medal in the 200m at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nHe was disappointed with missing out on the gold medal in the Japanese capital, but he bounced back almost immediately. Another 200m world title came in 2022, before Lyles swept the 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\nThe track and field star has stepped up another level this year, setting a 9.83 seconds to win the 100m at the US Olympic trials and qualify for Paris 2024.\n\nLyles has looked equally dominant in the 200m. He ran an event record of 19.53 seconds at the US Olympic trials, consigning Bednarek to second place.\n\nHe then ran an even faster time in the 100m final, winning the race in 9.79 seconds.\n\nBolt's dominance in the 100m and 200m, combined with his charismatic showmanship, set a benchmark that is extraordinarily high.\n\nBut Lyles has shown that he possesses similar qualities. He has a vibrant personality and a genuine love for entertaining the crowd, for example.\n\n\"Being able to run with passion, and a smile on your face, and turning a race into something for everybody to enjoy, that's what I consider running with soul,\" Lyles said in a recent interview with Time Magazine.\n\n\"It just means that I'm happy. I love to do what I do. And that's a dangerous guy.\"\n\nLyles has been showing off his personality during the US Olympic trials, bringing out a Yu-Gi-Oh card and showing it to the camera before every race. He has previously spoken of his love of anime, as well as music, fashion and video games.\n\nBut it is on the track where Lyles truly shines. His blend of explosive speed and technical proficiency makes him a formidable competitor.\n\nThe Olympics in Paris is a crucial juncture in Lyles' career. With Bolt retired, men's sprinting is now wide open, and Lyles has grabbed his chance to become his heir.\n\nThe pressure is immense. Not only is Lyles vying for personal glory, but he also carried the hopes of a nation starved of sprinting success. A gold medal in the French capital could also symbolise the resurgence of American sprinting.\n\nLyles has the opportunity to follow in Bolt's footsteps and be a transformative figure in athletics. While this is an enormous task, Lyles believes he could be even more influential than Bolt, particularly in the US.\n\n\"That's my plan,\" he told Time Magazine. \"I have the personality, I have the speed, I have the showmanship. I have the marketing mindset. I'm willing to be uncomfortable.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nancy_gillen@talksport.com", "name": "Nancy Gillen", "type":

Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Sunday night. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner -- with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said. \"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close of race. It would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offense to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said. \"It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nThe race was barely over and Thompson was already replaying the little things that could've made a big difference. Maybe more of a lean. Maybe a bit more patience to let his speed propel him to the finish line.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold,\" he said. \"Everybody loves winners.\"\n\nThompson was in Lane 4 in the final and Lyles in Lane 7. He couldn't see Lyles out that far so he wasn't sure precisely where he stood right after the finish.

But then my name popped up and I thought 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\"\n\nTHOMPSON DISAPPOINTED\n\nThompson arrived in Paris as the fastest man in the world this year (9.77) and was the quickest of the semi-finalists on Sunday with 9.80.\n\n\"I am a bit disappointed, but I am happy at the same time,\" he said. \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line in the position that I know I could have gone to.\"\n\nFormer world champion Kerley also ran an excellent race to add bronze to his Tokyo silver.\n\n\"That was a great race and anyone could have won it,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel that I executed as best as I could. I came here for the gold and nothing else but, hey, everybody came here for the same thing and only one can win. Whoever came off the best, is the best.\"\n\nSeville had finished ahead of Lyles in the semi-final when the American looked to be at full stretch.\n\nHowever, the biggest showman in the sport and the star of the runaway success Netflix SPRINT series, has become a serious championship operator over the shorter distance, having won three 200m world titles and 200m bronze at the last Olympics.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practise over the years',\" he said, adding that he felt rattled after the semi and called one of his therapists for advice.\n\nLyles, 27, is targeting a possible four golds in Paris, in the 100m, his favourite 200m, the 4x100m relay and, possibly, the 4x400m relay.\n\nThat would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with long jump instead of the longer relay.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20240805/c1_2841677_700.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTimeline: Deere has cut 2,700 jobs in 10 months in Iowa and Illinois West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M Bremer Avenue bridge in Waverly to be demolished, closed for a year starting Thursday Helicopter crashed near Nashua after striking powerlines, killing pilot UPDATE: Man charged with TC damage said he was 'blackout drunk' Waterloo man arrested following short chase Waterloo residents have more than 1,000 signatures on petition to put high school plan on the ballot Autistic man accused of breaking into co-worker's home to plant letter, smear boyfriend Man charged with breaking into home to steal wiring for scrap UAW releases statement on John Deere layoffs, says cuts 'kill good American jobs' Pablo's Mexican Grill marking 20 years on Main Street in downtown Cedar Falls Waterloo school board approves $165 million plan to to merge high schools by 2028-29 Oelwein man arrested for gun after found passed out in garage John Deere idled more than 300 workers in Quad Cities on Wednesday, bringing last week's total to 489 Allen Hospital among nation's top performing hospitals for treatment of heart attack\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

I went up to him while we were waiting, and said 'I think you've got that, good going', and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing',\" Lyles said.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it.\"\n\nReflecting on narrowly missing out on gold, 23-year-old Thompson said: \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learned from it.\"\n\nThe drama at the head of the race inspired world records behind it.\n\nThe finishing times for Akani Simbine, Lamont Marcell Jacobs, Tebogo, Kenny Bednarek and Seville were all records for fourth to eighth place finishers in a 100m race.\n\nSouth Africa's Simbine ran a personal best for fourth and said: \"Missing the medal by 0.01, it's actually really crazy, but yeah, I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nLyles building legacy with each global gold\n\nLyles has long positioned himself as the heir to Usain Bolt's throne, combining on-track performances with off-track flair in his bid to establish himself as the new superstar of men's athletics.\n\nNot afraid to raise expectations through his own comments, Lyles has spoken about his desire to break the long-standing 100m and 200m records set by Jamaica's eight-time Olympic champion Bolt, who retired in 2017.\n\nThe American also claimed he will target four golds in Paris by adding the men's 4x400m relay to his schedule after winning the world 100m, 200m and 4x100m title in Budapest 12 months ago.\n\nLyles will next pursue the Olympic 200m title as a three-time defending world champion in the event, although he had to settle for bronze on his Games debut in Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"Lyles had a bad Tokyo and since then he's really been looking for big moments,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"He wants to be a global superstar. He talks about Usain Bolt and the type of person he was. He's talked about his sport and voiced his frustration about how it doesn't give you that platform.\"\n\nIt is 16 years since Bolt strolled to the first of his three Olympic 100m golds in Beijing, showboating as he crossed the line but still clocking a world record 9.69 - which he improved to the still-standing mark of 9.58 in 2009.\n\nLyles is yet to get close to that time, running under 9.80 for the first time to win on Sunday night, while his 200m best of 19.31 also trails Bolt's best (19.19).\n\nBut, like Bolt, Lyles stars on the sport's grandest stages and he continues to amass global golds at a considerable rate.\n\n\"Noah Lyles is able to back it up,\" Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis said on BBC TV.\n\n\"He has been amplifying the need for people to take this sport more seriously, deliver and respect the athletes for what they deliver, which is sensational entertainment every single time.\n\n\"To do this here, with the amphitheatre of the lights, the drama, everything, is just brilliant.\"\n\nJohnson added: \"He is here to create a legacy and he has put the first stamp down on that legacy by taking this title in such imperious fashion.\"", "source":

He had to wait some 30 seconds after the finish of one to find out he'd beaten Kishane Thompson of Jamaica. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock. Team USA's Kerley claimed bronze in 9.81. It was his second Olympic medal. He grabbed silver at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe word \"Photo\" popped up on the scoreboard next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others after they crossed the line. Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCorps of Cadets announces march-in schedule for Texas A&M football season Texas A&M student claims dorm mold caused adverse health effects Texas A&M announces 2024 class of distinguished alumni Krispy Kreme owner arrested for arson Teen victim identified in College Station homicide KBTX anchor Heather Kovar arrested for assault Activist protests against CPS system at Brazos County Courthouse Stephen F.

That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in.\"\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had [him] cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man.

In his explanation, Tirico said that Olympic races determine a victor when any part of the leading runner's torso crosses the vertical plane of the finish line.\n\nUSA Track & Field, the governing body that oversees Team USA's international track and field competitions, has similar language published in its 2024 USATF Competition Rules.\n\nOn page 67 of the document, under Rule 163 (which concerns running competitions), the first point states: \"Competitors shall be placed at the finish line in the order in which any part of their bodies (i.e., the 'torso,' as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, hands, legs, or feet) reaches the finish line.\"\n\nThe sports governing body World Athletics also has similar language in its technical rulebook for track and field competitions.\n\nOmega, the official provider of photo finish images at the 2024 Paris Olympics, shared the image of Lyles' victory at the men's 100-meter sprint.

When it came time to prove he was the fastest man in the world, it took considerably longer than his time of 9.78 seconds for Lyles to find out if he completed his mission.\n\nLyles and Jamaica's Kishane Thompson had to wait out the results of a photo finish that would determine two different legacies. The finish was so close, in fact, that the NBC broadcast initially labeled Thompson the winner. It was Lyles who ultimately got to celebrate a gold medal, allowing him to share an emotional moment with his mother.\n\nMORE MEN'S 100M: Lyles' mom's reaction | Last US man to win 100m gold\n\nWhile the wait was only a few additional seconds, there's no doubt it felt arduously long for both sprinters.\n\nHere's a look at the Olympic men's 100-meter photo finish and the tiebreaker rule that gave Lyles the edge.\n\nMORE: Explaining the Noah Lyles-NBA controversy\n\nLyles won the 100-meter final by .005 seconds. That's five-thousandths of a second, as both he and Thompson posted a time of 9.79 when rounded off.\n\nThompson's foot definitively crossed the finish line first, which might be one reason why the broadcast appeared to believe he was the winner. The foot isn't what matters, though. Lyles' torso crossed before Thompson's torso, and it took a close examination of the finish to determine that the American star had the edge.\n\nBelow is the official photo from the photo finish.\n\nThe Olympics uses imaging with Fully Automatic Timing to determine the winner. The camera takes continuous, narrow images of the finish line, allowing those in charge to see exactly when a runner crosses for the first time.\n\nThe winner was hard enough to determine in slow motion. In real time, it was virtually impossible to know who had the edge in those final couple of seconds.\n\nLyles hit a top speed of 27.1 mph during the race, ahead of Thompson's 26.8. That surge allowed him to catch up with Thompson just in time to lurch ahead for the victory despite trailing nearly the entire way.\n\nWhat a year it is for the photo finish, as the Kentucky Derby required a photo finish on the same weekend a NASCAR race required a photo finish in May. Those photo finishes are a bit simpler, though: who (or what) crossed the line first? In the case of the 100-meter, it's a question of which torso crossed first.\n\nHere are more details on how the winner was determined.\n\nMORE: When does Noah Lyles race next?\n\nThe 100-meter final went to a photo finish, but there wasn't necessarily a tiebreaker applied to determine the winner. In this case, it was determined that Lyles did cross the finish line just before Thompson did -- and it wasn't his feet that crossed first.\n\nA runner's finish is determined by the moment their torso crosses the finish line. The feet are not what get a runner over the finish line, just like a runner can't stick out their arm in hopes it crosses the finish line before the other competitors.\n\nThe head doesn't count, either, but you will almost always see sprinters stick out their heads when approaching the finish line because moving the head forward naturally moves the top of the torso forward. As soon as the torso crosses, the job is done.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_automatic_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fully automatic time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slow motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/USATSI_23910543.jpg?itok=OUvVy_yL", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out Thompson by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\" said Lyles, who was a high school track star in Virginia when he ran for T.C. Williams High School (now known as Alexandria City High).\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nThe top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nLyles and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nAlso Sunday, Hocker and Gourley did well in the 1,500 semifinals.\n\nHocker, a former University of Oregon star who has trained at Virginia Tech since November, finished third in his 12-man semifinal heat with a time of 3:32.54. The top six runners in each heat advanced to Tuesday's final.\n\nGourley, running for Great Britain, finished third in the other semifinal heat with a time of 3:32.11.\n\nGourley, a Scotland native, was third overall. Hocker, a Pennsylvania native running in his second Olympics, was 10th overall.\n\nAs a senior, Gourley ran the anchor leg for the Tech distance medley relay team that won gold at the 2018 NCAA indoor championships.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user

Fred Kerley, also of the US and the silver medallist at the Tokyo Olympics, finished third in 9.81. Marcel Jacobs, defending champion, finished fifth. It was the first time in history that eight men broke 10 seconds in a wind-legal race.\n\nLong considered one of the marquee events of the entire Olympic Games, the 100-metre final has catapulted winners to instant global fame. From 2008 through 2016, the event was dominated by reigning world record holder Usain Bolt of Jamaica, and while no sprinter has run within a tenth of a second of his fastest time of 9.58, Lyles has been positioning himself for years to inherit the position as the face of global sprinting.\n\nAs a recent star of the Netflix series Sprint, Lyles, 27, developed elaborate narratives around himself through each season, including one in the early part of this year by bringing a secretive metal briefcase to each meet, promising to reveal its contents at the US Olympic trials in June. The briefcase contained his running kit.\n\nTechnically superior at the 200 metres, in which his personal best of 19.31 is the third-best all-time, Lyles joked in the series that the 200 metres is his \"wife\", while the 100 metres is his \"mistress\".

Plenty of people watching wondered if he should conserve some energy but, clearly wanting to be the showman that the men's 100m has lacked ever since Usain Bolt, he continued his high-energy antics.\n\nThe wait between the athletes arriving out on the track and the actual start of the race felt interminable. Lengthy introductions, booming music, a spectacular light show, darkness and then a longer than anticipated wait for the bulbs inside the Stade de France to reach optimal brightness. That was before even the eight athletes had been called to their blocks before the silence that accompanied the starter's orders.\n\nWith Lyles's rivals having warmed themselves up with such vigour and precision on a separate track just outside the Stade de France, there was a theory that the wait might have particularly affected the two Jamaican sprinters, Oblique Seville and Thompson. They had looked capable of running so much faster in the heats and, while nerves may also have been a factor, they looked tight by comparison.\n\nLyles has never been a fast starter and, true to form, his reaction time from when the gun sounded and his feet actually left the blocks was the joint slowest in the entire field at 0.178sec. Thompson was crucially not much faster, ensuring that Fred Kerley, who was largely unfancied for gold, took an instant lead.\n\nSprinters then vary greatly in how long they keep their heads down but this next part of the race was excellent for Thompson who, by 30m, had taken the lead and was moving faster than anyone at 40.6km per hour. Lyles, who was now just touching that same speed, had taken much longer to get there and was actually still last out of all eight runners even at 30m.\n\nLyles had made the unexpected decision earlier this year to turn up at the World Indoor Championships and take on Christian Coleman, the best 60m runner in history over the distance. He could not win, but it was a critical decision for what would follow here in Paris. Knowing that he was the fastest finisher, Lyles desperately wanted to shorten the moment between the start of the race and when he was upright out of the 'drive phase' and ready to launch into full flight.\n\nThis transition was not instantly noticeable during the race, with Lyles still trailing Thompson at 40m but making crucial inroads into the rest of the field. By halfway, he had reached 43.5kph - almost his top speed during the race - which is quicker than anyone else managed through the full 100m. It meant that he had moved from eighth to third between 30m and 60m. This meant that it was now simply a question of holding his form and hoping that there would be enough track to complete his surge through the field.\n\nLyles had reached overdrive by 60m, peaking at 43.6kpm in the 10m to 70m, which is at the moment when those 100m specialists in front of him were starting to struggle to hold their form and just faltering into the final metres. What Lyles did then brilliantly here, however, was to maintain his concentration, keep relaxed and not allow the desperation that he would have felt at still not quite hitting the front to impact his running. He calls the 200m \"his wife\" and the 100m \"his mistress\" and knew that he just needed to stay faithful to his old instincts that had been honed from years of running over the longer sprint.\n\nIt was a masterful display of nerve and mind over matter just as much as pure physical speed or power. Yes, it was something that he had practised endlessly with his coach but to actually deliver it in front of a watching world was extraordinary.\n\nFew people are more sure of themselves than Lyles, but even he suspected that Thompson had won following a blanket finish. Incredibly, the scoreboard said that seven of the finalists were in the photo-finish and there was an agonising 20 seconds while they all just stopped and looked up at the big screen. The only finishing time that had been recorded was that of Seville, who was eighth, despite looking so dominant in beating Lyles in their semi-final.\n\nAnd then the result flashed up, Lyles's eyes almost popped out of his head to confirm that, by an almost unimaginably fine margin, he was the Olympic champion.\n\nThe difference between Lyles (9.784) and Thompson (9.789) was a ludicrously microscopic five-thousandths of a second. The subsequent overhead photo showed that Thompson's foot had actually crossed the line first but Lyles's superior lean into the finish line had sealed it for him.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Indoor_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Indoor Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/DML53FLCYBGUVIZXUAQCQ356IE.jpg?auth=43ca482ed267e8629270c4caa4d2a5070c3c134ce1d64193b695ce670af6e861&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&focal=519%2C362&smart=false", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I told him, 'I think you got that one'. I couldn't really see what was going on over there,\" he said as the world waited for the winner to be announced.\n\n\"I just had to keep running like I was going to win it. Something told me 'you need to lean'. This is how close first and second is going to be.\n\n\"It was a crazy moment. I did think that Kishane had that. I was like, 'I'm going to have to swallow my pride', which I don't have a problem doing.\n\n\"Everybody on the field came out knowing they could win this race. That's the mindset we have to have. Iron sharpens iron.\n\n\"I saw my name and was like, 'I didn't do this against a slow crowd, I did this against the best of the best, on the biggest stage with the biggest pressure'.\"\n\nLyles' whole career may boil down to that famous lunge for the line, but he says it's not something he has ever focused on.\n\n\"I would say I have a decent history with dipping at the line. Throughout my high-school career and stuff like that, a lot of races have come down to dips. I've been able to win.\"\n\nBriefly, ever so briefly, Thompson thought the glory could be his.\n\n\"I couldn't see him, but I thought he was seeing me,\" Thompson said of Lyles.\n\n\"He said, 'Hey Kishane I thought you got it,' and I said, 'I am not sure'.\n\n\"This is the closest medal.\"\n\nIt was almost cruel for Thompson to be asked if the medal should be shared between them.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offence to any other sport. It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\" he said.\n\n\"I'm feeling very good, honestly. My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold, everybody love winners. I would have loved to win today, but big up to the whole field.\"\n\nIn an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85sec, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86sec, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88sec and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91sec.\n\nMost of them will also be running in the 200m -- and the world will be desperately hoping to see something as special as the 100m was on Monday morning.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clavicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_assistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind assistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/64f8668b53955e2942a9c51b58e9a82d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Lyles also lost his opening-round heat -- to Britain's Louie Hinchliffe on Saturday. Hinchliffe finished third in the semifinal and did not advance.\n\nJoining Lyles in the eight-man final will be Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won his semifinal in 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in the three semifinal.

Fred Kerley came in third with a time of 9.81sec.\n\nWorld champion Noah Lyles roared to victory in 9.79sec to claim the men's Olympic 100m gold in Paris on Sunday.\n\nLyles became the first American, male or female, to win the event since Justin Gatlin won in the 2004 Athens Games.\n\nIn a photo-finish, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson claimed silver, just five-thousandths of a second off Lyles' pace.\n\nLyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81sec, just one-hundredth ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who timed 9.82sec.\n\nDefending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85sec, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86sec, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88sec and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91sec in an astonishing race.\n\nStarting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern.\n\nHead tucked down through to the 40-metre mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way.\n\nAs Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming bass-heavy music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters made the final adjustments to their starting blocks.\n\nThe lights were then shut off, the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum.\n\nCalled out over the tannoy, each sprinter was individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Games where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

First comes the vision. Then comes the pledge, almost as if he is trying to speak the vision into reality. Finally the delivery, the nuts and screws of cashing the cheques his words have already written for him. And in about the time it takes you to read this paragraph, he becomes the Olympic 100m champion.\n\nThe new undisputed king of men's sprinting is a kind of tortured genius, a manga and anime fan who likes painting his nails and his skateboards, who mentioned his therapist in his press conference, who understands better than most that the glory and the despair are basically two halves of a whole. Perhaps nothing captures this better than a final won by five-thousandths of a second, the breathtakingly cruel difference between Lyles and Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\nRelated: USA's Noah Lyles: manga geek, alpha male and very, very fast\n\nIt was one hell of a fight, which is just as well because there is nothing Lyles likes better. In a sport of pure air and clean straight lines, perhaps the simplest sport of all, Lyles thrives on the thrust of conflict, the fast-twitch muscles of competition and confrontation, the salt of his haters' tears and the salt of his own. Often it is said of athletes that the first yard is in their head. With Lyles, it is more accurate to say that the first yard is in his mouth.\n\nHe has, for example, insisted all season on calling himself the \"fastest man in the world\" even though Thompson has run what remains the fastest time this year; who calls out pretty much the entire NFL and NBA for having the temerity to call themselves world champions. Who described himself before the last Games as the three-time Olympic gold medallist and made it his phone screensaver, shortly before leaving Tokyo with a grand total of one bronze medal.\n\nWhat changed? Perhaps we discovered this a few seconds into the final. He had already been edged out by Oblique Seville of Jamaica in the semi-final and Louie Hinchliffe of Great Britain in his first-round heat.\n\nWhatever aura he still possessed from his clean sweep at the world championships in Budapest 12 months ago, let's just say it wasn't entirely evident 40 metres into the race, with Lyles dead last and Thompson ominously taking to the front.\n\nThompson is 23 and yet, until this still-warm Paris evening, remained something of an unknown quantity. A product of the famous MVP club in Kingston, his coach Stephen Francis has made a very conspicuous show of holding him back, keeping his talent under wraps like a Formula One prototype. After running 9.92sec in the heats of last year's national championships, Francis withdrew him before the final. At other times, he has ordered Thompson to ease up after 60 metres which - in hindsight - might not have been the greatest idea.\n\nBecause at around 50m, the point at which Thompson is usually springing the knees high and opening out into his devastating drive phase, something began to malfunction. His head began to sway from side to side, the arms hanging a little loosely. In the biggest race of his life, in his first major championship, in a moment of stress few of us can imagine, Thompson was wobbling.\n\nAnd perhaps this, ultimately, is where those five-thousandths of a second can be found. Lyles has seen things. He has known the pain of defeat, the numbness of depression, the sting of rejection, even humiliation, and come out the other side. More importantly, this is a technique tweaked and honed in miniaturised detail with his coach Lance Brauman, a mindset forged in long and often difficult therapy sessions.\n\nThe arm strokes were perfectly clean, the head in absolute stillness, and his mind presumably in a similar state. Lyles ate up those final few metres, and then the final few centimetres, some deep competitive urge that simply would not allow him to be beaten. A pregnant pause. The eyes of the world on a little blue screen. Then the verdict. A scream from Lyles, followed by a tear down the back straight, chased by dozens of photographers, the biggest athletic mismatch of the night.\n\nRelated: Yaroslava Mahuchikh rises to occasion to secure high jump gold for Ukraine\n\nWhat happens next is anyone's guess. Men's 100m champions from Jesse Owens to Usain Bolt have always been required to represent something larger than themselves, to be not just a champion but a figurehead, a polestar, a physical ideal and a relentless personal brand upon which tickets, hospitality packages and household items can reliably be sold.\n\nThis was a task too far for the defending champion Marcell Jacobs. Perhaps it came a little soon for Thompson too, an athlete still discovering the outer limits of himself, and who will have learned so much.\n\nFor Lyles, on the other hand, this is the role he always dreamed for himself. Through the tainted and confusing post-Bolt years, the brief interregnums of Justin Gatlin and Kerley, Jacobs and Christian Coleman, athletics has been searching - not without a certain internal contradiction - for a successor to its freakish once-in-a-generation sprinting god.\n\nAnd as the achievement began to dawn on him, Lyles began to slow a little. He stopped leaping and gurning for the cameras. He looked up at the stands and for a few seconds he fell completely silent, with all the solemnity of a man who has kept a sacred promise.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Noah Lyles only led one time during his Olympic 100-meter sprint for the ages: at the finish line.\n\nThere's a good argument that the rest of his stay at these Paris Games won't be anywhere near as nip-and-tuck.\n\nWith the Olympics still abuzz over his .005-second victory in the 100, Lyles didn't have much time to rest before moving to his next event. He is a heavy favorite in the 200 meters, his better race, and a race he has not lost since the Olympic final in Tokyo three years ago, where he finished third. Opening heats for the 200 were set for Monday night.\n\nLyles' willingness -- make that, desire -- to be the front man for a sport that yearns for new fans feels like a game-changer to Seb Coe, the World Athletics president who called Sunday's race \"if not perfect, about as close to perfect as you can get.\"\n\n\"If I'm wearing a promoter's hat, then him winning last night was important, because he's now creating a narrative that's heading us back into Usain Bolt territory,\" Coe said. \"That's hugely important.\"\n\nIn a typically candid and engaging post-race news conference, Lyles made no secret that he is in this to promote his sport, but also wants more.\n\nHe has been a front man for the popular Netflix documentary \"SPRINT,\" and has brought a sense of fashion back to the track, making \"walk-ins\" a thing and bedazzling his hair with white pearls on race day.\n\nNow, he's got a message for his shoe sponsor, Adidas.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" he said. \"I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious. I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes, there's money in sneakers. I feel like for how many medals we bring back and the notoriety we get, the fact that hasn't happened, that's crazy for me. I feel like that needs to happen.\"\n\nThe 100 was the biggest hurdle for Lyles to overcome. It is not his best race, and it's the one he took up shortly after Tokyo with the goal of becoming more than a mere sprinter, but a larger-than-life personality, both on and off the track.\n\nLyles also figures to feature prominently in the men's 4x100 relay but that's anything but a gimme.\n\nRiddled with poor work with the baton, a lack of consistent training habits, a doping positive and the constant spectre of trying to beat Bolt, the U.S. has not won, and kept, a single Olympic medal in this event since 2004. It hasn't captured gold since 2000.\n\nThe relay is a bigger threat to Lyles' quest to win three gold medals, the way Bolt did in all three of his appearances, than the 200 meters.\n\nLyles figures to get his biggest challenge in the 200 from Kenny Bednarek, who finished ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and, more recently, pushed him at a fast Olympic trails that Lyles won in 19.53.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tobogo, American Erryion Knighton and defending champion Andre De Grasse are also in the mix. One interesting wager would be whether Lyles has more of a chance of losing the race or lowering his American record of 19.31. Bolt's world record is 19.19.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Coe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Coe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2dbedf8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3097x1742+0+161/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F98%2F21%2Fd108656efb4a871826e8d256c514%2F091f83330c6946619591e73cf1708545", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Lyles was absolutely delighted with his triumph, with the American claiming his second Olympic medal after winning bronze in the 200m in Tokyo.\n\nLyles is the reigning world champion, having claimed gold in Budapest last year, and his triumph was documented in Netflix's 'SPRINT' series which has helped him become a huge name in the world of athletics.\n\nThe 27-year-old also won the 200m and was part of the victorious US 4x100m relay at the World Championships, the first man to complete the sprint treble since Usain Bolt, and he raised some eyebrows ahead of the Olympics by claiming he is \"ready to transcend the sport\".\n\n\"You have to have the mindset of a god to be able to think every time that you're going to win the race,\" Lyles said. \"Belief. That is what you have to have. I don't believe in idols. I believe in myself. My mentality is extremely strong. And if it's not, I'll train it to be.\n\n\"I'm ready to transcend the sport. The medals come first because without them, who's going to pay attention to you? Once you have the medals, then you get the times, and more and more people gain interest.\n\n\"Then you've got the whole floor. We have to push the narrative of track and field. We have to do more; we have to be presented to the world.\" Lyles will also be eyeing gold in the 200m, with his personal best time of 19.31 making him the third-fastest competitor of all-time.\n\nLyles' father Kevin is a former sprinter who won gold in the 4x400m relay at the 1995 World Championships, while his mother Keisha was also a standout track and field athlete at college. Younger brother Josephus is also a sprinter who turned professional alongside Noah in 2016 after the pair signed with Adidas.\n\nLyles began competing in track and field at the age of 12, having initially been a gymnast as a child, with the American inspired to make the switch alongside his brother after watching the 2012 Olympics in London.\n\nReflecting on the race, four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson told the BBC : \"The best 100m final I have seen bar none. It was so open, there were so many great athletes. It lived up to it, we had this amazing race where you could throw a blanket over the finishing line.\"\n\nOlympic silver medallist Steve Cram added: \"Lyles didn't even have a medal 10m out. He didn't have a hope of winning. He came fast, he came hard, and in the end, by the smallest of margins, he has taken the Olympic title. Beaten in the heats, beaten in the semi-final, but he's won the one that mattered most.\"\n\nFollow all the action on day 9 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Rasco/Sports Illustrated\n\nNoah Lyles has arrived. He came out with all the confidence and swagger of a gold medalist, and after a somewhat shaky set of qualification races, got himself to the final. Once there, he knew he could take home a gold, the first in his Olympic career.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy, though, it took a personal record for Lyles. The field was stacked with speedy competitors. The race lived up to the hype and the lengthy pre-race theatrics that appeared to bother some of the athletes. In the end, we got a photo finish.\n\nAnother photo came out after the race, shared by the World Athletics social media, that tells an awesome story.\n\nJust look how awesome this eight-frame edit is:\n\nIt's eight frames of the race, from the start to the finish, and it shows just how close the race was. Every glance down the various lanes tells a different story. Each horizontal look at the eight race stages it captures tells another. The most obvious story, of course, is Lyles, who came from behind after the worst reaction-time start in the race.\n\nThe best and worst were separated by 0.12 seconds, and Lyles and the silver medalist, Kishane Thompson, were separated by .005 seconds.\n\nLyles was in last place at the 40 meter mark, and just seventh by the time the race got to the halfway point. He jumped up to third by the 60-meter mark and second at the 90-meter mark. He did not lead until the 100th meter, the end of the race. Lyles is in lane seven in the image, and you can see him fighting back to ultimately secure the gold.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_782,h_439,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/Screenshot-2024-08-04-171351-7efc18254e45da09fd6d8ddbea7c55d5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Check his powerful message for you", "body": "United States sprinter Noah Lyles cemented his reputation as the fastest man in the world by clinching the gold medal in the 100-meter sprint at the 2024 Paris Olympics. His victory marked the first time a U.S. man has won this event since Justin Gatlin's triumph in 2004. Lyles edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a thrilling photo finish, with Lyles clocking a time of 9.784 seconds, just five thousandths of a second ahead of Thompson's 9.789 seconds. This win secured Lyles his first Olympic gold medal and his second Olympic medal overall.\n\nWhat makes Lyles' achievement even more remarkable is his battle with asthma, a condition that could have hindered his ability to compete at such a high level. Asthma affects the airways in the lungs, making breathing difficult, which is particularly challenging for an elite athlete.\n\nAfter his victory, Lyles took to social media to reflect on his journey and the obstacles he has overcome. \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and depression,\" Lyles shared on X (formerly known as Twitter). \"But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\"\n\nLyles has dealt with asthma since childhood, a condition that once led to him being homeschooled. \"Asthma definitely affects kind of everything I do in terms of health, physical fitness, and sometimes even emotional well-being,\" Lyles told CNN in 2020. \"If you're emotionally fatigued, that can bring your immune system down.\"\n\nTo manage his condition, Lyles takes several precautions, including washing his hands frequently, taking vitamin C, and drinking warm water with lemon. He also emphasizes the importance of maintaining high spirits to keep his immune system strong.\n\nLyles' journey with asthma began at a young age, leading to frequent hospital visits due to severe asthma attacks and a weakened immune system. \"From about three to four, all the way to about seven years old, I was dealing with asthma and asthma attacks seriously, like in the hospital maybe every third night; coughing fits, constantly sick because my immune system was weak,\" Lyles recalled.\n\nA tonsillectomy, a change in diet, and the unwavering support of his mother eventually allowed Lyles to attend public school, where he faced additional challenges such as ADD and dyslexia. \"Around second grade, I was diagnosed with ADD and dyslexia, which made standardized testing and even simple tasks like spelling tests extremely difficult,\" Lyles said.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Lyles has proven that with determination and resilience, one can overcome significant obstacles. His gold medal win at the Paris Olympics stands as a testament to his incredible spirit and dedication.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homeschooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standardized test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunodeficiency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112279135,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1647293,overlay-etpanache/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Lyles will also run in the 200m on Thursday, an event in which he's heavily favored to win Gold.\n\nMen's 100m final best bet: For Sunday, the best bet, based on Lyles' underwhelming showing on Saturday, is to take Thompson at -160 (FanDuel).\n\nSunday, August 4 Olympic Odds Roundup\n\nBelow is the schedule and the current odds (from FanDuel) in the other notable events taking place on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_everett@newsweek.com", "name": "Tyler Everett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Athletics_Championships_\u2013_Men's_hammer_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's hammer throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442480/lyles-track.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3f2e6378088c034a6d8a41268b1569a2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 410, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

First comes the vision. Then comes the pledge, almost as if he is trying to speak the vision into reality. Finally the delivery, the nuts and screws of cashing the cheques his words have already written for him. And in about the time it takes you to read this paragraph, he becomes the Olympic 100m champion.\n\nThe new undisputed king of men's sprinting is a kind of tortured genius, a manga and anime fan who likes painting his nails and his skateboards, who mentioned his therapist in his press conference, who understands better than most that the glory and the despair are basically two halves of a whole. Perhaps nothing captures this better than a final won by five-thousandths of a second, the breathtakingly cruel difference between Lyles and Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\nIt was one hell of a fight, which is just as well because there is nothing Lyles likes better. In a sport of pure air and clean straight lines, perhaps the simplest sport of all, Lyles thrives on the thrust of conflict, the fast-twitch muscles of competition and confrontation, the salt of his haters' tears and the salt of his own. Often it is said of athletes that the first yard is in their head. With Lyles, it is more accurate to say that the first yard is in his mouth.\n\nHe has, for example, insisted all season on calling himself the \"fastest man in the world\" even though Thompson has run what remains the fastest time this year; who calls out pretty much the entire NFL and NBA for having the temerity to call themselves world champions. Who described himself before the last Games as the three-time Olympic gold medallist and made it his phone screensaver, shortly before leaving Tokyo with a grand total of one bronze medal.\n\nWhat changed? Perhaps we discovered this a few seconds into the final. He had already been edged out by Oblique Seville of Jamaica in the semi-final and Louie Hinchliffe of Great Britain in his first-round heat.\n\nWhatever aura he still possessed from his clean sweep at the world championships in Budapest 12 months ago, let's just say it wasn't entirely evident 40 metres into the race, with Lyles dead last and Thompson ominously taking to the front.\n\nThompson is 23 and yet, until this still-warm Paris evening, remained something of an unknown quantity. A product of the famous MVP club in Kingston, his coach Stephen Francis has made a very conspicuous show of holding him back, keeping his talent under wraps like a Formula One prototype. After running 9.92sec in the heats of last year's national championships, Francis withdrew him before the final. At other times, he has ordered Thompson to ease up after 60 metres which - in hindsight - might not have been the greatest idea.\n\nBecause at around 50m, the point at which Thompson is usually springing the knees high and opening out into his devastating drive phase, something began to malfunction. His head began to sway from side to side, the arms hanging a little loosely. In the biggest race of his life, in his first major championship, in a moment of stress few of us can imagine, Thompson was wobbling.\n\nAnd perhaps this, ultimately, is where those five-thousandths of a second can be found. Lyles has seen things. He has known the pain of defeat, the numbness of depression, the sting of rejection, even humiliation, and come out the other side. More importantly, this is a technique tweaked and honed in miniaturised detail with his coach Lance Brauman, a mindset forged in long and often difficult therapy sessions.\n\nThe arm strokes were perfectly clean, the head in absolute stillness, and his mind presumably in a similar state. Lyles ate up those final few metres, and then the final few centimetres, some deep competitive urge that simply would not allow him to be beaten. A pregnant pause. The eyes of the world on a little blue screen. Then the verdict. A scream from Lyles, followed by a tear down the back straight, chased by dozens of photographers, the biggest athletic mismatch of the night.\n\nWhat happens next is anyone's guess. Men's 100m champions from Jesse Owens to Usain Bolt have always been required to represent something larger than themselves, to be not just a champion but a figurehead, a polestar, a physical ideal and a relentless personal brand upon which tickets, hospitality packages and household items can reliably be sold.\n\nThis was a task too far for the defending champion Marcell Jacobs. Perhaps it came a little soon for Thompson too, an athlete still discovering the outer limits of himself, and who will have learned so much.\n\nFor Lyles, on the other hand, this is the role he always dreamed for himself. Through the tainted and confusing post-Bolt years, the brief interregnums of Justin Gatlin and Kerley, Jacobs and Christian Coleman, athletics has been searching - not without a certain internal contradiction - for a successor to its freakish once-in-a-generation sprinting god.\n\nAnd as the achievement began to dawn on him, Lyles began to slow a little. He stopped leaping and gurning for the cameras. He looked up at the stands and for a few seconds he fell completely silent, with all the solemnity of a man who has kept a sacred promise.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob

it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

And last, the answer popped up.\n\nYes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The world's fastest man.\n\nJust not by very much.\n\nThe American showman edged Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds for gold, Thompson 9.789 second for silver.\n\nThe new champion, a 27-year-old from Florida, said that before he left for Paris, a member of his support team ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the 23-year-old Jamaican and said, \"I think you got the Olympics, dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nFred Kerley, another U.S. runner, came in third at 9.81.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" the bronze medalist said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything -- but it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first in he closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least the 1980 Moscow Games -- or maybe even ever.\n\nBack then, Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Cuba's Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first photo finish.\n\nThe 9.784 marked a personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee men's race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAP photo by David J. Phillip / U.S. sprinter Noah Lyles, in lane seven, wins the men's 100-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Sunday in Saint-Denis, France.\n\nOut of the pool\n\nNANTERRE, France -- The final night of swimming at the Paris Games stirred a wide range of emotions for an American team that no longer rules the world in the pool.\n\nA world record from Bobby Finke. Elation.\n\nA historic loss that reignited gripes about Chinese doping. Stunning.\n\nFinally, another world record for the women's 4x100-meter medley relay team to edge rival Australia for the top spot in the gold-medal table. Whew!\n\n\"Just an awesome way to cap off the meet,\" said Lilly King of the winning relay team, who joined her teammates in strolling around the deck holding up the stars and stripes as the crowd filed out of La Defense Arena.\n\nFinke set the standard in the men's 1,500 freestyle -- he touched in 14 minutes, 30.67 seconds to break the record of 14.31.02 set by China's Sun Yang at the 2012 London Games -- before the American women closed a thrilling nine days of swimming in style.\n\nThe U.S. finished with eight gold medals to top Australia, which won seven events. Still, it was the lowest victory total for the Americans in the pool since the 1988 Seoul Games, when they were beaten by a doping-tainted East German program.\n\nThis time, American swimmers finished with 28 medals overall, two shy of their total three years ago at the Tokyo Games. In all, 13 countries won at least one gold and 19 teams made the medal podium.\n\nAfter a bevy of disappointing performances by some of its biggest names, the U.S. team was very much aware of its gold battle with the Aussies.\n\n\"I knew Bobby had tied it up,\" King said. \"Bobby's swim was electric. That was amazing. He definitely got my energy going for the relay. I was pumped to hopefully assert that lead and get the gold.\"\n\nThat's just what she did.\n\nKing made up for a disappointing showing in individual events at her third and final Olympics by powering to the lead on the breaststroke segment. Then it was Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske bringing it home in 3:49.63 to break the record of 3:50.40 set by the U.S. at the 2019 world championship meet.\n\nRegan Smith led off in the backstroke leg, earning a relay gold for the second night in a row after starting her Olympic career with five silvers and a bronze.\n\nAustralia (3:53.11) won silver and China (3:53.23) took bronze.\n\nChina stunningly won gold in the men's 4x100 medley relay with a time of 3:27.46, ending the American run of dominance that stretched back to the introduction of that event at the 1960 Rome Games. The Americans were left with the silver in 3:28.01, with France taking bronze in 3:28.38.\n\nThe only time the U.S. didn't win gold in the event was in 1980, when it boycotted the Moscow Games.\n\nThe winning team in Paris included Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, both among the nearly two dozen swimmers who tested positive for a banned substance before the Tokyo Games but were allowed to compete. The result stirred more hard feelings from other nations that feel the Chinese might have gotten away with cheating.\n\nAP photo by Brynn Anderson / Lilly King swims the breaststroke for the U.S. in the women's 4x100-meter medley relay final at the Paris Olympics on Sunday in Nanterre, France.\n\nSame as always\n\nThe Americans continued their domination in women's basketball as they chase an eighth consecutive gold medal. The United States beat Germany 87-68 to extend its record winning streak to 58 consecutive games dating to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The team clinched the top seed in its pool as it moves into the quarterfinals.\n\nLee's latest prize\n\nAmerican gymnast Sunisa Lee picked up her third medal in Paris and the sixth of her Olympic career by grabbing bronze in the uneven bars, exactly where she finished in Tokyo three years ago. Lee was part of the gold-winning U.S. team Tuesday and two days later added a bronze in the all-around individual competition.", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Games where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024\n\nWritten by AFP and originally published on The 42 whose award-winning team produces original content that you won't find anywhere else: on GAA, League of Ireland, women's sport and boxing, as well as our game-changing rugby coverage, all with an Irish eye.

I went up to him after, while we were waiting, and I even said 'I think you've got that, good going,' and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it (his name) and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it.\n\n\"He was quite a few lanes down, he was in four, I was in seven so it was hard for me to picture where we were.\"\n\nThe American world 100m and 200m champion's triumph comes three summers after he entered the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the 200m favourite and world champion - but only claimed bronze.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about a lifelong battle with depression and the challenges of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform - ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nEarlier this week, he acknowledged he performs better in front of a full house, remembering the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself \"it's showtime\", but instead found himself thinking \"this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.\"\n\nLyles had no such trouble in Paris, where he thumped his chest at the start line and pumped up the electrified crowd, clearly revelling in the occasion, before they fell so quiet at the start of the race that it was possible to hear a plane passing overhead.\n\nThen the man whose weakness is often said to be his starts got off to the joint slowest, an 0.178 reaction time alongside Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nLyles, only learning that fact from a journalist, said: \"Slowest reaction time - that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nHe entered these Olympics with the third-fastest time at 100m this year behind Thompson's world-leading 9.77 and Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala's 9.79, and as a result found himself in a position of needing to back up his signature bravado on Sunday night.\n\nThompson qualified fastest of the semi-finalists in 9.80, his compatriot Seville Oblique just behind him in a personal-best 9.81 and Lyles two hundredths of a second behind.\n\nOblique was the only man who did not have to wait for his place to be confirmed - the last-placed man in 9.91.\n\nLyles is in Paris with a point to prove, embroiled in a debate before the Games about who was currently fastest man on the planet - not that he ever had any doubts.\n\nThe Floridian - who is looking to do the double in the 200 metres - emphatically reiterated his answer, this time with his feet instead of his rhetoric.\n\nGreat Britain's Louie Hinchliffe (left) and USA's Noah Lyles during the men's 100 metres semi-finals (Martin Rickett/PA).\n\nEarlier, Team GB sprinters Louie Hinchliffe and Zharnel Hughes saw their bid for Olympic 100m gold come to and end in the semi-finals.\n\nHinchliffe said: \"It was a good experience, not the result that I wanted. Definitely a lot to learn. I haven't seen the race back.\n\n\"I am disappointed. The time is OK but it's where I finished in the race. I will come back stronger next year. I will not regress. It's my first year on the scene. There is a lot more to come.\n\n\"Definitely, definitely LA, I will be there (in the final). Next year as well. There are a lot of world championships between then and now. There is a lot of time.\n\nHughes has another chance to try for a first Olympic medal when the men's 200m heats begin on Monday.\n\nHe said: \"I am a fighter. I am very determined and that's why I wanted to give it a go. I got the training in but the races is what I needed to get me race sharp.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silvio Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loverboy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loverboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allan Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Speedwagon", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "REO Speedwagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

While the broadcast never cut to the players in the stadium, some fans did spot them. They got to witness Lyles getting the win for the USA, securing the gold medal in the sprint.\n\nOne X user did point out that at the end of the race, when Lyles had secured the gold medal, Joel Embiid could be seen walking out of the stands, presumably to leave the stadium.\n\nLyles has been quite the controversial figure in basketball discourse over the last year or so. Lyles famously called out the NBA for calling their winners 'world champions', claiming that a winner of a national league cannot be considered world champions if they haven't defeated any international teams in the process.\n\nSeveral players responded to Lyles' comments, including Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Damian Lillard. Tyrese Haliburton actually went on to explain why the NBA calls winners 'world champions', as the NBA is the best basketball league in the world by some distance, and houses some of the best players all over the world.\n\nHowever, some players, like Giannis Antetokounmpo, actually agreed with what Lyles had to say. Despite the backlash, Lyles stood firm in his belief, especially as a track runner who competes on the world stage on a regular basis.\n\nThere is merit to both sides of this argument. In theory, Lyles is right because the NBA is a national league - the 'N' in NBA does stand for national, after all. But at the same time, the NBA is far and away the best league in the world, and the best team in the NBA can be considered world champions because they are the best team in the best league.\n\nNoah Lyles Is Public Enemy No.1 For Basketball Fans\n\nNoah Lyles made himself an enemy of ardent NBA fans with his comments, People were not happy with what he had to say about the league, and how dismissive he was about the 'world champions' title. While some of the discourse has been excessive, Lyles hasn't exactly warmed himself to fans.\n\nLyles even trolled Team USA last year, after their disastrous performance at the FIBA World Cup, where they finished fourth in the tournament after losses to Germany and Canada. It is clear that even after he made those comments, Lyles feels a type of way about the distinction of 'world champions'.\n\nUSA Basketball has a chance to get one-up Lyles in the Olympics, as they look to secure the gold medal for their country. After a perfect run so far, going 3-0 in their group-stage games, Team USA will face Brazil in the quarter-finals of the tournament.\n\nA win in that game sends them to the semi-finals, where they will play the winner of Serbia vs. Australia. Team USA will be confident about their chances against either team, as they defeated both teams in their showcase games in the lead-up to the Olympics, and even beat Serbia in their group stage opener.\n\nRelated: Team USA Spending $15 Million On 700 Rooms At Secret Luxury Hotel Outside Of Olympic Village\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

I would have loved to win today, but big up to the whole field.\"\n\nAmerican Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81 and Akani Simbini of South Africa was fourth, making it a remarkable six fourth or fifth-placed finishes in global championships, albeit with the consolation of a national record of 9.83.\n\nDefending champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, heavily strapped, finished fifth in 9.85 and Letsile Tebogo of Botswana also set a national record with 9.86 in sixth place.\n\nSuch was the quality of the race, that eighth-placed Oblique Seville of Jamaica still clocked 9.91 seconds.\n\nSeville had finished ahead of Lyles in 9.81 in the semi-final when the American looked to be at full stretch.\n\nHowever, the biggest showman in the sport and the star of the runaway success Netflix SPRINT series, has become a serious championship operator over the shorter distance, having won three 200m world titles and bronze over that distance at the last Olympics.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practice over the years',\" he said. \"It's accumulated to this point.\"\n\nLyles, 27, is targeting a possible four golds in Paris, in the 100m, his favourite 200m, the 4x100m relay and, possibly, the 4x400m relay.\n\nThat would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with long jump instead of the longer relay.\n\nFormer world champion Kerly ran an excellent race to add bronze to his Tokyo silver medal.\n\n\"That was a great race and anyone could have won it,\" he said. \"I feel that I executed as best as I could. I came here for the gold and nothing else but, hey, everybody came here for the same thing and only one can win.

I told him, 'I think you got that one'. I couldn't really see what was going on over there,\" he said as the world waited for the winner to be announced.\n\n\"I just had to keep running like I was going to win it. Something told me 'you need to lean'. This is how close first and second is going to be.\n\n\"It was a crazy moment. I did think that Kishane had that. I was like, 'I'm going to have to swallow my pride', which I don't have a problem doing.\n\n\"Everybody on the field came out knowing they could win this race. That's the mindset we have to have. Iron sharpens iron.\n\n\"I saw my name and was like, 'I didn't do this against a slow crowd, I did this against the best of the best, on the biggest stage with the biggest pressure'.\"\n\nLyles' whole career may boil down to that famous lunge for the line, but he says it's not something he has ever focused on.\n\n\"No, I do not practise dipping all that much,\" he said.\n\n\"I would say I have a decent history with dipping at the line. Throughout my high-school career and stuff like that, a lot of races have come down to dips. I've been able to win.\"\n\nBriefly, ever so briefly, Thompson thought the glory could be his.\n\n\"I couldn't see him, but I thought he was seeing me,\" Thompson said of Lyles.\n\n\"He said, 'Hey Kishane I thought you got it,' and I said, 'I am not sure'.\n\n\"This is the closest medal.\"\n\nIt was almost cruel for Thompson to be asked if the medal should be shared between them.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offence to any other sport.

Justin Gatlin was the last sprinter, man or woman, to win Olympic 100m gold.\n\nWorld Athletics president Sebastian Coe has dubbed Lyles, whose contract renewal with Adidas this season was described as the biggest since Bolt's with Puma, an \"absolute rock star\".\n\nDread-locked rapper more than rock star, the 27-year-old American's efforts in the Hungarian capital were captured in Netflix's docuseries entitled \"Sprint\".\n\nA second season is being filmed with the Paris Games as the backdrop. The cameras firmly shine the spotlight on the self-assured Lyles, who looks more than ready to bring track back into the wider public consciousness and whose brashness was clear for all to hear in a litany of quotable soundbites in the first series.\n\n'WORLD CHAMPION' DEBATE IGNITED\n\n\"You have to have the mindset of a god,\" Lyles said of being a top sprinter in \"Sprint\".\n\n\"I'm a true believer in that the moment isn't bigger than me, the moment was made for me.\" While many pundits insist that such an outlook is hardly rare for elite athletes, there is no doubt his brazen approach rubs many other people up the wrong way, not least legions of NBA basketball players -- and their fans -- after Lyles had questioned their claim to be real \"world champions\".\n\nLyles made some inflammatory remarks during the World Athletics Championships when asked about he state of athletics on a global scale.\n\n\"You know the thing that hurts me the most?\" he began. \"I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their heads.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong. I love the US at times. But that ain't the world. That is not the world - we are the world.\n\n\"We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving and putting on a flag to show that they are represented.\n\n\"There ain't no flags in the NBA. We got to do more. We got to be presented to the world.\n\n\"I love the track community, but we can only do so much within our own bubble. There's a whole world out there.\"\n\nThe comments did not go down well with the NBA community, with many players -- including Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard and Aaron Gordon -- hitting back hard.\n\nLyles may well have been setting himself up for more vitriol had he not saluted on his 100m favouritsm -- with some on social media turning on him over an underwhelming heats performance. However he got the job done -- albiet by 0.005 seconds -- and New York Knicks star Josh Hart tweeted Lyles could now \"talk for life\".\n\nLyles, who has openly talked about his struggles with mental health and depression in recent years, admits that his growing fame has become a problem in the Olympic Village.\n\n\"I've become kind of popular in the village and unfortunately that has come with its own set of challenges in being able to find my own space within the village, whether that's eating or training in the gym,\" he said.\n\nHis gold in Paris at least atones for his disappointing Tokyo experience, where he came away with a bronze in the 200m.\n\n\"That bronze still burns a hole in my chest,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"I will be carrying it around during Paris just to remind me that this is not the colour we are coming back with.\" Lyles, who suffered from chronic asthma as a child, insisted he thrives under public scrutiny.\n\n\"The more eyes on me, the better I perform, or at least that's what my therapist says. When the TV cameras are on me and people are there, I am not losing.\" The American is still hoping to complete an audacious bid for medals in four events in Paris, adding the 4x400m relay to his repertoire.\n\nHe ruffled feathers in the world indoors in Glasgow in March when, after claiming 60m silver behind teammate Christian Coleman, he was selected for the 4x400m relay squad that also won silver.\n\nIt was a call-up that left the US federation accused of favouritism. \"Let's just say a lot of people in the US were very, very, very upset that I ran the 4x400 and to that I would say, 'run faster, push me out!',\" Lyles said.\n\nBolt retired from the sport in 2017 having won 11 world and eight Olympic golds. Lyles, whose Budapest sprint double was the first since Bolt's at the Beijing worlds in 2015, said: \"Usain Bolt has done it and him saying to me that he sees what I am doing and he respects it, it is amazing.\n\n\"I am the guy who wants to move past being track-famous. I want people to see me on the track, but in GQ and my docu-series, and realise I'm a cool guy too.\n\n\"Medals are the first step because then people pay attention to you. \"Then you can go into different directions: fashion, music. You can start collaborating with other people, artists and the world.\"\n\nLyles arrived in Paris knowing full well that he needed to continue his fine form, simply because to continue garnering attention, he needs to keep winning medals -- the Olympics are the ultimate global championships for the American spectator.\n\nThat was Bolt's allure: his ability to dominate and win multiple gold medals at global championships.\n\nLyles has bagged one -- a real one.

But Lyles was five one thousands of a second faster, according to the official review.\n\nHe's an Olympic gold medalist in the 100m dash.\n\nThe race is one of the coolest in the history of the Summer Games. It doesn't get much closer than this.\n\n\"NOAH LYLES' OLYMPIC DREAM COMES TRUE! 100M GOLD MEDALIST,\" NBC wrote.\n\nLyles' Summer Games aren't over, either.\n\nThe American sprinter is expected to contend for the gold medal in the men's 200m dash later in the Summer Games. That race is set to occur on Thursday at 2:30 p.m. E.T. and it'll air live on NBC.\n\nBut for now, the United States can celebrate Lyles' win in the 100m dash. It's America's first win in the men's 100m dash at the Summer Olympics since Justin Gatlin in Athens in 2004.\n\nRelated: U.S. Track Star Noah Lyles Is Dating A Fellow Olympian", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_holleran@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Holleran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

I know that in a lot of races he's been one or two lanes away from me and he's been able to be get out just in that acceleration phase and I've just been missing it. I was like, 'nah, now that you're right next to me I'll make sure I cover that'.\n\n'And then after I passed him I saw Kishane out there I was like just do what I do, hit my top-end speed, let it work.\n\n'To be honest, I didn't know if I had it. I leaned but I didn't know I had it.\n\n'Me and Kishane were at the end waiting for our names to come up and I came back and I said, 'I'll be honest, man, I think you got that one'.\n\n'But my name came up and I was like, 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\n\n'I've waited a long time, I've seen Jamaican's dominate the 100m and 200m for so long and I remember growing up saying, 'when it's my turn I'm going to make sure that the US is on top'. And here it is, here's my time, my journey, my moment, it's such a beautiful thing to see.'\n\nIn a separate interview with the BBC, Lyles admitted he was frustrated with his performance in the semi final earlier on Sunday evening after he finished second behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville.\n\n'A guy in biomechanics comes down and before I came out here, he said it was going to be this much, that's how close it is going to be and gosh was he right,' Lyles said.\n\n'I had to take every round as it was and I was a little upset after the first round so I came with the aggression and after I ran that 83 and I was done with the aggression.\n\n'My sports therapist told me you need to let go, you're holding on.

Making a sluggish start, the American clocked at 10.04 seconds and was behind Louie Hinchliffe, the British sprinter coached by Carl Lewis. Flashing his Team USA-themed nail polish and making signs like an elite WWE superstar, Lyles was nothing but a crowd-puller in the semi-finals of the 100m event at the Paris Games.\n\nALSO READ: Catch HT's comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics here\n\nDespite the massive hype, the 27-year-old capped off his second-sluggish start as the US sprinter finished behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the semi-finals. Two months before the Games, sprinter Seville stared down Lyles at the Racers Grand Prix. Seville again gave Lyles a death stare in the semi-finals of the Paris Olympics. What happened in the final after the showdown between the two sprinters is history.\n\nLyles emerged victorious in the closest-ever Olympic 100-metre final by five-thousandths of a second. In a photo finish, Lyles eclipsed Jamaica's Kishane Thompson with a personal best of 9.79 seconds -- the same timing as the Jamaican, only separated by the width of a vest. Interestingly, Lyles clocked at 9.784sec to Thompson's 9.789sec, although both sprinters were listed as 9.79sec after the nerve-shredding summit clash. American Fred Kerley bagged bronze in 9.81, and South Africa's Akani Simbini finished fourth in the final standings.\n\nWhat separated the gold and silver medallists in the men's 100 final at the Paris Games? World champion Lyles timed his dip to perfection to upstage Thompson by the barest of margins. If the dash had been 99 metres, Thompson would have sealed Jamaica's fourth 100m win in five Olympics. The men's 100m final was the blue-riband event at the Olympics during the Usian Bolt era.\n\nDubbed the undisputed sprint king, Bolt finished his career with eight Olympic gold medals -- one was later revoked as Nesta Carter was found guilty of doping. Bolt holds the world records for the 100m and 200m events. The celebrated sprinter shattered the world record by winning the 100m event at the Beijing Olympics. Bolt earned three gold medals (100m, 200m, and 4x100m) at the London 2012 Games and three at the Rio 2016 Games.\n\nThe invincible sprinter claimed his third straight Olympic 100m gold at the Rio Games. Bolt's 100m Olympic record (9.63 seconds) at the London 2012 Olympics is still untouched, and the sprint legend also holds the world record of 9.58, which he set back in 2009. USA's Lyles is eyeing to become the first sprinter to win both the 100m and 200m events at the Olympics since Bolt. Will Bolt's Colosseum capture another photo finish in Paris? Only time will tell.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type":

The others were getting ready and trying to calm their beating hearts. Noah Lyles was just flailing his arms to get the crowd going.\n\nThe problem with such an entry - one that transcends anything we've ever seen from the ultimate theatrical maestro Usain Bolt - is the potential for arrogance.\n\nLyles has been praising himself for so long that he has built a tower of pressure on himself that stretches all the way to the Parisian night sky. And for a long time, by the standards of this race of all races, it looked like it was going to come crashing down on his head.\n\nTen metres into this extraordinary Olympic final, he was last. Forty metres into it, he was last. And then, with the start that had always been his weakness, he rose like a gladiator, past two brilliant, unsuspecting Jamaicans who believed they could restore Bolt's spirit, to win the greatest, closest men's 100m final of them all.\n\nSome thought he had shown a genius by picking up the tape, although he himself did not find it that difficult. \"I thought I was leaning too late,\" he said. \"I don't practice dipping that much.\"\n\nNoah Lyles won gold in the best ever men's 100m final at the Olympics as he responded fantastically\n\nLyles won by five thousandths of a second to capture his first Olympic gold medal\n\nThe American star was full of confidence before the race and he managed to secure the glory\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nFor 15 enormous seconds, Lyles didn't know he had won and in the mist of uncertainty he was silenced for the first time. He simply stood on the shoulder of Kishane Thompson, the Jamaican who had seemingly won this, staring at the stadium screen as a seven-way photo finish ensued. And then it was confirmed.\n\nHe had won by five thousandths of a second in a time of 9.784. Only 0.012 of a second separated the eight who raced. Michael Johnson had predicted it would be 'the most open in 15 years'. And then some.\n\nIt is the 27-year-old's first Olympic gold. It is the United States' first Olympic gold on the queen's distance since Justin Gatlin in Athens in 2004.\n\nDon't be fooled by the pomp and circumstance of \"The Big Noise,\" as Lyles was recently dubbed on the cover of a magazine, or by the tattoo on his abs that reads \"icon,\" which he says reminds him of \"what I want to be known for when I die.\"\n\nBecause sports is a brutal equalizer. It only perpetuates winners. No one cares about your red-and-black painted nails and your rap playlist if you're not a winner. And everything about track and field is a precursor to this Sunday night, every four years. This race transcends everything.\n\nThat's why the bronze medal in the 200 meters that Lyles took home from Tokyo, where he wasn't even on the U.S. team, was such a disappointment to him.\n\nHe has carried that bronze with him everywhere he has raced as a memento of his failure, as he sees it, and he even showed it off at his press conference late last night. He had been battling demons before Tokyo and had come off antidepressants to get in shape.\n\nHe knew there were chinks in his own armor. Like Bolt, he's never been an exciting starter at this distance, despite all the work his coach Lance Brauman has done with him. He's been behind in his three 100m races here. There were delays on the track as they tried to get the house lights back on after the pre-race light show. A protester was escorted off the track.\n\nAfter ten meters of this extraordinary Olympic final he was last, but Lyles managed to win\n\nKishane Thompson looked to have won the race, but ultimately had to settle for silver\n\nTeam GB's Zharnel Hughes disappeared from view after finishing sixth in the third semi-final\n\nLouie Hinchliffe became the first athlete in Olympic history to fail to reach the final with a speed of less than ten seconds\n\nThe only clue Lyles gave about how he found grace under pressure as the race seemed to accelerate away from him came from advice his therapist had given him. \"You have to relax. Let go. Be yourself.\"\n\nIn reality, Outrageous Belief brought him home. This is a man who holds to a mindset that only the best athletes have, where losing doesn't seem like the remotest possibility. It also helped that he was in lane 7, away from the center. \"I couldn't really see what was going on out there.\"\n\nWhat a contrast to the fate of the Britons, mere mortals, who had competed in the semi-finals. Sheffield runner Louie Hincliffe, who had pushed Lyles into second place in the first round of the 100m, became the first athlete in Olympic history to fail to reach the final with a speed of less than ten seconds. Zharnel Hughes was eliminated after finishing sixth in the third semi-final, with a time of 10.01.\n\nThe final produced the best possible outcome for track and field. Lyles and his outsized ego can draw attention and money to a sport that needs them both, as Bolt and Johnson once did. The sport needs its egos.\n\nLyles declared last night, without any irony, that he now wants his own shoe. 'Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker.'\n\nHe's not done yet. He wants gold in the 200m, the 4x100m and the 4x400m and the description of the moment he saw he had won the race tells us he won't be lacking in confidence. 'When I saw my name pop up,' he said. 'I thought, \"Oh my God, I'm unbelievable.\"'", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thompson had run impressive times in the heats and semi-finals, leaving many fans convinced he was the favourite.\n\nThe naked eye shows the Jamaican sprinter reached the line first, but after what looked like an extremely long wait, Lyles was awarded the win, sparking emotional celebrations.\n\nSo, how did Lyles win? Legit.ng explains.\n\nFirst of all, and for context, it is important to note that, save for the finishing line, Lyles did not lead the race at any point. In fact, at the 30-metre mark, he was the last one of the eight athletes. He rose to third at the 70-metre mark behind Thompson and eventual bronze medalist Fred Kerley.\n\nWith 10 metres to go, the world champion from Budapest was second to Thompson in another remarkable exhibition of his top-end speed. They crossed the line at the same time and were made to wait to see who had won.\n\nEnter technology.\n\nIn such tight cases, World Athletics employs the Total Athletics Operating System thanks to its partnership with Seiko, a watch company.\n\nThe technology measures athletes' times to the +/ -- 1/10,000th of a second by examining things like starting, timing, photo finish, wind measurement, and electronic distance measurement.\n\nThe photo-finish rule was used in the men's 100m final where \"a \"slit-video\" system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line -- scans it 2,000 times per second, providing an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line,\" as captured on World Athletics website.\n\nNow, and this is perhaps the most important part, Thompson appeared to cross the line first, but Lyles led with his torso, which is the body part used to determine the winner.\n\n\"The winner of the race is the athlete whose torso crosses the finish line first. Any other body parts that may cross before the torso, such as head, hands and feet, will not count.\"\n\nAs the debate rages on, Lyles will revel in his new status as an Olympic gold medalist. he might still leave Paris with the three he desires, but getting one in his 'weak' 100m was the hardest.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_moses@legit.ng", "name": "Martin Moses", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.legit.ng/images/1200x675/588b9edca420d356.jpeg?v=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 174, "textEnd": 182}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

The others readied themselves and tried to still their beating hearts. Noah Lyles just twirled his arms around, whipping up the audience.\n\nThe problem with an entry like that -- an entry transcending anything we had even seen from the master of theatre Usain Bolt -- is the potential for hubris.\n\nLyles has been talking himself up for so long that he had built a tower of pressure on himself, stretching up to the blue Paris sky. And for a very long time, by the standards of this race of all races, it seemed to be crashing right down on his head.\n\nAfter 10 metres of this extraordinary Olympic final, he was last. After 30 metres he was last. And then, when the start which has always been his weakness was in the past, he rose like a gladiator, powering beyond two brilliant, unsuspecting Jamaicans who believed that they could restore the spirit of Bolt, to win the greatest, closest 100 metres men's final of them all.\n\nFor 20 enormous seconds, Lyles didn't know that fact. He was silenced for once. He just stood on the shoulder of Kishane Thompson, the Jamaican who seemed to have this won, staring at the stadium screen as a seven-way photo finish ensued.\n\nNoah Lyles won gold in the greatest men's Olympic 100m final ever as he responded superbly\n\nLyles won by five thousandths of a second as he managed to claim his first Olympic gold\n\nThe USA star was full of confidence before the race and he managed to secure glory\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nAnd then it was confirmed. In the stadium where Lyles made his 100m debut two years ago, and won, he won by five-thousandths of a second. Just 0.12 seconds divided the eight who raced. Michael Johnson had predicted it would be 'the most open in 15 years'. And some.\n\nIt is the 27-year-old's first Olympic gold. It is the United States' first Olympic gold over the queen distance since Justin Gatlin's at Athens in 2004.\n\nDon't be entirely deceived by the Lyles pomp and ceremony. The 'big noise' as one of the magazine covers describes his self-promotion, or the tattoo on his abs stating 'icon', which he says reminds him of 'what I want to be known for when I die.'\n\nBecause sport is a brutal leveller. It only sustains winners. No one cares about your red and black lacquered nails and your rap playlist when you're not a winner. And everything in athletics is a prelude to this Sunday night, every four years. This race transcends all else.\n\nIt's why the 200m bronze medal Lyles took home from Tokyo was a source of devastation to him. He'd struggled with demons before that summer, weaning himself off anti-depressants in an attempt to get himself in shape.\n\nBehind that monumental ego, he knew there were chinks in his armour. Like Bolt, he has never been an electrifying starter at this distance, for all the work that his coach Lance Brauman has done with him. He trailed in all three races which have delivered this gold.\n\nBut his belief saw him home. 'Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I want to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them. I'm the wolf among wolves.'\n\nWhat a contrast this provided to the Britons who had competed in the semi-finals.\n\nAfter ten metres of this extraordinary Olympic final, he was last but Lyles managed to win\n\nKishane Thompson looked to have won the race but ended up having to settle for silver\n\nTeam GB's Zharnel Hughes vanished from the picture after finishing sixth in third semi-final\n\nLouie Hinchliffe became the first athlete in the Olympic history not to make the final with a sub ten-second speed\n\nBuoyed by the experience of pushing Lyles into second place in the first round and performing close to the limit of his best in the semi-final, Sheffield runner Louie Hinchcliffe could not make the greatest race. Hinchliffe became the first athlete in Olympic history not to make the final with a sub ten-second speed, finishing third in a time of 9.97 -- two-hundredths of a second off his personal best -- but still didn't make the final. It was a sign of what a night of speed this was going to be.\n\n'Maybe I should have been more relaxed,' Hinchcliffe said. 'I was a bit tense at the end.'\n\nIt didn't augur well for Zharnel Hughes, the Briton who won a semi-final in Tokyo and reached the final there. Hughes hadn't broken ten seconds all season and vanished from the picture after finishing sixth in the third semi-final, finishing in 10.01.\n\nThey picked purple for this beautiful, vast Olympic track as a reference to the lavender fields of the south of France and Lyles has the scent of much more than this. His race in Paris.\n\nHe covets gold at 200m, his bolthole and the 'wife' to his 'mistress' the 100m, as he likes to call it.\n\nAnd perhaps the 4x100m and 4x400m -- a harvest which would place him among the giants, Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, crowned four times in 1936 and 1984.\n\nHis description of the moment he saw he had won this race tells us that he won't lack in confidence. 'To see my name pop,' he said.

That was the margin between the American Noah Lyles and the Jamaican Kishane Thompson, who both crossed the line in 9.79sec. After a long wait, and plenty of racing hearts. Lyles was declared the winner.\n\nAnother American, Fred Kerley, took bronze in 9.81, with the South African Akani Simbine fourth.\n\nWhen Lyles won the world 200m title in 2022 he set his sights on a daring new goal: becoming a global star and influencer. It sounded like a preposterous dream. But then he won three gold medals at the 2023 world championships in Budapest. And, with the Netflix cameras and boom mics in tow, he also emerged as the co-star of the docu-series Sprint. Now, after this, everything is on the table for him.\n\nLyles had been last after 15 metres, his start less explosive than his main rivals. But over the last few metres he closed on Thompson in front of him before getting the dip on the line.\n\nWhen Netflix made Sprint, which has brought the adrenalised thrills of the 100 metres to an entire new audience, it never even bothered to speak to either Thompson or Oblique Seville. Instead most of its focus was directed at those with a star spangled banner on their vest, including Lyles and Kerley.\n\nIt meant that when the sprinters were introduced to the 75,000 crowd at the Stade du France with a dazzling show and the soundtrack of Kavinsky, Lyles and Kerly were given the biggest cheers.\n\nAs they were introduced, Thompson roared like the king of the jungle, while Kerley put his fingers to his lips. Lyles, meanwhile, bounded halfway down the track, hollering in excitement.\n\nNormally the sprinters do not have to wait long to start after that. Instead they were kept an age standing on the blocks, as the crowd clapped and the more music started playing. Perhaps that explained why they all seemed to run tight, and the times were less quick than had been expected.\n\nEarlier Britain's two representatives in 100m semi-finals, Louie Hinchliffe and Zharnel Hughes, both failed to qualify. The 21-year-old Hinchliffe has had an incredible season, which has seen him win the prestigious NCAA title. However he just missed out after coming third in his semi-final in 9.97.\n\n\"It was a good experience, not the result that I wanted,\" he said. \"Definitely a lot to learn. I haven't seen the race back. Maybe I should have been more relaxed. I was a bit tense at the end.\n\n\"There were a lot of mistakes. I should have been more relaxed going into it. It's not the result that I wanted. I will come back stronger next year. I will not regress. It's my first year on the scene. There is a lot more to come.\"\n\nHughes, meanwhile, admitted that a hamstring injury in early June had affected his preparations after finishing sixth in 10.01 in his semi-final.\n\n\"There is not much to assess,\" he said. \"I just didn't make it. I am disappointed. I gave it my best. You all know I had a hamstring injury. It is not the easiest thing to come back from. Especially what I had, a grade two on the outside of the right hamstring.\n\n\"If we had more races, you know that I am a better performer than this. Last year I ended with 9.88 on the podium and with a bronze. It kind of sucks, being injured last minute just before the Olympics. But I am a fighter. I am very determined and that's why I wanted to give it a go. I got the training in but the races is what I needed to get me race sharp.\n\n\"I rarely miss out on finals,\" added Hughes, who won a 100m world championship bronze medal last year. \"So this one is a bit hard to swallow. The road sometimes can be rocky. There are days that you guys don't see the work behind the scenes and injuries that come along. We try to give our best. Today I gave it my best.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zharnel_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zharnel Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavinsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kavinsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/21926730a2f0ec099a61e5dc23ca1f51", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. track & field athlete, who secured a bronze last Olympics in the 200m, won gold in the 100m on Sunday in Paris. He set a personal best of 9.79, beating the silver medalist Kishane Thompson by just five thousandths of a second.\n\nHis personal best in the event was a 9.81, which he posted at the London Athletics Meet in July. At team trials, he posted a 9.83 before the Olympics in late June.\n\nLyles ran a 10.04 in his quarterfinal heat, sandwiched between Louie Hinchliffe (Great Britain) who put up a 9.98 and Shaun Maswanganyi (South Africa) who put up a 10.06. He admitted after that heat that he was a little stunned by how much his fellow competitors brought their A-game.\n\n\"That's my first lesson in underestimating the power of the Olympics. When somebody's on the line, they're going to give it their all or nothing. But now I don't have to hold back. I'm ready to go.\"\n\nIn his semifinal heat, Lyles secured one of the two automatic-in slots in his heat with a 9.83, second in his heat to Oblique Seville (Jamaica), who put up a 9.81. Of the eight runners that qualified, two (Seville and Kishane Thompson, also of Jamaica) put up better quarterfinal times than him.\n\nLyles is not done at the Paris games.

Find out why we are backing Oblique Sevile to reach the podium on Sunday afternoon.\n\nNothing compares to the anticipation and heart-pounding action of the 100m, and we've got a stacked field of contenders for this marquee Sunday race.\n\nNoah Lyles believes that no one can beat Noah Lyles, as he might say, but the reality is that the men's field includes a handful of runners with personal bests of 9.82 or faster.\n\nJoin me as I break down the race and give my best Olympic Men's 100m Final prediction below.\n\nMy analysis\n\nThe 100m final has been billed as a head-to-head battle between Kishane Thompson and Noah Lyles -- and Lyles' underwhelming performance in the first heat significantly shortened the odds on Thompson racing away with the gold medal.\n\nI like Thompson as the 100m champion, but I'm looking elsewhere for my best bet, with a wide-open chasing pack dreaming of their moment.\n\nOblique Seville is flying a little under the radar with Thompson leapfrogging him as the Jamaican sprint king, but he's a proven threat and he's got the GOAT Usain Bolt in his corner as well as highly touted coach Glen Mills.\n\nSeville just missed out on the podium at the World Championships in 2021 and 2023, but he ran an impressive 9.82 in the Jamaican trials, finishing second to Thompson.\n\nHe posted that same time as he won the Racers Grand Prix in Kingston on June 1, pushing Lyles into second place and making his case as a podium contender. Write him off at your peril.\n\nSeville was in a good rhythm as he ran 9.99 in the first round on Saturday in Paris, and he's a man to watch heading into the business end of this event.\n\nThere's more left in the tank for the 23-year-old and, while the spotlight may not be shining as brightly on him, Seville only has to finish in the top three to cash in this prop. His recent times suggest that's well within reach, and he'll surely believe he can crash the party for gold or silver.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a stacked field with very little margin for error.

His career-best performance ensured that he finished 0.005 seconds ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson to win the 100-meter Olympic title.\n\nAside from earning the gold medal, the American returned the accolade to the United States 20 years after Justin Gatlin won it at the 2004 Athens Olympics.\n\nFred Kerley took bronze with a 9.81, and Team USA's double podium was an amazing moment for Americans all over the world who dedicated their time and attention to the competition, as reported by Track & Field Gazette on X.\n\nThe 100-meter grid for the finals was confirmed following the semi-final heat 3, which included the top eight athletes with the fastest timings across all heats. Everyone on the track had an impressive resume, but they were all vying for the dazzling gold medal, which was being defended by Lamont Marcell Jacobs.\n\nKerley had the fastest response time when the race started, but the American was quickly overtaken by Thompson, who claimed the lead. The Jamaican prodigy maintained his form, but as they approached the final few meters of the race, everyone in the front row was uncomfortably close to one another.\n\nHowever, the fans at the Stade de France witnessed both the Jamaican prodigy and the six-time world champion cross the finish line in the exact same time, 9.79 seconds.\n\nBoth athletes were watching the huge screen, waiting for the final verdict, and Lyles defeated his young Jamaican rival by five-thousandths of a second to become the 100-meter Olympic champion.\n\nEmotions were running high for the Olympic gold medalist, who redeemed himself for his bronze medal finish at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. This accomplishment was a significant milestone in Lyles' excellent athletic career, but his focus had already switched entirely to the 200-meter sprint.\n\nNoah Lyles has already silenced many skeptics and naysayers who questioned his performance in the 100-meter Olympic event. However, his objectives at the Paris Olympics are far from finished, as the athlete has set his sights on the 200-meter sprint.\n\nThe heats for the category begin in a few hours, and he will compete in Heat 6. The 27-year-old is already a favorite in the 200 meters, but he understands that his major goal of winning gold medals in all categories in which he competes is still a work in progress.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/86d3eeb9-noah-lyles-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

A crucial phone call with his therapist after a tense semi-final round was instrumental in his victory.\n\nLyles delivered a stellar performance, winning the 100 meters gold by a mere five-thousandths of a second with a time of 9.79 seconds. The final was intensely competitive, with Jamaican sprinter Oblique Seville finishing last despite clocking 9.91 seconds. In the semi-final, Seville had outpaced Lyles, necessitating a shift in mindset for Lyles ahead of the final.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: India Schedule | Full Coverage | Medal Tally\n\nSpeaking after the win, as quoted by Reuters, Lyles detailed how he had a call with his therapist who told him to let go, relax and be himself in the final race.\n\n\"I wouldn't say nervous - I'd say I was extremely curious as to what was going to happen. That's how me and my therapist phrase it. I'm curious as to what I'm going to do, how am I going to pull this off,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"I came in third-fastest from the semis. I'm like 'This is going to be serious, this is not going to be easy'. And I had said OK, my therapist said 'You need to let go, you need to relax and you need to be yourself'.\"\n\nThe U.S. sprinter, who has openly shared his mental health journey, knew the importance of being mentally prepared. Lyles' familiarity with the highs and lows of his sport stems from a personal journey of overcoming depression, a struggle he faced three years ago. The three-time 200m world champion's journey hit a low point in 2021 when he failed to qualify for the 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials. Determined to become the fastest man on earth, he focused on rebuilding both his body and mind.\n\nThis victory in Paris marks the culmination of Lyles' relentless effort and dedication to his mental and physical well-being, underscoring the importance of mental health in achieving athletic excellence.\n\n\"I did this against the best of the best, on the biggest stage, with the biggest pressure,\" Lyles said. \"And I wasn't even entered in the 100 in 2021. You know, here I am, first Olympics in the 100, going around now the Olympic champion.\"\n\nLyles will now be in action in the 200 m event as he bids to complete a rare sprint double at the Olympics.

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTom and Molly Bedell's West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M Sierra signage going up at former Sioux City Bed Bath & Beyond 'We'll miss the place': Home on Sioux City's north side on market for first time in decades A shellfish guest: Chesapeake blue crab found at Sioux City Library Sioux City's original guitar hero to be celebrated with a three-night musical extravaganza A favorite Sioux City deli stages a comeback with a new lobby and full menu of sandwiches Olympic Athletics Results: USD's Chris Nilsen finishes 11th in pole vault group Elk Point man killed in North Sioux City crash Body found in Floyd River in Sioux City Police release name of man pulled from Floyd River Simon Max Kaplan Toast on Hill offering classy breakfast and lunch to Okoboji Lakes visitors 'Exhausting, heartbreaking, devastating': Racism at Wayne school pushes family out of Nebraska Five rescued after tree falls on Sioux City home; wind storm knocks out power, causes outages New Woodbury jail expected to be complete second week in August\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man.

Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

See you in Paris @ObliqueSeville,\" he wrote.\n\nWith the open call-out, a rivalry was established with Lyles was under the obligation to deliver on his promise by getting an act of revenge against the Jamaican speedster.\n\nThe 100m semifinals in Paris will be their first clash since their last viral moment. This time, Seville had the edge again blazing to a new PB of 9.81s to Lyles's 9.83s, with both incidentally doing the same gesture to each other crossing the finish line to make the final.\n\nConsequently, when it mattered most competing for the ultimate price, Lyles surpassed all expectations and proved why he will always be the man to beat, as he produced his best career performance for victory to win USA's first men's Olympic 100m title in 20 years since Justin Gatlin.\n\nThe American speedster saved his best 100m race for the last, storming to the finish line in a new PB of 9.79s for his first Olympic gold medal ahead of Kishane Thompson in an identical time. However, Lyles had the edge by a reaction of 0.005.\n\nFred Kerley resurfaced on why he's a former world champion by claiming the bronze medal in 9.81s. Meanwhile, Seville couldn't replicate his best season's performances, dropping dead last in 9.91s.\n\nLyles backed up his promise with an astounding victory and come what may, the American track star will surely be in the limelight as always the man to beat for many years coming.", "source": {"uri": "pulsesports.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse Sports Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_abbreviations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletics abbreviations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://sportal365images.com/process/smp-images-production/ringier.africa/05082024/0a5eba36-6bf7-4a88-b24f-cedad226800f.jpg?operations=fit(1200:630)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

He was ready for this moment.", "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France -- Eight of the fastest men in the world got ready to line up. The time between athlete introductions and when the gun sounded felt equivalent to the length of a Super Bowl halftime show. The pressure of the moment intensified throughout the Stade de France. When the gun went off, Noah Lyles illustrated in 9.79 (.784) seconds that he's the fastest man in the world -- and the most equipped to handle the moment.\n\n\"Everybody on the field came out knowing they could win this race. That's the mindset we have to have,\" Lyles said after winning the Olympic 100 final. \"Iron sharpens iron. I saw my name and was like, 'I didn't do this against a slow crowd, I did this against the best of the best, on the biggest stage, with the biggest pressure.'\n\n\"I wasn't even in the 100 in 2021. First Olympics in the 100. Having the title, not just at world champs but at the Olympics, of world's fastest man.\"\n\nLyles is not only fast, he's psychologically strong and confident.\n\nThe painted nails, the pearls around his neck or braided into his hair, the demonstrative introductions and \"fastest man in the world\" declarations -- Lyles is unapologetically himself. He's the ultimate showman. The best showman in track and field since Usain Bolt.\n\nHe talks the talk and walks the walk.\n\n\"It feels good to back it up. I've done a lot of work throughout the last three years since 2021, and even in 2021. I took on a lot of sponsors to get my name out there. I've seen tons of scenarios where athletes come in as a favorite and it doesn't work out for them,\" Lyles said. \"Knowing it can happen continues to fuel me. Constantly going that extra step, knowing that any time, somebody could pop up. People were saying it's going to be a slow year in the 100. It wasn't no slow year in the 100.\"\n\nLyles told USA TODAY Sports that the disappointment of only earning a bronze medal in the 200 at the Tokyo Olympics \"ignited a fire\" within him. He was experiencing depression in the lead-up to the Tokyo Games. He's since kept multiple therapists and is very forthright about how therapy continues to aid him. He spoke to one of his therapists before the 100.\n\n\"My therapist said, 'You need to let go, be yourself.' It was the energy that I'm looking for,\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles understood the direction and went out and executed. He's done so since being awarded a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, with four world championship golds since. Now he's an Olympic gold medalist for the first time. The fastest man in the world.\n\n\"I Told You America I Got This,\" Lyles posted on social media after winning Olympic gold.\n\nYes, Noah, you told us. And you backed it up.

It's the fifth gold medal won by Americans on Sunday (golfer Scottie Scheffler, cyclist Kristen Faulkner, swimmer Bobby Finke, and the women's 4x100 medley relay team).\n\nThe 27-year-old ran a 9.83 in the semifinal, automatically qualifying by finishing second in that race. He caught some flack on Saturday for finishing in second place in a heat, saying that his \"plan\" was to finish in first from there on out. That didn't happen - but it'll all be forgotten about now, as he finished first when it mattered most.\n\nOf course, some will argue he brought the hate upon himself when he quipped that NBA champions do not have the right to call themselves world champions. That comment alone has caused him to be hated by American sports fans just as much, maybe more, than he is loved by them. But, perhaps this victory can change the tide.\n\nUS WOMEN'S 4X100M MEDLEY RELAY TEAM WINS GOLD, SETS WORLD RECORD IN LAST OLYMPIC SWIMMING EVENT OF PARIS GAMES\n\nLyles will now turn his focus on the 200m (he's said his \"dream goal\" is to break Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19) and the 4x100m relay. It remains up in the air about whether he will be part of the 4x400m relay, but he was a part of the silver-medal winning team at this year's world indoor championships.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital back in March, Lyles said a friend told him, \"'Forget three, you need to go after four. Do something no one's ever done.'\"\n\n\"When you want to talk about being the greatest, that's what you have to achieve. So, I announced that that is a goal of mine to complete; why not do it on the biggest stage, the Olympics?\" Lyles said of a potential fourth Olympic event.\n\nTrack legend Carl Lewis recently told Fox News Digital that the sport \"needs\" Lyles to dominate these games.\n\n\"I think the sport needs someone like him that's a champion. He's the defending champion, the fastest man in the world right now, and we need someone to grab onto. I think he's the perfect guy to do that, and I'm excited about that,\" Lewis told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think track does better when we do have a superstar. That's why I think if Noah were to win, he would elevate the sport as well. As opposed to saying 'I wonder who's going to win,' people want to say 'I want him' or 'I don't want him.' They want to root for someone, or root against someone. I think it creates more intensity when you have someone that dominates, and that's been throughout history. . . .

I went up to him after, while we were waiting, and I even said 'I think you've got that, good going,' and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\"\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it (his name) and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it,\" he said.\n\n\"He was quite a few lanes down, he was in four, I was in seven so it was hard for me to picture where we were.\"\n\nThe 2023 Budapest world 100m and 200m champion has triumphed after only attaining bronze in his previous Olympics appearance in Tokyo's 200m event.\n\nLyles shared his struggles with depression and balancing antidepressants and their benefits with their negative side effects, such as weight gain affecting his performance which led him to wean of the treatment before the competition.\n\nDuring the event's build-up, the Gold Medallist revealed his difficulties in Tokyo, informing media: \"Usually I would say to myself, 'it's showtime' but I found myself thinking 'this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.'\"\n\nLyles had seemingly conquered his adversity in Paris, thumping his chest at the start line and pumping up the electrified crowd, clearly revelling in the moment.\n\nThe American got off to the joint slowest start, with an 0.178 reaction time alongside Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nAfter being informed of this compelling detail, Lyles said: \"Slowest reaction time - that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nLyle entered the Olympics with the third-fastest time at 100m this year behind Thompson's world-leading 9.77 and Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala's 9.79.\n\nThompson qualified fastest of the semi-finalists in 9.80, his compatriot Seville Oblique just behind him in a personal-best 9.81 and Lyles two hundredths of a second behind. Oblique was the only man who did not have to wait for his place to be confirmed - the last-placed man in 9.91.\n\nThe Floridian will be looking to do the double in the 200 metres when he competes in the event's heats stages at 6.55pm on Monday 5 August.\n\nTeam GB sprinter Louie Hinchliffe, who alongside Zharnel Hughes, saw his bid for Olympic 100m gold come to an end in the semi-finals said: \"It was a good experience, not the result that I wanted. Definitely a lot to learn. I haven't seen the race back.\n\n\"I am disappointed. The time is OK but it's where I finished in the race. I will come back stronger next year. I will not regress. It's my first year on the scene. There is a lot more to come.\"\n\n\"Definitely, definitely LA, I will be there (in the final). Next year as well. There are a lot of world championships between then and now. There is a lot of time.\"\n\nHughes has another chance to try for a first Olympic medal when the men's 200m heats begin on Monday.\n\nHe said: \"I am a fighter. I am very determined and that's why I wanted to give it a go. I got the training in but the races is what I needed to get me race sharp.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zharnel_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zharnel Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/S5EKM7YKVRES7MYE4PMGQYDILM.jpg?smart=true&auth=a0cd49c7798d25a14f682c8b48d37594a41ca60957da8ca10c5728c2c8122d6b&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2820, "textEnd": 2828}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

USA's Noah Lyles defeated Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by a fraction of a second, 0.005 seconds to be precise to bag the title of the fastest man going around.\n\nIt was a sensational photo finish as Noah Lyles came back from behind to win the Olympic men's 100m title. The difference between Gold medalist Noah Lyles and Oblique Seville was just 0.22 seconds.\n\nNoah Lyles was the slowest to get off the block and the last amongst the 8 runners at the 30m mark. However, the world 100m and 200m champion kicked on and edged Kishane Thompson, who topped the semi-finals, by a whisker. The victory was sealed by the barest of margins in a spectacular photo finish.\n\nParis Olympics, Day 9 Highlights | Full Schedule | Medal Table\n\nIt appeared that Kishane Thompson's boot went past the finish line first, but Lyles aced the finishing position, getting his torso ahead. The crowd at the Stade de France held its breath along with the runners to learn the result of the men's 100m race after the photo finish. They were made to wait for a few seconds before the official result was displayed on the big screen, much to the delight of Lyles and the American fans in Paris.\n\nWondering how Noah Lyles won the Gold? Not able to decipher the positions from the photo finish? Don't worry. Read on.\n\nInitially, it appeared that Thompson might have won, but after a thorough review of the photo finish images, Lyles was declared the winner with a time of 9.79 seconds, just five-thousandths of a second ahead of Thompson. This victory highlighted the rules governing photo finishes in athletics and the most critical aspect of it -- the torso crossing the finish line first.\n\n1. Slit-Video System: The primary technology used to determine the winner in a photo finish is the slit-video system. This system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line, capturing images 2,000 times per second. This provides an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line, which is then coordinated with the athlete's time.\n\n2. Backup Camera: In addition to the slit-video system, there is a backup camera positioned on the other side of the field. This camera ensures that the finish is captured even if a runner is obscured by another athlete.\n\n3. Flash Timer: The flash timer, which clocks the final times of athletes, has a margin of error. At worst, this error can be within 0.01 or 0.02 of the official time. This margin is crucial in extremely close finishes like the one between Lyles and Thompson.\n\n4. Torso Crossing: The most critical aspect of a photo finish is the body part that must cross the finish line. According to Olympic rules, it is the torso (or trunk) of the athlete that must cross the line, not the head, arms, legs, or feet. This is why some runners lean forward when crossing the line, ensuring their torso crosses first.\n\n5. Diving Across the Finish Line: While it is legal for runners to dive across the finish line, it is not significantly faster than running the last few steps. Studies have shown that acceleration decreases while a runner is in the air, making diving less effective than it might seem.\n\n6. Review Process: In the event of a close finish, officials review the images captured by the slit-video system and backup camera to determine the winner. This review process ensures that the athlete who crosses the finish line first, as defined by the torso crossing, is declared the winner.\n\nNoah Lyles, who has proved his mettle at the biggest stage, will now be favourites to win the sprint double in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/noah-lyles-in-a-photo-finish-050451615-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=xqoQCc3IPwpB_WhC5KMXw0JpWBJU2dRf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 123, "textEnd": 131}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr

it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

He is a heavy favorite in the 200 meters, his better race, and a race he has not lost since the Olympic final in Tokyo three years ago, where he finished third. Opening heats for the 200 were set for Monday night.\n\nLyles' willingness -- make that, desire -- to be the front man for a sport that yearns for new fans feels like a game-changer to Seb Coe, the World Athletics president who called Sunday's race \"if not perfect, about as close to perfect as you can get.\"\n\n\"If I'm wearing a promoter's hat, then him winning last night was important, because he's now creating a narrative that's heading us back into Usain Bolt territory,\" Coe said. \"That's hugely important.\"\n\nIn a typically candid and engaging post-race news conference, Lyles made no secret that he is in this to promote his sport, but also wants more.\n\nHe has been a front man for the popular Netflix documentary \"SPRINT,\" and has brought a sense of fashion back to the track, making \"walk-ins\" a thing and bedazzling his hair with white pearls on race day.\n\nNow, he's got a message for his shoe sponsor, Adidas.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" he said. \"I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious. I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes, there's money in sneakers. I feel like for how many medals we bring back and the notoriety we get, the fact that hasn't happened, that's crazy for me. I feel like that needs to happen.\"\n\nThe 100 was the biggest hurdle for Lyles to overcome. It is not his best race, and it's the one he took up shortly after Tokyo with the goal of becoming more than a mere sprinter, but a larger-than-life personality, both on and off the track.\n\nLyles also figures to feature prominently in the men's 4x100 relay but that's anything but a gimme.\n\nRiddled with poor work with the baton, a lack of consistent training habits, a doping positive and the constant spectre of trying to beat Bolt, the U.S. has not won, and kept, a single Olympic medal in this event since 2004. It hasn't captured gold since 2000.\n\nThe relay is a bigger threat to Lyles' quest to win three gold medals, the way Bolt did in all three of his appearances, than the 200 meters.\n\nLyles figures to get his biggest challenge in the 200 from Kenny Bednarek, who finished ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and, more recently, pushed him at a fast Olympic trails that Lyles won in 19.53.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tobogo, American Erryion Knighton and defending champion Andre De Grasse are also in the mix. One interesting wager would be whether Lyles has more of a chance of losing the race or lowering his American record of 19.31. Bolt's world record is 19.19.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Coe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Coe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/65TxMRDC7IXT_fCxN8f2FNITJ74=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/OIYMMMNNSYOVTULJ6FN3CTW6KY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Lyles paced the track with his hands draped over his head. Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nThis was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or maybe even ever. Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now these Greensboro families want answers.\n\nThank goodness they do now.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second, which was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second in this one.\n\nWhat was the difference? Maybe Lyles' closing speed and his lean into the line.\n\nHe and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of the line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nIt would take more than a mere 9.7(84) seconds to decide who would supplant Marcell Jacobs as the next Olympic champion.\n\nLyles patted Thompson on the shoulder while the wait grew -- from 10, to 20, then nearly 30 seconds. When the American learned he'd added this to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nYes, he's the World's Fastest Man. Just not by a lot.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

It's the fifth gold medal won by Americans on Sunday (golfer Scottie Scheffler, cyclist Kristen Faulkner, swimmer Bobby Finke, and the women's 4\u00d7100 medley relay team).\n\nThe 27-year-old ran a 9.83 in the semifinal, automatically qualifying by finishing second in that race. He caught some flak on Saturday for finishing in second place in a heat, saying that his \"plan\" was to finish in first from there on out. That didn't happen - but it'll all be forgotten about now, as he finished first when it mattered most.\n\nOf course, some will argue he brought the hate upon himself when he quipped that NBA champions do not have the right to call themselves world champions. That comment alone has caused him to be hated by American sports fans just as much, maybe more, than he is loved by them. But, perhaps this victory can change the tide.\n\nUS WOMEN'S 4X100M MEDLEY RELAY TEAM WINS GOLD, SETS WORLD RECORD IN LAST OLYMPIC SWIMMING EVENT OF PARIS GAMES\n\nLyles will now turn his focus on the 200m (he's said his \"dream goal\" is to break Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19) and the 4x100m relay. It remains up in the air about whether he will be part of the 4x400m relay, but he was a part of the silver-medal winning team at this year's world indoor championships.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital in March, Lyles said a friend told him, \"'Forget three, you need to go after four. Do something no one's ever done.'\"\n\n\"When you want to talk about being the greatest, that's what you have to achieve. So, I announced that that is a goal of mine to complete; why not do it on the biggest stage, the Olympics?\" Lyles said of a potential fourth Olympic event.\n\nTrack legend Carl Lewis recently told Fox News Digital that the sport \"needs\" Lyles to dominate these games.\n\n\"I think the sport needs someone like him that's a champion. He's the defending champion, the fastest man in the world right now, and we need someone to grab onto. I think he's the perfect guy to do that, and I'm excited about that,\" Lewis told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think track does better when we do have a superstar. That's why I think if Noah were to win, he would elevate the sport as well. As opposed to saying 'I wonder who's going to win,' people want to say 'I want him' or 'I don't want him.' They want to root for someone, or root against someone. I think it creates more intensity when you have someone that dominates, and that's been throughout history.... People have really gravitated to the sport when people really dominated more.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://wfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WFIN-AM-FM-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Finally, the numbers came up. Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out Thompson by five-thousandths of a tick of the clock.\n\nLyles said he thought he had given the win away by dipping at the line too soon, so he went up to Thompson and told him, \"Bro, I think you got that one.\"\n\n\"But then my name popped up and I'm like 'Oh my gosh, amazing!'\" said Lyles, who was a high school track star in Virginia when he ran for T.C.

Back then, Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn't go down into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics' first ever photo finish.\n\n\"I thought I had (him) cleared,\" Thompson said. \"But I wasn't sure. It was so close.\"\n\nLyles became the first American to win the marquee event in Olympic track since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nThe 9.784 also marks a personal best for Lyles, who has been promising to add his own brand of excitement to track and certainly delivered this time.\n\nHe will be a favorite later this week in the 200 meters -- his better race -- and will try to join Usain Bolt as the latest runner to win both Olympic sprints.\n\nLyles and Thompson had two of the three slowest bursts from the blocks, and Thompson had what sufficed for a \"lead\" at the halfway point. The photo finish actually shows Kerley's orange shoe well in front of everything at the finish line. But it's the chest breaking the barrier that counts, and Lyles beat everyone by a sliver.\n\nWhen the American learned he had added the Olympic title to the 100 meters he won at world championships last year, he pulled off his name tag and raised it to the sky, then brought his hands to his side and pointed at the camera.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\n\"America, I told you I got this!\" he yelled into the camera.\n\nAlso Sunday, Blacksburg resident Cole Hocker and former Virginia Tech standout Neil Gourley advanced to Tuesday's final of the men's 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker, a former University of Oregon star who has trained at Virginia Tech since November, finished third in his 12-man semifinal heat with a time of 3:32.54. The top six runners in each heat advanced to Tuesday's final.\n\nGourley, running for Great Britain, finished third in the other semifinal heat with a time of 3:32.11.\n\nGourley, a Scotland native, was third overall. Hocker, a Pennsylvania native running in his second Olympics, was 10th overall.\n\nAs a senior, Gourley ran the anchor leg for the Tech distance medley relay team that won gold at the 2018 NCAA indoor championships.\n\nGold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.\n\nMahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia's Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport's biggest prize of all -- Olympic gold -- to her world championship and world record.\n\nKerr vs. Ingebrigtsen set for men's 1,500\n\nThe best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.\n\nThey squared off in Sunday's semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said.\n\nDid Ingebrigtsen agree?\n\n\"Depends who you ask, maybe,\" he said. \"I mean, racing is what you want it to be.\"\n\nGallery: Richmond Crusade for Voters holds forum for mayor candidates\n\nThe Roanoke Times contributed to this report.\n\nMore coverage\n\nSPORTS: UVa's Gretchen Walsh wins another relay gold medal.

I went up to him after, while we were waiting, and I even said 'I think you've got that, good going,' and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it (his name) and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it.\n\n\"He was quite a few lanes down, he was in four, I was in seven so it was hard for me to picture where we were.\"\n\nThe American world 100m and 200m champion's triumph comes three summers after he entered the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the 200m favourite and world champion - but only claimed bronze.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about a lifelong battle with depression and the challenges of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform - ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nEarlier this week, he acknowledged he performs better in front of a full house, remembering the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself \"it's showtime\", but instead found himself thinking \"this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.\"\n\nLyles had no such trouble in Paris, where he thumped his chest at the start line and pumped up the electrified crowd, clearly revelling in the occasion, before they fell so quiet at the start of the race that it was possible to hear a plane passing overhead.\n\nThen the man whose weakness is often said to be his starts got off to the joint slowest, an 0.178 reaction time alongside Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nLyles, only learning that fact from a journalist, said: \"Slowest reaction time - that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nUSA\u00b4s Noah Lyles celebrates winning the men\u00b4s 100m final (David Davies/PA).\n\nHe entered these Olympics with the third-fastest time at 100m this year behind Thompson's world-leading 9.77 and Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala's 9.79, and as a result found himself in a position of needing to back up his signature bravado on Sunday night.\n\nThompson qualified fastest of the semi-finalists in 9.80, his compatriot Seville Oblique just behind him in a personal-best 9.81 and Lyles two hundredths of a second behind.\n\nOblique was the only man who did not have to wait for his place to be confirmed - the last-placed man in 9.91.\n\nLyles is in Paris with a point to prove, embroiled in a debate before the Games about who was currently fastest man on the planet - not that he ever had any doubts.\n\nThe Floridian - who is looking to do the double in the 200 metres - emphatically reiterated his answer, this time with his feet instead of his rhetoric.\n\nGreat Britain's Louie Hinchliffe (left) and USA's Noah Lyles during the men's 100 metres semi-finals (Martin Rickett/PA).\n\nEarlier, Team GB sprinters Louie Hinchliffe and Zharnel Hughes saw their bid for Olympic 100m gold come to and end in the semi-finals.\n\nHinchliffe said: \"It was a good experience, not the result that I wanted. Definitely a lot to learn. I haven't seen the race back.\n\n\"I am disappointed. The time is OK but it's where I finished in the race. I will come back stronger next year. I will not regress. It's my first year on the scene. There is a lot more to come.\n\nIt was a good experience, not the result that I wanted. Definitely a lot to learn. Louie Hinchliffe\n\n\"Definitely, definitely LA, I will be there (in the final). Next year as well. There are a lot of world championships between then and now. There is a lot of time.\n\nHughes has another chance to try for a first Olympic medal when the men's 200m heats begin on Monday.\n\nGreat Britain\u00b4s Zharnel Hughes after finishing sixth in his men\u00b4s 100 metres semi-final (Martin Rickett/PA).\n\nHe said: \"I am a fighter. I am very determined and that's why I wanted to give it a go. I got the training in but the races is what I needed to get me race sharp.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They've been doing a good job and getting already our name out.\n\n\"What we need to do as a sport is take advantage and say 'Hey, we need to make this as available as possible for people to come and watch', so you don't have to go to back alley websites to try and find or pay to watch websites to get a hold of this.\n\nALSO READ | Noah Lyles sprints the talk to 100m glory in Paris Olympics 2024\n\n\"This needs to be accessible because this is a world sport. So we need to be able to show it to the world.\"\n\nFrom a personal point of view, Lyles says he hopes his success can prompt a major sports equipment manufacturer to put his name on his own branded shoe in the style of NBA great Jordan's deal with Nike.\n\nLyles noted that few US track and field athletes, including the likes of 1996 Olympic 400m and 200m champion Michael Johnson, ever had that opportunity.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" Lyles said. \"I want my own trainer. Dead serious. I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes.\n\n\"Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, the notoriety we get, the fact that hasn't happened is crazy to me.\n\n\"So that needs to happen.\"\n\nLyles meanwhile was simply relieved to deliver on his promise of victory after boldly stating all season that he was \"unbeatable\".\n\n\"It feels good to back it up,\" Lyles said. \"I've seen tons of scenarios where athletes come in as a favourite

It was also the first US men's 100m gold since Justin Gatlin's success 20 years ago in Athens.\n\nThe women's high jump was also a very close affair, with top favourite Yaroslava Mahuchikh needing countback to beat Australia's Nicola Olyslagers.\n\nThe third gold of the night went to Canadian world champion Ethan Katzberg in the men's hammer throw.\n\nLyles delivers when it matters\n\nLyles won a 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble at the 2019 and 2023 worlds and came to Paris with the aim of repeating it at the Olympic stage, with his popularity also soaring via the Sprint documentary film.\n\nHe was beaten in his heat and semi-final but had promised fireworks for the final.\n\nSeason leader Thompson had his usual fast start and led at the halfway mark but Lyles and the others the closed in.\n\nLyles pipped Thompson right at the line, and former world champion Fred Kerley got bronze two-hundredths back, gto go with Tokyo silver.\n\nTokyo winner Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth and even seventh-placed Kenneth Bednarek of the US just nine-hundredths off the top.\n\nWhat they said\n\n\"It's been a rollercoaster, ups and downs. I'm usually a guy who likes to come out blazing in all my rounds, especially in the 200m. But the 100m, it's my first time here on the Olympic stage,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practise over the years',\" he said inn reference to the last Games where he had to settle for 200m bronze.\n\nIt's accumulated to this point. You only need one. As long as that's the last one, that's all that matters.\"\n\nThompson said: \"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learnt from it.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought the gold should have shared, he said: think the sport is too competitive, no offence to any other sport. It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\n\n\"I'm feeling very good, honestly. My body language will not show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad.\"\n\nIt will be a quick turnaround for Lyles and others as the 200m heats are scheduled for Monday night.\n\nTight high jump\n\nMahuchikh meanwhile added Olympic gold to her Tokyo bronze and the 2023 world title but it was closer than expected for the athlete who had recently bettered the long standing world record to 2.10m at another Paris venue.\n\nMahuchikh and Olyslagers cleared 2.00 metres but Mahuchikh did so in her first attempt while Olyslagers needed three to get silver as at the 2022 worlds.\n\nTwo more athletes from Ukraine and Australia made the podium as Iryna Gerashchenko and 2022 world champion Eleanor Patterson shared bronze with 1.98m apiece and the same amount of jumps.\n\n\"Finally, I got this gold medal,\" said Mahuckikh who gave Ukraine a second Paris gold, following the women's sabre fencing team. The medals are to give Ukrainians some joy amid the ongoing Russian invasion.\n\nHammer, prelims and Monday\n\nIn the hammer throw, Katzberg was in a league of his own and the only man to go beyond 80m, winninng with 84.12m from Hungary's Bence Halasz and Mykhaylo Kokhan who got Ukraine's third medal on the night.\n\nIn preliminary action which started in the morning, women's 100m champion Julien Alfred of St Lucia coasted into the 200m semi-finals.\n\nWorld champion Femke Bol won her 400m hurdles heat the day after giving the Netherlands mixed relay gold, with American Tokyo winner and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone also through en route to one of the most anticipated gold medal showdowns.\n\nBritish gold medal favourite Keely Hodgkinson cruised into Monday's women's 800m final; and compatriot world champion Josh Kerr into the 1,500m final alongside Norway's Tokyo champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen.\n\nThe other finals Monday are the men's pole vault with Swedish

Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them. I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles admitted though that even he had doubted whether he had clinched the gold.\n\n\"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm gonna be honest, bro, I think you had that one,'\" Lyles said.\n\n\"And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nThe win completes a rollercoaster three years for Lyles, who had left the pandemic-hit Tokyo Olympics in tears after a disappointing campaign, citing his mental health struggles and battles with depression.\n\nThe American is now targeting an Olympic double with victory in the 200m next week.\n\nUkraine medal rush\n\nLyles' win was the sensational final act of another thrilling day in the Olympic athletics arena that saw three gold medals handed out.\n\nIn other action, Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh lived up to her pre-Paris Games billing to win the women's high jump.\n\nThe world champion and world record holder managed a best of 2.00 metres to win on countback from Australia's Nicola Olyslagers.\n\nAnother Australian, Eleanor Patterson, claimed joint bronze with another Ukrainian, Iryna Gerashchenko, both on 1.95m.\n\nIn the men's hammer, Canadian world champion Ethan Katzberg won after unleashing a mammoth heave with his first throw to clinch the gold medal.\n\nThe 22-year-old from British Columbia registered 84.12m with his opening effort to leave his rivals trailing throughout the competition.\n\nThat was four metres further than his nearest rival, Hungary's Bence Halasz, who took silver with a throw of 79.97m. Ukraine's Mykhaylo Kokhan collected bronze with a throw of 79.39m.\n\nElsewhere Sunday, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol eased through the opening round of the women's 400m hurdles to remain on an Olympic collision course.\n\nUS star McLaughlin-Levrone, the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder, cruised through her heat to win in 53.60sec.\n\nBol meanwhile shrugged off the after-effects of her dazzling performance in Saturday's 4x400m mixed relay to coast through her heat in a leading 53.38sec.\n\nAnother mouthwatering duel is looming in the women's 800m, where Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, a silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, is poised for an epic battle with Kenya's 2023 World Champion Mary Moraa on Monday.\n\nHodgkinson delivered an ice-cool performance to win her semi-final in 1min 56.86sec, the fastest time of the round. Moraa advanced after winning her heat in 1:57.86.\n\nIn the opening round of the men's 400m, Britain's Matt Hudson-Smith got his bid for gold off to a smooth start, winning his heat in 44.78sec.\n\nUS sprinter Michael Norman set the early first round pace however with the quickest time, a brisk 44.10sec.

Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track.\n\nRead Next Related Reads Irish trio

I went up to him after, while we were waiting, and I even said 'I think you've got that, good going,' and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it (his name) and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it.\n\n\"He was quite a few lanes down, he was in four, I was in seven so it was hard for me to picture where we were.\"\n\nThe American world 100m and 200m champion's triumph comes three summers after he entered the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the 200m favourite and world champion - but only claimed bronze.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about a lifelong battle with depression and the challenges of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform - ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nEarlier this week, he acknowledged he performs better in front of a full house, remembering the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself \"it's showtime\", but instead found himself thinking \"this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.\"\n\nLyles had no such trouble in Paris, where he thumped his chest at the start line and pumped up the electrified crowd, clearly revelling in the occasion, before they fell so quiet at the start of the race that it was possible to hear a plane passing overhead.\n\nThen the man whose weakness is often said to be his starts got off to the joint slowest, an 0.178 reaction time alongside Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nLyles, only learning that fact from a journalist, said: \"Slowest reaction time - that's crazy!

the last-placed man in 9.91.\n\nLyles is in Paris with a point to prove, embroiled in a debate before the Games about who was currently fastest man on the planet - not that he ever had any doubts.\n\nThe Floridian -

All eight sprinters crossed the finish line in an almighty heap and the winner was decided subsequently. USA's Noah Lyles claimed the gold by a whisker as he was just ahead of second-placed Kishane Thompson of Jamaica. Let's decode the fastest male athletes to complete the 100m race at the Olympics.\n\nJamaican legend Usain Bolt claimed eight medals at the Olympics, all gold. The sprinter covered 100 meters in just 9.63 seconds in the final of the 2012 London Games. This remains an all-time Olympic record. Bolt also holds the second spot on this list, having clocked 9.69 seconds in the final of the 2008 event, which took place in Beijing.\n\nIn Yohan Blake, we have another Jamaican on this list. He clocked 9.75 seconds in the 2012 London Games final but had to settle for the silver as Bolt walked away with the gold. Notably, that was Blake's debut Olympics campaign. Meanwhile, the bronze in that race went to USA's Justin Gatlin, who timed 9.79 seconds. Gatlin hence stands fourth on the all-time list.\n\nThe 2024 men's 100-meter final was a crazy affair as Lyles triumphed by an extremely narrow margin. Both Lyles and Thompson bobbed over the line in 9.79 seconds and it took several replays to decide the winner. The official results showed just how close it was.

It's too competitive for us to share a gold medal.\"\n\nThompson's time - 9.789, against Lyles' 9.784 - was two hundredths of a second off his personal best of 9.77 set in June.\n\nThe Lyles-Thompson showdown was the latest chapter in a sprint rivalry between the U.S. and Jamaica that has gripped the sport for almost two decades.\n\nBolt won three successive 100 and 200 metres Olympic golds, and Yohan Blake weighed in with a silver in 2012. In world championships, Bolt and Blake won four 100s in a row between from 2009 to 2015 while Bolt nailed four successive 200s and helped his country to four sprint relay golds.\n\nIt was a domination the United States could not match during the best part of a century as the sprint superpower, and with Jamaica's women also routinely filling the top step of their podiums, the Caribbean nation was on top of the world.\n\nSince Bolt's retirement in 2017, however, Jamaica's gold rush has dried up, and a succession of male sprinters have been built up as \"the new Bolt\", a pressure they could surely do without.\n\n\"I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold, everybody loves winners,\" Thompson said. \"I would have loved to win today, but big up to the whole field.\"\n\nFellow Jamaican Oblique Seville, who had beaten Lyles to win their semi-final on Sunday, was left in tears after finishing last, albeit in an impressive time of 9.91 seconds.

The sprinter is calling for greater visibility and financial support for the sport in his country, to restore the international glory it once had.\n\nLast Sunday, the 27-year-old American sprinter broke the title drought that the United States had been maintaining for a couple of decades in the 100m race, perhaps the most prestigious event of the Games. The victory was especially significant for Lyles, who has repeatedly criticised the low profile of athletics in his country, where sports such as the NBA, NFL and baseball dominate the media attention and fan base.\n\nLyles hopes that his gold medal, coupled with the success of the Netflix documentary series 'Sprint', will provide an opportunity for athletics, and himself, to gain more visibility and financial support. \"I want to see a continuation of the ability to seize moments for our sport. Sprint was a success and I know they are already filming the second season. They've done a good job of getting the word out about our sport,\" Lyles told a press conference.\n\nThe Olympic champion stressed the importance of making the sport more accessible to everyone. \"We need to make this as accessible as possible for people, so they don't have to search on hard-to-find websites or pay to watch it. This is a global sport and we need to show it to the world,\" he said.\n\nLyles emphasised that in order for athletics to grow in popularity and reach a wider audience, it is essential to facilitate access to competitions and events. According to the sprinter, this greater accessibility could be the key to increasing the fan base and ultimately attracting more sponsors and commercial opportunities.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, Lyles hopes that his success will lead a major sporting goods manufacturer to create a line of shoes with his name on them, emulating Michael Jordan's famous deal with Nike. According to the runner, few American athletes have had the opportunity to have their own brand of footwear. \"I want my own shoe,\" Lyles declared. \"I want my own shoe. I really do. There's no money in the spikes of athletic shoes. Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own shoe. It's amazing to me that, with the amount of medals we win and the notoriety we get, that hasn't happened yet. So that needs to change.\"\n\nLyles stressed the importance of recognising the value and contribution of track athletes, as he understands that track athletes, despite their achievements, do not receive the same level of recognition and financial rewards as athletes in other disciplines. A shoe deal would not only be a significant personal achievement for the American, but could also open the door for other runners to receive similar opportunities.\n\nFinally, Lyles expressed relief at fulfilling his promise of victory, after proclaiming all season that he was \"unbeatable\". \"It's satisfying to be able to back up my words,\" Lyles said. \"I've seen a lot of cases where athletes come in as favourites and things don't end up going their way.\" His ability to handle pressure and live up to expectations has cemented his status as one of the world's top athletes, and his victory could be the catalyst American athletics needs to reach new heights.\n\nLyles has ended America's long wait for a gold medal in the 100m sprint, as the last time an American won gold in this category was in Athens in 2004, with Justin Gatlin. His victory not only marks a personal milestone, but also brings his country back to the top of the 100m after a decade dominated by the legendary Usain Bolt and the Jamaican sprinters.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "javier_carro@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Javier Carro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/301425/o/GettyImages-2164174554.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Fred Kerley picked up his second Olympic medal in third place. Kerley was runner-up in Tokyo.\n\nNoah Lyles did what he sought to do.

The photo finish image appears to show Thompson's leg ahead of the the finish line further than Lyles. So how then did Lyles take the gold?\n\nHere's a breakdown of the simple rules of a photo finish in athletics.\n\nHow does World Athletics - the body governing international athletics - explain a photo finish?\n\nAs the runners approach the finish line, a \"slit-video\" system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line -- scans it 2,000 times per second, providing an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line -- and coordinates it with the athlete's time.\n\nIn addition to that, there's a back-up camera on the other side of the field in case a runner is hidden or blocked by another runner.\n\nThe flash timer that clocks the final times of athletes has a margin of error which at worse can throw up an error within 0.01 or 0.02 of the official time.\n\nNow the most important part to determine the official timing which in turn decides the race is the body part that has to cross the finish line.\n\nIn the 100m final in the Paris Olympics, Thompson's foot looks like it breached first. But the body part that has to cross the finish line for an official registration of timing is the torso of the athlete. The torso or the trunk of a person includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and the back.\n\nLatest on SportstarNoah Lyles wins 100m final: How is a photo finish decided in Olympics?Team SportstarTNPL 2024 Final: Ashwin's Dragons bring home the trophy in styleTarun ShastryNoah Lyles sprints the talk to 100m glory in Paris Olympics 2024 Jonathan SelvarajAthletics, Paris 2024 Olympics, Day 9 -- August 4 highlights: USA's Noah Lyles wins men's 100m gold; Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins high jumpTeam SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Will Amit Rohidas play semifinal after getting red card against Great Britain?Team SportstarREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslava_Mahuchikh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yaroslava Mahuchikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Rohidas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amit Rohidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pelvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/4de6by/article68486321.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/image%20-%202024-08-05T042922.304.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2153, "textEnd": 2161}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

He tapped into his prime and delivered his personal best performance in front of a jam-packed crowd at the Stade de France.\n\nThe United States' Noah Lyles won the men's 100-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, August 4, making him the fastest man in the world. In one of the most thrilling 100-meter finals in Games history, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson took home the silver medal, narrowly missing out on the gold. USA's Fred Kerley won the bronze, and Italy's highly strapped Tokyo Olympics champion Jacobs Lamont Marcell came in fifth.\n\nKnown for his explosive acceleration and finishing power, Lyles set an amazing time to win the gold, just missing out on Thompson, who made an equally remarkable but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to settle for silver. The picture finish demonstrated the intense rivalry in the Olympic Games and emphasised the razor-thin margins that determine success in the world of sprinting.\n\nIn a race that wrapped up within a blink of an eye, Noah clocked of 9.784s to walk away with the gold. He was just 0.16 seconds of breaking the legendary Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63s. Jamaica's Kishane Thompson settled for silver after falling short by a fraction of a second in one of the closest 100m races in the history of the Summer Games.\n\nNoah's compatriot Fred Kerley clinched the bronze medal with his season-best timing of 9.81s. Following his triumph, Noah became the first United States athlete to bag a gold since Justin Gatlin stood at the top of the podium in 2004 in the 100m race.\n\nAthletes had to wait for some time for the results as all eight sprinters participating in the event were separated by the tiniest of the margins for the gold medal. In the end, it was declared that Noah had 0.005s ahead of Kishane to finish at the top of the podium. Following the announcement, the crowd erupted in a roar and went berserk, applauding the American sprinter for his remarkable triumph.\n\nHe ripped his name from his shirt and held it high in the air. South Africa's Akane Simbine once again missed out on a podium finish by a whisker as he finished fourth. In the Tokyo and Rio Olympics, Simbine was close but fell short of getting his hands on an Olympic medal in the event.

Especially some of the runners from Jamaica who were in the media for their \"beef\" with Lyles.\n\nLyles will compete in the 200-meter on Monday and will look to be the first runner to win the 100-meter and the 200-meter since Carl Lewis in 1984.\n\nSharpe has been a prime supporter of the U.S. Olympian for quite some time and made sure that support was felt after he won by a photo finish in epic fashion.\n\nRelated: Knicks' Josh Hart Defends Noah Lyles Amid His Controversial NBA Comment", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cole_sullivan@postandcourier.com", "name": "Cole Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Sharpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Generally, all the US star needs is to have a sniff at halfway and then his rivals are running scared. That was exactly what transpired here.\n\nAfter a decent semi-final earlier in the night, when he clocked 9.83 behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville (9.81), Lyles emerged for the final wired to the hilt, hopping around in front of his blocks, geeing up the crowd.\n\nThe others were more subdued, but Lyles has long considered himself the main character in this sport and as he stood behind his blocks, awaiting starter's orders, he continued yelping, psyching himself up with self-talk, doing his best to unsettle his rivals.\n\nThompson, who had the world lead at 9.77, got off to a decent start but the giant Jamaican had yet to face pressure like this, needing to stay relaxed as an Olympic gold medal appeared within grasp. Around the same time Lyles loomed up in his peripheral vision, Thompson tightened up, and in the 100m there's no bigger threat to top-end speed than tension.\n\nAfter the finish, Lyles faced a nerve-racking period of waiting, gazing, hoping, before he saw the result he had spoken into existence. Noah Lyles: Olympic champion.\n\n\"You couldn't have asked for a bigger moment,\" he said.\n\nLyles admitted he was \"a little upset\" after clocking just 10.04 in his heat.\n\n\"I came with the aggression and after I ran the 9.83, I said I was done with that and my sports therapist said, 'You gotta let go, release it'.\"\n\nThat he did, staying admirably relaxed in the final and running his way into the history books. Given his form, it will come as a huge surprise if he doesn't add 200m gold.\n\n\"There's plenty more [to come],\" he said. \"I hope you guys like Noah, because I got a lot more coming.\"\n\nElsewhere, Cathal Doyle produced a fine performance in the 1,500m semi-finals, the Clonliffe athlete finishing 10th in a lifetime best of 3:33.15, moving him second on the Irish all-time list.\n\nDoyle ran in the middle of the pack as 400m was reached in a swift 57 seconds and 800m in 1:55, but he got shuffled to the back on the third lap, passing the bell 12th.\n\nHe unleashed his typically strong final lap to close on the leaders down the back straight, turning for home with just a few metres to find to reach an Olympic final via a top-six finish. But in his third race in three days - having won the repechage the day before - he had little left to offer.\n\n\"I'm not a million miles off the top 12 in the world,\" he said. \"Obviously, I was a tiny bit disappointed when I saw the time, I wanted a 3:32 and three races in a row is not ideal. But I thought I'd feel worse.\n\n\"I positioned myself well, got myself up and in the mix. The legs started pinching earlier than I'd hoped and it's hard when everyone is going for it - the whole field at the same pace. Usually, I can just drift past people.\n\n\"But I didn't give up, I fought and got back in the mix and with 250 to go I was like, 'Shit, do I have a chance here?'\"\n\nDoyle had reason to reflect with pride on his first global championship.\n\n\"This is my first year where I've had barely any niggles. It's another year of more training. I switched coach in October and I joined a new group. With another year of being around them, I'll hopefully move myself to Brighton, find a job or an income so I can go over and stay with them full-time. That will bring me on again even more.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the first 1,500m semi-final, Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway and Josh Kerr of Britain served up an appetiser for what's ahead in tomorrow's final.\n\nAfter a slow opening lap, Ingebrigtsen, the reigning Olympic champion, swept to the front and kept the pace strong thereafter. With Kerr tracking his every move, the pair kept a lid on things and didn't let their egos take over down the home straight.\n\nIngebrigtsen coasted to the finish in 3:32.88, with Kerr looking equally relaxed just behind in 3:32.46.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cathal_dennehy@independent.ie", "name": "Cathal Dennehy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/eWTwvTFSrzpjj3Wz84_LBFJWTuE=/400x280/smart/prod-mh-ireland/54fc0807-d19f-4c3c-807b-db0ab7fee979/e0aeed36-25be-4a1c-87e2-3537c0b5616a/OLYMPIC%20%284644%29.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

It took 30 paces to make it real\n\nNoah Lyles always said he was a star. He told anyone who would listen, from coaches, to fellow athletes, to the population of the world via the high-rolling Netflix film Sprint. Well, now they really are going to have to believe him, as on a lovely soft powder blue night in Saint Denis, Lyles produced one of the most startling Olympic sprint final finishes to claim the Paris 2024 men's 100m gold medal.\n\nLyles, the US and world No 1, had been an extraordinary presence in the build-up to this race. He is almost overwhelmingly charming in the flesh, all superstar sheen and utterly disarming honesty about his own flaws, his own superhero strengths, always on, always capturing the main stage. By the time he reached the start line in Paris for the men's final - along with the women's race, the keynote of this entire two-week circus - there was a sense of a man right on the edge. But of what exactly?\n\nIn the event it required an extraordinary act of will mid-race to seize this moment. With 50 metres run in Paris Lyles was in seventh place. The day was starting to stretch and fray at the edges, to take on a different shape in those strangely still mid-race seconds.\n\nLyles might have begun to tighten and lose his forward thrust. Instead he produced an astonishing slingshot finish, surging through the field to take the race by five thousandths of a second. And so the Olympic Games, always so hungry for product, light, heat, has a new star.\n\nLyles is 27. This is his Games, his moment in the crosshairs, the perfect star, and the perfect stage. In the moments before the race the Stade had been drenched in a spectacular light show. A middle aged man in sunglasses had appeared on the big screen to do some DJ-ing, as though only this could possibly increase the glamour, the electricity of the moment.\n\nThe real challenge to Lyles here was Kishane Thompson from Jamaica, a wonderful emerging talent. Thompson is so new to this level he doesn't even have a proper biography on the IOC website (it basically says, Gender: Male. Function: athlete).\n\nBut he had looked awesome in the semi-finals, running as though the air was frankly a little too thin for his liking. Here he came out and roared like a lion. Lyles did something wild, running off down the track, bouncing and whirling, grabbing great handfuls of air. Hmm. Was that a good idea? Was it actually worth doing anything else at this stage?\n\nIt is no secret that there are wider pressures in play here. Seb Coe and World Athletics always had a plan for these Olympic Games. The entire staging is in effect a product relaunch for track and field as a whole.\n\nThe epic years of the cold war opposition are long gone, that period where the sprint records were held up as a kind of barometer of human progress, like the arms race or the moon landings. Usain Bolt's brilliance kept the circus afloat. But really this spectacle has become second tier since Rio 2016.\n\nIt shouldn't be like this. Sprinting is a perfect spectator sport, so simple, so accessible. This is primal stuff. The humans are running. The humans are running fast. Who is the fastest human? But on a scale of talent versus fame the world's greatest sprinters are also among the world's least recognisable elite athletes.\n\nThe answer is to create stars. And World Athletics has invested. Only this week Coe could be heard talking in Paris about the Netflix documentary Sprint, of which he is an executive producer, boasting of its status as the sixth most viewed entity on the platform. It's a nice piece of work, but it is also framed to transform its two most marketable properties, Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson into global stars, a twin pronged assault linked to these Games.\n\nUnfortunately life is what tends to happen while you're making plans. There was an indelible glory to Julien Alfred's gold in the women's 100m on Saturday night, a first ever medal for St Lucia. But it also contained a note of mischief. The best part of sport is that it just won't follow the script.\n\nSo we came to Lyles and the men's race. The sky above the lip of the roof was still pink as the athletes knelt at their blocks. Sprinters come in different genres. Most follow the angry avenger template, always chasing something. Then we have the prey, the sprinter who seems instead to be fleeing. Britain's newest star Louie Hinchliffe runs like he's being chased by a swarm of bees.\n\nThompson is a classic floater, the sprinter who will kill you with grace. That ease of movement is in at own way an act of aggression, telling you always about strength in reserve. Lyles is a hybrid. He moves with wonderful grace, has astonishing efficiency once he gets past his drive phase, up into full flow.\n\nHis weakness is his start, which was again terrible here. Thomson eased away, eating up the air in front of him, his own moment approaching. At which point, something strange happened, the entire field seeming to tense up, to go backwards while moving at preternatural speed. Only Lyles didn't. He has been talking about this for so long, sketching out his legend in plain sight. It took 30 paces to make it real. And from here the future seems wide open.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barney_ronay@theguardian.com", "name": "Barney

It's my second time around and I'm going off with a medal.\"\n\nIn an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85sec, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86sec, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88sec and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91sec.\n\nStarting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern.\n\nHead tucked down through to the 40-metre mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way.\n\nAs Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist.\n\nThere was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters adjusted their starting blocks.\n\nThe lights then went off and the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum, with each sprinter individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag.\n\nThompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart.\n\nLyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks.\n\nThen came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter's beck and call.\n\nThe wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable, while the only sound was that of a helicopter whirring overhead.\n\nThe shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track to the dramatic denouement.\n\nThe photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze.\n\nAsked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt.\n\n\"100 percent,\" he said. \"That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to take it to the 200.\"", "source": {"uri":

I want a sneaker ... Ain't no money in spikes. Even Michael Johnson didn't have a sneaker,\" he told reporters, referring to the U.S. sprinter who won four gold medals.\n\nLyles, who crossed the finish line in 9.79 seconds, used the new personal best moment to place pressure on sportswear giants who have prioritized other sports like basketball and soccer more than lesser known track and field. It's the latest response for Lyles who has felt slighted by the lack of mainstream attention he receives despite being a generational talent. Earlier this year, Lyles signed a lucrative contract extension with Adidas, reportedly the richest in track and field since Usain Bolt's deal with Puma, but he remains outspoken that he and his sport deserve more.\n\n\"America, I told you. I got next!\" he said after winning the event. He re-emphasized that he was the world's fastest man with the first-place finish. It garnered attention from multiple celebrities and sports stars, including former NBA guard Dwyane Wade, who periodically paints his nails like Lyles.\n\nLyles became the first American to win the 100-meter event at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin did it 20 years ago. It was his first of two individual events at the summer Olympics as he looks to become the first since Bolt to win the 100 meter and 200 meter in the same Olympics.\n\nIn the meantime, he is using this moment to create more marketing exposure for himself and the sport itself which has struggled to gain mainstream fandom due to a lack of visibility and commercial infrastructure. The 27-year-old has quickly grown to become one of the most beloved and controversial American sprinters of all time.\n\nAfter he won a gold medal in three events at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest last August, he spoke out about NBA players crowning themselves as world champions. Some of the NBA's stars clapped back on social media. This group includes a few players who watched the Gainesville, Fla., native win the gold medal at Stade de France on Sunday.\n\nRegardless whether he won their respect or not, Lyles continues to make it clear that his sport and its biggest U.S. star deserves more recognition.", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_jackson@sportico.com", "name": "Eric Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportswear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportswear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165283166-e1722807899297.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

On the TV broadcast, it was hard to tell whether Lyles or Jamaica's Kishane Thompson crossed first.\n\nAfter some 30 seconds, it was announced Lyles won in 9.784 seconds to edge out the Jamaican by five-thousandths of a second. The breathtaking race had many wondering what were the specific rules surrounding photo finishes and what counts as crossing the finish line at the Olympics.\n\nThe Olympic rules state, a runner crosses the finish line when their torso crosses, which is different from their head. That's why some runners lean forward when they cross the line, so their torso crosses first.\n\nYes, it is legal for runners to dive across the finish line, but it's dangerous and not much faster than just running those last few steps.\n\nFor example, in ESPN's Sports Science feature about running or sliding in baseball, they found the jump is faster when the runner first takes off, but acceleration actually decreases while they're in the air.\n\nNoah Lyles won Sunday's excruciatingly close sprint to beat Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\nAn Olympic-sized track is 400 meters around, which is just shy of a quarter of a mile.\n\nFour hundred meters, or one lap around a track, equals about a quarter-mile.", "source": {"uri": "firstcoastnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTLV 12 - Jacksonville"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@firstcoastnews.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.firstcoastnews.com/assets/CCT/images/d35b0152-dafd-48d7-b489-74281897a53b/20240804T203034/d35b0152-dafd-48d7-b489-74281897a53b_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

It took 29.47 seconds for him to find out that he actually won.\n\nOnce the closest, tensest men's 100-meter final in modern Olympic history was over, the real drama was only beginning.\n\nThe race was so tight that the man who crossed the line first suspected that he'd finished second. Lyles put a hand on the shoulder of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson to congratulate him. Thompson stared at the Stade de France scoreboard, willing the photo finish to go his way. \"Come on, man!\" he shouted.\n\nSome 70,000 spectators held their breath. In the time it took to crown the winner, Lyles and Thompson could have run 100 meters three more times.\n\nThat was when one of the most advanced scoring systems in any sport on the planet got to work.\n\nTo determine that Lyles had won by a margin of five thousandths of a second, it took three judges, three high-speed cameras -- and a willingness to make the fastest men alive stand around and wait.\n\nDuring those agonizing moments, the runners' fates were in the hands of a team from Omega Timing, which has been responsible for tracking every fraction of a second at the Olympics for nearly a century.\n\nThis year, the company that operates with Swiss precision debuted something called Scan'O'Vision Ultimate, a new ultra-high-speed camera. And on Sunday night, as Lyles and Thompson crossed the finish line at almost exactly the same time, there were two of those cameras positioned to shoot down the finish line from outside the track, while a third sat inside the oval capturing the reverse shot.\n\nEach one of those cameras had a single job: taking 40,000 images per second of a race that would come down to a photo finish.\n\nThe impossible closeness of the race -- barely a tenth of a second separated first and last place -- made it \"a perfect showcase for our technology,\" said Omega CEO Alain Zobrist.\n\nAfter the runners crossed the line, three federation judges worked alongside an operator of each camera. A runner is deemed to have crossed the finish line when his torso breaks the vertical plane rising from it. The judges asked the operators to toggle forward and backward in time until they found the exact instant the winner crossed.\n\nWhile the judges studied the smallest slivers of time, the athletes suffered a test of their patience more exhausting than sprinting 100 meters. In fact, the judges worked for three times as long as the race itself before determining that Lyles had crossed the line in 9.784 -- or 0.005 second faster than Thompson.\n\n\"I wasn't ready to see it,\" Lyles admitted. \"That's the first time I've ever said that in my head.\"\n\nIt is the athletes' job to move as fast as humanly possible. The judges have the opposite job: to go as slowly as they need to, to get the result right.\n\n\"It's not about speed,\" Zobrist said. \"It's about publishing the right results. You double-check, triple-check before you press the enter button\" -- the button pressed by the lead judge that flashes the winner's name on the scoreboard -- \"because there is no going back.\"\n\nToday's sprinters should consider themselves lucky. There was a time when Lyles would've had to wait much longer to learn he'd become a gold medalist. In the 1940s, when the photo finish began, the cameras had actual film in them. After the runners broke the line, photographers had to walk next door to a darkroom to figure out what just happened.\n\n\"It could take up to two hours to know who actually won the race,\" Zobrist said.\n\nElsewhere in today's Olympics, judges turn to decidedly old-school techniques to define the margins between victory and defeat. At Roland Garros, tennis umpires don't use the Hawk-Eye tracking system. Instead, the umpire scampers down to the court, walks over to the line and inspects the dusky red clay for the imprint of a tennis ball.\n\nBut eyeballing won't suffice in races where 0.01 seconds can make all the difference.\n\nIn 2008, Omega's technology revealed that Michael Phelps had beaten the second-place finisher in the 100-meter butterfly by exactly that margin.\n\nAnd on Sunday, that same tech ruled on a race that even the sprinters themselves didn't know who won. In fact, it was functionally impossible for any person, watching with their own eyes, to see who'd captured the title of world's fastest man. The human eye takes about 0.1 seconds to blink. In that time, Omega's cameras capture 400 images.\n\n\"It was hard for me to picture where we were,\" Lyles said of the moment that made him an Olympic icon.\n\nHe didn't have to.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_SA", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omega SA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoreboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoreboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawk-Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/05/600x338/TOPSHOT-ATHLETICS-OLY-PARIS-2024-68_1722854684647_1722854715050.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

It was an incredible finish to the race as Lyles managed to win the gold medal by the barest of margins. The difference between the gold and the silver medal was five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles managed to beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by 0.005 seconds in what was a dramatic photo finish at the Paris Games. Both sprinters were eventually given a rounded-up timing of 9.79 seconds each but what separated the two was .005 difference in their overall timing.\n\nLyles finished with .784 to Thompson's .789 which saw him finish on the top spot on the podium. Thompson led in the majority of the race but it was Lyles' stunning acceleration towards the end which saw him emerge on top, leaving the fans and his fellow competitors in disbelief.\n\nA photo finish is a term often used to describe an incredibly close race where multiple competitors are finishing a particular race at the same time. In such a case, a photo of the athletes crossing the finishing line is examined and observed to determine the winner. Photo finish is used as the naked eye can't catch the action where the difference could be a few milliseconds or even less.\n\nAt the Olympics and all other major events organised by World Athletics, a slit-video system is used when the runners approach the finish line during an event. The slit-video system has the ability to scan an ultra-thin segment of the track with the finish line. It can scan up to 2000 times per second which helps in determining the timing of each athlete crossing the line.\n\nThere are multiple cameras installed to get different angles in case an athlete's view is blocked by another. But it is not only the foot crossing the finishing line that determines the winner. An athlete's torso has to cross the line for the final timing to be registered. The torso or trunk of a person includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back.\n\nDuring the 100m final at the Paris Olympics, it was Thompson who led for the majority of the race and his foot appeared to have hit the finishing line first. However, it was Lyles who took the gold medal as his torso surpassed the finishing line ahead of the Jamaican, handing him a victory by the barest of margins.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_kumar@news9live.com", "name": "Abhishek Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millisecond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pelvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdomen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Noah-Lyles-Getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles admitted though that even he had doubted whether he had clinched the gold.\n\n\"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm gonna be honest, bro, I think you had that one,'\" Lyles said.\n\n\"And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nThe win completes a rollercoaster three years for Lyles, who had left the pandemic-hit Tokyo Olympics in tears after a disappointing campaign, citing his mental health struggles and battles with depression.\n\nThe American is now targeting an Olympic double with victory in the 200m next week.\n\n- Ukraine medal rush -\n\nLyles' win was the sensational final act of another thrilling day in the Olympic athletics arena that saw three gold medals handed out.\n\nIn other action, Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh lived up to her pre-Paris Games billing to win the women's high jump.\n\nThe world champion and world record holder managed a best of 2.00 metres to win on countback from Australia's Nicola Olyslagers.\n\nAnother Australian, Eleanor Patterson, claimed joint bronze with another Ukrainian, Iryna Gerashchenko, both on 1.95m.\n\nIn the men's hammer, Canadian world champion Ethan Katzberg won after unleashing a mammoth heave with his first throw to clinch the gold medal.\n\nThe 22-year-old from British Columbia registered 84.12m with his opening effort to leave his rivals trailing throughout the competition.\n\nThat was four metres further than his nearest rival, Hungary's Bence Halasz, who took silver with a throw of 79.97m. Ukraine's Mykhaylo Kokhan collected bronze with a throw of 79.39m.\n\nElsewhere Sunday, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol eased through the opening round of the women's 400m hurdles to remain on an Olympic collision course.\n\nUS star McLaughlin-Levrone, the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder, cruised through her heat to win in 53.60sec.\n\nBol meanwhile shrugged off the after-effects of her dazzling performance in Saturday's 4x400m mixed relay to coast through her heat in a leading 53.38sec.\n\nAnother mouthwatering duel is looming in the women's 800m, where Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, a silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, is poised for an epic battle with Kenya's 2023 World Champion Mary Moraa on Monday.\n\nHodgkinson delivered an ice-cool performance to win her semi-final in 1min 56.86sec, the fastest time of the round. Moraa advanced after winning her heat in 1:57.86.\n\nIn the opening round of the men's 400m, Britain's Matt Hudson-Smith got his bid for gold off to a smooth start, winning his heat in 44.78sec.\n\nUS sprinter Michael Norman set the early first round pace however with the quickest time, a brisk 44.10sec. Norman's US team-mate Quincy Hall was second-fastest with a time of 44.28sec.\n\nrcw/gj\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"},

I've never seen them kept this long on the start line,' Cram said on BBC Sport's commentary of the race.\n\n'They've been introduced to the crowd, they've had the hero walk-ins, something which Lyles has almost made his own, and we're waiting for something here, but I'm not sure what. This isn't helping the guys, this is too long.'\n\nFormer British hurdler Jackson added: 'I'm looking down at the track to see if there are any issues, any problems, because we know this race was supposed to start at least three minutes ago...\n\n'There doesn't seem to be anything happening.\n\n'This is very frustrating for them because this is the biggest race of the year.'\n\nIn the BBC Sport studio, Lewis - who won gold for Britain at the Sydney Games in 2000, said the athletes had been made to wait 'way too long' for the start of the race.\n\nAsked whether she had seen anything like the delay before, Lewis told BBC Sport: 'No and I have to say that it's a little bit unfair to the athletes themselves.\n\n'You get yourself to that arousal point where you're in the zone, you're absolutely wanting to give everything and then that is just waining slightly, the longer you're left out there.\n\n'This is finite margins we're talking about and that for me was just way too long.'\n\nJessica Ennis-Hill, meanwhile, argued that the delay may actually have made for a more exciting race.\n\n'But then I suppose just look at the times,' the London 2012 hero said in response to Lewis' comments.\n\n'That wait and that adrenaline we felt, they felt it too and it produced a fantastic face.'\n\nSpeaking shortly after his sensational win, Lyles said he had to take each round as it came after underwhelming showings in the heats and in the semi-finals.\n\n'I had to take each round as it was. I was a little upset after the first round so I came with the aggression and then after I ran that 9.83, I was like, \"Alright, the aggression, we're done with that\",' he explained.\n\n'My sports therapist said, \"You have to let go, you're holding on... let you and release it!\".\n\n'There's plenty more to come. I hope you guys liked it because I've got a lot more coming.'\n\nMORE : Noah Lyles reveals what he told Kishane Thompson after Olympic 100m photo finish\n\nMORE : Incredible picture shows Noah Lyles won 100m Olympic gold by the very barest of margins", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cram", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colin Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denise Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "50 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-second_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "10-second barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurdling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Ennis-Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Ennis-Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-04-at-22.26.49-7c8d.png?crop=0px%2C63px%2C1907px%2C1002px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

On the glitziest, grandest Olympic stage of all, a showman turned up to win the showcase event.\n\nHe talked a lot of talk, Lyles, but, somehow, walked the walk. His 9.79 seconds was no world record - not even close, obviously. It was no Olympic record - not even close, obviously. At 9.58 and 9.63 seconds respectively, they both belong to the master showman, Usain Bolt.\n\nBut here is why it was one of the greatest runs in an Olympic 100 metres final ... 27-year-old Lyles has never run faster in his life.\n\nGoing beyond what you have ever done before at the most pressurised moment of your sporting career - that is what makes Olympic champions, that is what defines them.\n\nAnd this sort of performance in the most extraordinary of races is all about self-belief, all about confidence, all about bravado.\n\nLyles - from Gainesville, Florida - clearly has all these qualities in abundance. That is why he will be the star of that Netflix documentary.\n\nThat is why, ahead of the race, he was dancing down the track when his rivals were composing themselves and politely acknowledging the announcement of their names.\n\nLyles decided to let his adrenaline loose before the crack of the starting pistol. And for a couple of seconds of a race that was described as the best he had ever seen by none other than Michael Johnson, it looked like that bravado would backfire.\n\nBut Lyles has always said he is the best closer in the business, a nerveless finisher. So it proved.\n\nWant to talk about timing? He did not win any of his heats or semi-final. That is what you call timing your run to perfection.\n\nAs Lyles gallivanted around the Stade de France track - waving the paper name-plate that he had tugged from his vest and draped in the US flag - you could spare a thought for send-placed Kishane Thompson, the frighteningly good, young Jamaican, who had been denied by five thousandths of a second.\n\nThat is not even a blink of the eye. But you could spare a thought for every other athlete in this most remarkable of dashes.\n\nHopefully, Louie Hinchcliffe hung around to watch the closest contest in the event's storied history, getting a feel for what should lie ahead for this talented young British sprinter. Hinchcliffe was only 0.04 seconds away from making the final and, considering his inexperience, the University of Houston sprinter and his coach Carl Lewis should be delighted with his campaign in Paris.\n\nBut the standard to which Hinchcliffe has to aspire has been set by Lyles, whose confidence will now be stratospheric heading into the 200 metres and the relay.\n\nAs if it needed a boost.\n\nFor all his talent, Lyles has never had a fraction of the global pull that an athlete such as Bolt had. That is what he longs for. He has wanted to be a worldwide superstar for a long time.\n\nBut to do that, you not only need to be supremely talented and supremely confident - brash, even - you need to deliver iconic, landmark moments.\n\nAnd now, the man with the main-character energy has done just that.\n\nFollow all the action on day 9 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It also cements Lyles as the premier American superstar in this sport as the charismatic 27-year-old sprinter had already been one of the premier faces of track and field with his blazing speed and viral moments.\n\nThompson, who was the betting favorite in the race, took the silver medal and American Fred Kerley took home the bronze.\n\nIt was a sterling version of the signature Olympic race. Taking place on the same night as the women's high jump final and the men's hammer throw final, along with qualifying heats in multiple other races, the showpiece event didn't begin until all those other competitions were done for the day.\n\nWhen the time came, the lights went out in the Stade de France just as the sun had nearly set outside Paris. And then it lit back up as wristbands on the 80,000 spectators in the stadium began to flash, creating another one of the dazzling light shows that these Paris Olympics are becoming known for.\n\nDrama and theater on show in Saint-Denis\n\nEach competitor received an introduction, but Lyles took it like no other, bounding nearly halfway down the track to hype up the crowd and let off a little emotion. Lyles has gone viral in the past for such pre-race moves like pulling out Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before key races, but this time it was only his energy on display.\n\nWhen all the competitors had entered the track, they stood waiting for what felt like an eternity as dramatic music played throughout the stadium.\n\nEventually, the music stopped and the competitors settled into the starting blocks. The stadium fell completely silent - tens of thousands and all one could hear was the wind - before the horn sounded. A mighty roar cut the tension as the sprinters hung together in a tight pack through the first 50 meters of the race.\n\nThere was some separation in the back half of the less-than-10-second contest - the first 100-meter Olympic final in which running a 10-second qualifying heat would not guarantee passage to the final race and the first where every competitor ran sub-10 seconds with a legal wind, according to World Athletics - but not nearly enough for it to be clear who won when the runners crossed the finish line.\n\nThe pack of panting sprinters gathered at the northeastern bend in the track, doubled over catching their breath while they stared up at the big screen, waiting for results. For a while, it only read \"Photo,\" indicating a photo finish.\n\nAnd then the update came through: Lyles had done it.\n\nHe took off again, bounding around the track in ecstasy.", "source": {"uri": "eastidahonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Idaho News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kalama_hines@eastidahonews.com", "name": "Kalama Hines", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Athletics_Championships_\u2013_Men's_hammer_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's hammer throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_high_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's high jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_blocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting blocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/lyles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

At the end of the race, not even the athletes knew who had won. There was doubt as to whether it was him or Jamaican athlete Kisame Thompson, who won silver. The bronze went to USA's Fred Kerley.\n\nNoah Lyles and Kishan Thompson ran in the same hundredth of a second. The American was five thousandths of a second faster and with that he took the gold. He is a great star of athletics, he encourages the spectacle that surrounds the race, but he also has the mentality to win in the race that is not his great speciality, which is the 200m.\n\nThompson didn't get off to the best start, but he did excel for much of the race. Lyles leaned more on his chest as he crossed the finish line, as could be seen in the photo finish. Before seeing that image that clarified the gold and silver medals, the two athletes waited for the result to appear on the screen. They did not know who had won.\n\nThe official time for both of them is 9.79. It is a personal best for Lyles, who becomes the new sprint king. Thompson made a great impression in the semi-finals, and the work he has done has earned him the silver medal.\n\nFred Kerley, Lyles' compatriot, was very close to them. He clocked 9.81, his best time of the season, earning him the bronze medal. He had to be that fast because the race was very evenly matched.\n\nSouth Africa's Akani Simbine broke his country's record, but his time of 9.82 only secured him fourth place. The same happened to Letsile Tebogo, who broke the Botswana record and finished sixth with a time of 9.86.\n\nFifth was Marcell Jacobs, the Italian who caused a surprise at Tokyo 2020 by winning gold in the 100m and the 4x100 relay. He clocked 9.85, the best time this season. With 9.80 in Tokyo he would not have won, but he would have taken the bronze.\n\nUkraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins gold in the High Jump\n\nThe final started with the bar set at 1.86m. To begin with, an injury. Brazil's Valdivia Martins, just as she was running to the mat, felt a puncture and withdrew. Incidentally, Ethiopia's Ekhal Ekwam was also injured in the last heat of the men's 400m in the middle of the race. On a day where we have seen the bitter tears of Carolina Marin in badminton after breaking her knee again.\n\nSoon the list of finalists still competing for the medals was reduced. And the final sieve came at 1.95, as only two jumpers made it higher. It came down to a battle between Ukraine and Australia.\n\nBased on the number of failures, the best athletes among those who cleared 1.95 meters were Ukraine's Iryna Gerashchenko and Australia's Eleanor Patterson. They were tied, so both took the bronze medal.\n\nThe bar was then raised to 2.00 meters, with Ukraine's world record holder Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Australia's Nicola Olyslagers as the only remaining jumpers. The Ukrainian jumped first, followed by the Australian.\n\nAt 2.02m, neither succeeded, so the nulls determined Mahuchikh to be the Olympic champion. It was another step forward in her career, having taken bronze at Tokyo 2020 and won gold at World and European Championships, both outdoors and indoors. The other three medallists achieved the same result at the previous Games.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But I was wondering what we were waiting for, not gonna lie.\n\n'But, in the meantime, the crowd were constantly getting more and more hyped. It didn't feel as if it was completely dead.'\n\nKerley, who was also in the press conference with Lyles, shrugged and added: 'We didn't see nothing.'\n\nThompson also shook his head when asked if he had seen any commotion before the start of the race.\n\nIt has not been officially confirmed that the track invader was the reason behind the delay.\n\nFormer Team GB hurdler Colin Jackson said during the BBC's coverage of the race: 'I'm looking down at the track to see if there are any issues, any problems, because we know this race was supposed to start at least three minutes ago. There doesn't seem to be anything happening.\n\n'This is very frustrating for them because this is the biggest race of the year.'\n\nDenise Lewis, who won gold in the heptathlon at Sydney 2000, also said during the BBC's coverage: 'I have to say that it's a little bit unfair to the athletes themselves.\n\n'You get yourself to that arousal point where you're in the zone, you're absolutely wanting to give everything and then that is just waning slightly, the longer you're left out there.\n\n'This is the finite margins we're talking about and that for me was just way too long.'\n\nMORE : Convicted rapist Steven van de Velde in tears as he's booed out of Paris Olympics\n\nMORE : Olympic organisers slammed for nervy delay before Noah Lyles' 100m final victory", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_davie@metro.co.uk", "name": "Chris Davie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_blocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting blocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurdling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heptathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denise Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEI_215878148-df9e.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=93px%2C68px%2C2158px%2C1133px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Twenty years after Justin Gatlin's gold medal in Athens 2004, Noah Lyles has won in a race so close that it was necessary to wait for the photo finish to know the winner. There were only 12 hundredths of a second between the first and the last, with all of them under 10 seconds, something that had never happened before in a race with legal wind.\n\nLyles, with 1.0 downwind, overtook the Jamaican Kishane Thompson on the finish line, but nobody celebrated until after a few seconds, waiting for a result that ruled that the three-time world champion in Budapest 2023 -100, 200 and 4x100- had been five thousandths faster than the new West Indian jewel.\n\n9.79 (.784) for the American -personal record-, the greatest icon of world speed since the retirement of Usain Bolt, and 9.79 (.789) for Thompson. Third was Fred Kerley, world gold medalist in Eugene 2022, with 9.81, ahead of South African Akani Simbine (9.82) and the previous Olympic champion, Italian Marcel Jacobs (9.85), who ended up limping and with a bandage on his left leg.\n\nYou have to go back to Moscow 1980, the Games that the United States boycotted, to see the top two in the same hundredth. Back then, when there were no tiebreaker thousandths, the British Allan Wells won with 10.25, followed by Cuban Silvio Leonard. An image then showed that Wells had crossed the finish line 76 millimeters earlier.\n\nLyles, who in these Games will be looking for a second gold in the 200m and even assault Bolt's world record, is the first sprinter to repeat the 100m crown in two consecutive major competitions since the retirement of the Jamaican giant.\n\nThompson, who arrived in the Parisian capital as the fastest athlete of the year thanks to his 9.77 achieved on June 28 at the Jamaican trials, will have to settle for a silver that will not have left him very satisfied.Especially because in the semifinals, held two hours earlier, he had been the fastest (9.80) followed by his compatriot Oblique Seville (9.81), who in the final did not live up to expectations and finished last with 9.91.\n\nA penultimate round in which up to 12 athletes went under 10 seconds, among them the Canadian Andre De Grasse, bronze medalist in the last two Games, who was one of the four who did not advance to the final.Never before had an

American sprinter Noah Lyles proved the point on Sunday, August 4, on the purple track of the Stade de France, when he won his first Olympic title in the 100 m by a paltry margin of five thousandths of a second (9.784 seconds to 9.789 seconds) over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson.\n\n\"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" said Fred Kerley, the American silver medallist at the Tokyo Games in 2021 and 100 m world champion in 2022, who took third place (9.81). Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs, the surprise Olympic champion in 2021, who came fifth (9.85), was visibly disappointed and kept a low profile.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" a laughing and very talkative Lyles told reporters. \"I went up to him afterward, while we were waiting. I even said, 'Bro I think you got that one, big dog,' and then my name popped up and I'm like, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm amazing!'\" Only the photo finish - based on the frontmost point of the athletes' torsos as they leaned into the finish line - could separate Lyles, 27, from Thompson, 23.\n\nHis victory in the 100 m event enables the Floridian sprinter with painted nails and braided hair adorned with pearls to extend his daring gamble. The author of a 100 m, 200 m and 4 \u00d7 100 m hat-trick at the World Championships in Budapest in 2023, he has raised the bar for Paris 2024 and is aiming for an unprecedented quadruple in the 100 m, 200 m, 4 \u00d7 100 m and 4 \u00d7 400 m events. He is hoping for gold in every event, he said on Sunday.\n\nThe first of those challenges was far from easy. Beaten in the heats on Saturday, August 3, by Britain's Louie Hinchcliffe (9.98 vs. 10.4), while Thompson won his heat in 10 seconds after easing off after 60 meters, Lyles admitted he had been schooled for his very first Olympic 100 m.\n\n\"I guess that's my first lesson in underestimating the power of an Olympics,\" he blamed himself. \"When someone's on the line they say they're going to give their all or nothing, now (...) I'm ready to go.\" In Sunday's semi-final, however, he was only second-fastest (9.83) behind Jamaica's Oblique Seville (9.81).\n\nAn hour or so later, he was beaming at the start of the final. Without even looking at his highly concentrated opponents, the born showman bounced around and asked the crowd to make noise. The organizers had spared no expense in staging the event, plunging the stadium into darkness to let it be illuminated by the multi-colored LED bracelets distributed to the 75,000 spectators.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "60 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/08/04/160/0/7430/3715/1440/720/60/0/0c77505_5313374-01-06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 123, "textEnd": 131}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1646, "textEnd": 1654}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

We have fun quizzes! Explore our new quiz section!\n\nOn a warm Sunday evening in Paris, beneath the iconic lights of the Olympic Stadium, Noah Lyles claimed the title of the fastest man alive.\n\nHis victory, marked by a finish time of 9.784 seconds, represented more than just a record-breaking sprint -- it was a triumph over a lifetime of challenges.\n\nLyles is renowned for his vibrant personality and his tendency to wear his emotions on his sleeve.\n\nBefore the opening ceremony, he boldly wrote \"ICON\" on his nails, embodying both his confidence and his commitment, per the Washington Post.\n\nWhat many don't see, however, are the personal struggles he has faced.\n\nHe has channelled these challenges into motivation, offering inspiration to anyone who needs it.\n\nLyles, the newly crowned 100-meter champion, took to social media not to boast but to inspire. His message was simple yet powerful: obstacles do not define you.\n\n\"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become.

Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them. I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles admitted though that even he had doubted whether he had clinched the gold.\n\n\"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm gonna be honest, bro, I think you had that one,'\" Lyles said.\n\n\"And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nThe win completes a rollercoaster three years for Lyles, who had left the pandemic-hit Tokyo Olympics in tears after a disappointing campaign, citing his mental health struggles and battles with depression.\n\nThe American is now targeting an Olympic double with victory in the 200m next week.\n\n- Ukraine medal rush - More from this section Australia blames 'serious failures' for lethal Israeli strike on aid convoy Far-right protesters clash with police as UK unrest spreads Nine killed in two Israeli West Bank air strikes\n\nLyles' win was the sensational final act of another thrilling day in the Olympic athletics arena that saw three gold medals handed out.\n\nIn other action, Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh lived up to her pre-Paris Games billing to win the women's high jump.\n\nThe world champion and world record holder managed a best of 2.00 metres to win on countback from Australia's Nicola Olyslagers.\n\nAnother Australian, Eleanor Patterson, claimed joint bronze with another Ukrainian, Iryna Gerashchenko, both on 1.95m.\n\nIn the men's hammer, Canadian world champion Ethan Katzberg won after unleashing a mammoth heave with his first throw to clinch the gold medal.\n\nThe 22-year-old from British Columbia registered 84.12m with his opening effort to leave his rivals trailing throughout the competition.\n\nThat was four metres further than his nearest rival, Hungary's Bence Halasz, who took silver with a throw of 79.97m. Ukraine's Mykhaylo Kokhan collected bronze with a throw of 79.39m.\n\nElsewhere Sunday, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol eased through the opening round of the women's 400m hurdles to remain on an Olympic collision course.\n\nUS star McLaughlin-Levrone, the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder, cruised through her heat to win in 53.60sec.\n\nBol meanwhile shrugged off the after-effects of her dazzling performance in Saturday's 4x400m mixed relay to coast through her heat in a leading 53.38sec.\n\nAnother mouthwatering duel is looming in the women's 800m, where Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, a silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, is poised for an epic battle with Kenya's 2023 World Champion Mary Moraa on Monday.\n\nHodgkinson delivered an ice-cool performance to win her semi-final in 1min 56.86sec, the fastest time of the round. Moraa advanced after winning her heat in 1:57.86.\n\nIn the opening round of the men's 400m, Britain's Matt Hudson-Smith got his bid for gold off to a smooth start, winning his heat in 44.78sec.\n\nUS sprinter Michael Norman set the early first round pace however with the quickest time, a brisk 44.10sec.

Big up to all of them. But I really beat myself today in that I didn't trust myself or my speed to bring myself to the line in the first place.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lyles, who became the first man from the USA to win the event since Justin Gatlin at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece, was ecstatic.\n\n\"I went up to Kishane, and I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, I think you had that one',\" a beaming Lyles told Eurosport after the race. \"I was fully prepared to see his name pop up. and to see my name pop, I'm like, 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was also heartbreak for Jamaica's Shericka Jackson, who was a no-show for the qualifying rounds in the women's 200 metres.\n\nJackson, the two-time reigning 200-metre world champion, came into the Olympics nursing a hamstring injury and pulled out of the event just moments before she was scheduled to run in Heat 3.\n\nThe newly crowned 100-metre champion, Julien Alfred of St Lucia, eased into the next round after comfortably winning her heat.\n\nRunning out of Heat 1, Alfred cruised to victory in 22.41 seconds, well ahead of second-placed Gemima Joseph of France (22.72), while Sweden's Julia Henriksson (22.79) was the other automatic qualifier.\n\nJamaica's Niesha Burgher also booked her spot in the next round after finishing second in Heat 2 in 22.54 seconds, behind Gabrielle Thomas of the USA, who clocked 22.20 to be the fastest qualifier.\n\nFellow Jamaican Lanae-Tava Thomas also advanced, placing second in Heat 5 in a time of 22.70 seconds.\n\nThe Jamaican pair of Carey McLeod and Wayne Pinnock also made it past the first round of qualifying for the men's long jump.\n\nMcLeod leapt 7.90 metres to advance out of Group A, while Pinnock's effort of 7.96 was good enough to qualify from Group B.\n\nTheir teammate, Tajay Gayle, however, was eliminated with a leap of 7.78 metres.\n\nIn the men's 110-metre hurdles, Jamaica's trio of Orlando Bennett, Rasheed Broadbell, Hansle Parchment, and Antoine Andrews of the Bahamas all advanced to the next round of qualifying.\n\nRushell Clayton of Jamaica won her heat in the women's 400-metre hurdles to easily advance, while her teammates Shiann Salmon and Janieve Russell, who finished second and third, respectively, in their heats, also booked their spots in the next round.\n\nKirani James of Grenada expectedly cruised into the second round of the men's 400 metres, clocking 44.78 seconds to comfortably win Heat 5.\n\nAlso advancing in the event were Jamaica's Jevaughn Powell and Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago.", "source": {"uri":

It was a tight race between him and Jamaican sprinter Jishane Thompson when they crossed the finish line. At first glance, it looked like Thompson won the race, but when video replay showed that Lyles was first, it confirmed that the 20-year drought of a U.S. sprinter failing to win gold came to an end.\n\nLyles' reaction was calm and collected, achieving a personal best time of 9.79 seconds as he edged out Thompson by five thousandths of a second.\n\nThis prompted social media to react to the event, particularly the NBA community as Team USA's basketball team was in attendance for the event.\n\nHere are some of the reactions:\n\nRelated: Novak Djokovic Gets Emotional After Making Olympics History en Route to Winning First Gold Medal", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_pereira@postandcourier.com", "name": "Richard Pereira", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them. I'm the wolf amongst wolves.\"\n\nLyles admitted though that even he had doubted whether he had clinched the gold.\n\n\"I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm gonna be honest, bro, I think you had that one,'\" Lyles said.\n\n\"And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.\"\n\nThe win completes a rollercoaster three years for Lyles, who had left the pandemic-hit Tokyo Olympics in tears after a disappointing campaign, citing his mental health struggles and battles with depression.\n\nThe American is now targeting an Olympic double with victory in the 200m next week.\n\n- Ukraine medal rush -\n\nLyles' win was the sensational final act of another thrilling day in the Olympic athletics arena that saw three gold medals handed out.\n\nIn other action, Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh lived up to her pre-Paris Games billing to win the women's high jump.\n\nThe world champion and world record holder managed a best of 2.00 metres to win on countback from Australia's Nicola Olyslagers.\n\nAnother Australian, Eleanor Patterson, claimed joint bronze with another Ukrainian, Iryna Gerashchenko, both on 1.95m.\n\nIn the men's hammer, Canadian world champion Ethan Katzberg won after unleashing a mammoth heave with his first throw to clinch the gold medal.\n\nThe 22-year-old from British Columbia registered 84.12m with his opening effort to leave his rivals trailing throughout the competition.\n\nThat was four metres further than his nearest rival, Hungary's Bence Halasz, who took silver with a throw of 79.97m. Ukraine's Mykhaylo Kokhan collected bronze with a throw of 79.39m.\n\nElsewhere Sunday, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol eased through the opening round of the women's 400m hurdles to remain on an Olympic collision course.\n\nUS star McLaughlin-Levrone, the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder, cruised through her heat to win in 53.60sec.\n\nBol meanwhile shrugged off the after-effects of her dazzling performance in Saturday's 4x400m mixed relay to coast through her heat in a leading 53.38sec.\n\nAnother mouthwatering duel is looming in the women's 800m, where Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, a silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, is poised for an epic battle with Kenya's 2023 World Champion Mary Moraa on Monday.\n\nHodgkinson delivered an ice-cool performance to win her semi-final in 1min 56.86sec, the fastest time of the round. Moraa advanced after winning her heat in 1:57.86.\n\nIn the opening round of the men's 400m, Britain's Matt Hudson-Smith got his bid for gold off to a smooth start, winning his heat in 44.78sec.\n\nUS sprinter Michael Norman set the early first round pace however with the quickest time, a brisk 44.10sec.

Ukraine's Mykhaylo Kokhan collected bronze with a throw of 79.39m.\n\nElsewhere Sunday, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol eased through the opening round of the women's 400m hurdles to remain on an Olympic collision course.\n\nUS star McLaughlin-Levrone, the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder, cruised through her heat to win in 53.60sec.\n\nBol meanwhile shrugged off the after-effects of her dazzling performance in Saturday's 4x400m mixed relay to coast through her heat in a leading 53.38sec.\n\nAnother mouthwatering duel is looming in the women's 800m, where Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, a silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, is poised for an epic battle with Kenya's 2023 World Champion Mary Moraa on Monday.\n\nHodgkinson delivered an ice-cool performance to win her semi-final in 1min 56.86sec, the fastest time of the round.

Some NBA stars slammed Lyles' comments, while others, including sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson, supported his perspective. Lyles' outspoken nature isn't new, having previously stirred controversy with his bold statements, leaving a mark in the sports world.\n\nAmerican track star Noah Lyles caused controversy in a press conference in 2023 by claiming that NBA stars do not deserve to be called world champions due to the fact that only American teams play in the league, and those comments are what has led to many Americans disliking the athlete.\n\nIn a press conference last year, the 27-year-old said: \"You know the thing that hurts me the most? I have to watch the NBA Finals, and they have 'world champion' on their heads. World champion of what? The United States? Don't get me wrong. I love the US at times, but that ain't the world. That is not the world - we are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving and putting on a flag to show that they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA. We got to do more. We got to be presented to the world. I love the track community, but we can only do so much within our own bubble. There's a whole world out there.\"\n\nReaction to Noah Lyles' World Champions Comment\n\nLyle's comments, unsurprisingly, did not go down well with many within the NBA. A backlash was led by Kevin Durant, with the two-time MVP responding to his claims by posting on his X account: \"Somebody help this brother out.\" Draymond Green, a four-time world champion of the sport, also responded by saying on Instagram: \"When smart goes wrong.\"\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Key Statistic: The 100m final at the Paris Olympics was the first time ever that every athlete ran under 10 seconds.\n\nNBA journalist Stephen A Smith, meanwhile, said: \"The NBA currently features 120 players from 40 countries and six continents on its roster for last season, and it's increased now. So how is that not global? How is that not the world champions? The best players from around the world descend upon America to join the National Basketball Association. The international players, rather than electing to stay in their respective countries ... to play basketball, they want to come to the NBA because it's the best basketball league on the planet.\"\n\nLyle's comments did receive some support, however. Fellow sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson said: \"I'm standing with Noah on this one. The organisation [NBA] have players from different countries, but do they compete against different countries? You have to go against the world in order to be a world champion.\"\n\nMen's 100m final\n\nPosition\n\nAthlete\n\nCountry\n\nTime\n\n1.\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nUSA\n\n9.79\n\n2.\n\nKishane Thompson\n\nJAM\n\n9.79\n\n3.\n\nFred Kerley\n\nUSA\n\n9.81\n\n4.\n\nAkani Simbine\n\nRSA\n\n9.82\n\n5.\n\nLamont Jacobs\n\nITA\n\n9.85\n\n6.\n\nLetsile Tebogo\n\nBOT\n\n9.86\n\n7.\n\nKenneth Bednarek\n\nUSA\n\n9.88\n\n8.\n\nOblique Seville\n\nJAM\n\n9.91\n\nPeople from outside sport have also applauded the comments, with television personality Piers Morgan saying via X: \"The cojones of this guy calling out NBA stars for pretending to be world champions - when they're not! - then beating the world to be Olympic 100m champion - are gigantic. Congrats @LylesNoah you talked the talked and just walked the walk.\"\n\nNoah Lyles' Controversial History\n\nThis isn't the first time that comments from Lyles have caused controversy. At the World Championships last year, he took aim at his own sport by criticising previous champions, including Usain Bolt, who retired in 2017: \"As I look around this World Championships, I don't see Bolt, I don't see Asafa (Powell). I don't see Yohan (Blake) and he's still running. Where are all these great champions? We look at them, as we're walking through the tunnel, at all of these previous world champions.

However, he said that missing out on the ultimate prize was a matter of impatience.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and with myself so I could let my speed bring me at the line in the position that I know I could have. But I have learned from it,\" Thompson said.\n\nBefore yesterday, Jamaica's men had not won an Olympic medal in the 100m event since 2016 when Usain Bolt claimed gold in 9.81 seconds over American Justin Gatlin (9.89) and Canadian Andre De Grasse (9.91). Also, no Jamaican male had won a major global medal of any kind since the 2017 World Championships when Bolt won bronze in 9.95 seconds. Gatlin won in 9.92 ahead of countryman Christian Coleman (9.94).\n\nDespite being edged to the line, Thompson was reflective on how far he has come, given his injury woes of the past.\n\n\"I am feeling super grateful. I know that my body language doesn't show but I am super grateful. I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold. Everybody loves a winner. I would have loved to win today (yesterday),\" Thompson said.\n\nLyles, who captured America's first Olympic title since 2004, acknowledged the significance of his victory.\n\n\"It was a crazy moment because I thought that Kishane had that and I was like, I really am going to have to swallow my pride, which I don't have a problem doing. Respect is respect,\" Lyles said. \"Everybody in the field came out knowing that they can win this race. When I saw my name it was like I didn't do this against a slow crowd, I did this against the best of the best.\"\n\nEarlier in the morning, Jamaica had its third consecutive withdrawal as Shericka Jackson did not face the starter for the women's 200m. Jackson's fitness was in question leading up to the Games and she had already opted out of the 100m. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was also withdrawn from the women's 100m semi-finals.\n\nIn the women's 200m first round, Lanae-Tava Thomas (22.70) and Niesha Burgher (22.54) progressed to this afternoon's semi-finals with second-place finishes in their respective heats. Gabby Thomas (22.20) was the fastest in first-round action.\n\nMeanwhile, World Championships silver medallist Wayne Pinnock (7.96m) and World Indoor Championship bronze medallist Carey McLeod (7.90m) advanced to the final of the men's long jump.

He was just 0.16 seconds of breaking the legendary Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63s.\n\nArmed not just with lightning-fast legs, but also with the unwavering spirit, Noah has proved that he is more than just a sprinter -- he is a symbol of resilience.\n\nHe had a bad start and did not lead at any point in the race. Only until the final stride, he paced up, as though running for life and clinched the gold by winning by fraction of a second.\n\nThe race was so close that every runner finished the race in 9 seconds and seven of the eight sprinters saw \"PHOTO\" next to their name on the large scoreboard inside the Stade de France. The term indicates a closer inspection of the finish is required. In this case, the timing was extended to the thousandth of a second to determine the winner. In the end, it was declared that Noah had 0.005s ahead of Kishane to finish at the top of the podium. Lyles finished in 9.784 seconds and Thompson in 9.789.\n\nIn that moment, the world was watching as he celebrated, draping the American flag around his shoulders. He looked into the crowd with a beaming smile and shouted, \"America, I told you, I got this!\" It was a declaration not just of victory but of perseverance, a loud message echoing to anyone who had ever felt different or faced obstacles.\n\nAfter the awe-inspiring run with a over a million motivations Lyles' victory resonated far beyond the track. He took to Twitter, sharing a heartfelt message to his followers: \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\" His words struck a chord, inspiring countless individuals who grappled with their shadows.\n\nNoah's journey to Olympic gold was not simply about breaking records in the sport; it was about breaking barriers in life. He faced criticism and skepticism along the way, particularly after stirring the pot with bold comments about the world of sports. Yet, in that Olympic moment, every doubt transformed into a testament of his character.\n\nHis triumph served not only as a personal victory but a collective celebration for all those who dare to challenge their limits. Lyles had become an emblem of hope, showcasing that greatness can emerge from struggle.\n\nAfter giving 9 million reasons fo motivation through his win, Noah has already become a legend.\n\nAs the sun set over Paris, Noah Lyles stood atop the podium, gold medal glistening against his chest, a symbol of what is possible when you refuse to be defined by your challenges. The applause and cheers of the crowd surged through him, and he understood the significance of his win: it wasn't just his victory, but a victory for all who dare to dream against the odds. From that day forward, he became not just a champion on the track but a beacon of hope -- reminding everyone, \"Why not you?\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/ATHLETICS-OLY-PARIS-2024-233_1722827767913_1722827800630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Jacobs clocked a time of 9.85, while finishing fifth.\n\nKerley, Lyles, and Kenny Bednarik (7th place, 9.88) will return to the track later this week, and will try to give the United States 4x100m Relay team its first gold medal since the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nThis week's relays could also include Ghanan sprinter Benjamin Azamati, who recently finished a historic career at West Texas A&M. Azamati finished ninth in his heat during Sunday afternoon's 100m semifinals, unable to advance.\n\nThe Olympic journey for Red Raider runner Antoine Andrews, who represents the Bahamas, is off to a positive start. In Sunday's first round of the Men's 110m Hurdles, Andrews was on the better side of a photo finish, along with three others who crossed the line at 13.43 (only .03 behind Zhuoyi Xu of China). Andrews was the best of the four, and he finished second in the overall heat, well enough to earn a spot in Wednesday's semifinals. If the outcome hadn't worked in his favor, Andrews would've had a second and final chance in Tuesday's repechage round.\n\nCoverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics can be seen on KCBD-TV and Peacock and

Noah Lyles, Kishane Thompson, Marcell Jacobs... here is a review of the contenders for a very open race.\n\nWith Usain Bolt no longer on the track, the men's 100m is still on the look for a new undisputed king. It could very well be the Americans, particularly 27-year-old Noah Lyles. At the recent Budapest World Championships, Lyles won the 100 m, 200 m and 4x100 m in a resounding hat-trick of victories. In Paris, he'll even be aiming for a quadruple with the 4x400m as a bonus.\n\nAnother US runner to watch out for is Fred Kerley, world champion in 2022 and silver medallist in the Tokyo Games, who is back in form at just the right time.\n\nBehind these two arrows from the other side of the Atlantic, a number of men are taking on the role of challenger. There are, of course, the Jamaicans: Kishane Thompson, the new 22-year-old nugget who just clocked the best performance of the year in 9'77 in June, and 23-year-old Oblique Seville, who already beat Noah Lyles in June.\n\nAnd behind them, we also find African athletes. Botswanan prodigy Letsile Tebogo, aged just 21, became the first African to medal in the 100 m at last year's World Championships in Budapest, where he took silver. He is joined by Kenya's Ferdinand Omanyala, African record-holder in 9'77, who has the distinction of being licensed in France, in Miramas (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne).\n\nLast but not least, we'll be keeping a close eye on Italian Marcell Jacobs, the 29-year-old defending champion. After two injury-plagued seasons, he's back in form and was crowned European champion in June. To the disappointment of the home crowd, for the first time since 1932, no Frenchman has qualified for this distance this year.\n\n(L'\u00c9quipe)", "source": {"uri": "theweek.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Omanyala", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Omanyala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miramas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miramas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Masters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Masters", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/news/sports/images/2024/8/2/Sprint kings Marcell Jacobs L and Noah Lyles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

I went up to him after, while we were waiting, and I even said 'I think you've got that, good going,' and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing'.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it (his name) and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it.\n\n\"He was quite a few lanes down, he was in four, I was in seven so it was hard for me to picture where we were.\"\n\nThe American world 100m and 200m champion's triumph comes three summers after he entered the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the 200m favourite and world champion - but only claimed bronze.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about a lifelong battle with depression and the challenges of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform - ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nEarlier this week, he acknowledged he performs better in front of a full house, remembering the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself \"it's showtime\", but instead found himself thinking \"this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.\"\n\nLyles had no such trouble in Paris, where he thumped his chest at the start line and pumped up the electrified crowd, clearly revelling in the occasion, before they fell so quiet at the start of the race that it was possible to hear a plane passing overhead.\n\nThen the man whose weakness is often said to be his starts got off to the joint slowest, an 0.178 reaction time alongside Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nLyles, only learning that fact from a journalist, said: \"Slowest reaction time - that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nHe entered these Olympics with the third-fastest time at 100m this year behind Thompson's world-leading 9.77 and Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala's 9.79, and as a result found himself in a position of needing to back up his signature bravado on Sunday night.\n\nThompson qualified fastest of the semi-finalists in 9.80, his compatriot Seville Oblique just behind him in a personal-best 9.81 and Lyles two hundredths of a second behind.\n\nOblique was the only man who did not have to wait for his place to be confirmed - the last-placed man in 9.91.\n\nLyles is in Paris with a point to prove, embroiled in a debate before the Games about who was currently fastest man on the planet - not that he ever had any doubts.\n\nThe Floridian - who is looking to do the double in the 200 metres - emphatically reiterated his answer, this time with his feet instead of his rhetoric.\n\nHinchliffe said: \"It was a good experience, not the result that I wanted. Definitely a lot to learn. I haven't seen the race back.\n\n\"I am disappointed. The time is OK but it's where I finished in the race. I will come back stronger next year. I will not regress. It's my first year on the scene. There is a lot more to come.\n\n\"Definitely, definitely LA, I will be there (in the final). Next year as well. There are a lot of world championships between then and now. There is a lot of time.\n\nHughes has another chance to try for a first Olympic medal when the men's 200m heats begin on Monday.\n\nHe said: \"I am a fighter. I am very determined and that's why I wanted to give it a go. I got the training in but the races is what I needed to get me race sharp.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antidepressant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand II of Aragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/04/23/eead7d7271a7f60051459103cdbfbf30Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIyODk0NTk0-2.77062527.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Music played with the likes of Kishane Thompson and Tokyo gold-medalist Marcell Jacobs in addition to Lyles left to try and keep themselves warm and retain their composure.\n\nThere were no issues apparent that forced the delay, but Jackson believes it would have been a frustrating moments for sprinters. Certainly, the veteran commentator appeared frustrated on their behalf.\n\n\"I'm looking down the track to see if there's any issues,\" he said. \"This race was supposed to go off three minutes ago. This is very frustrating for them.\"\n\nRegardless the 100m finalists appeared up to the task. From one-to-eight it was a rapid race that left former Olympic champion heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill impressed as her colleagues discussed the delay.\n\n\"Look at the times,\" she said. \"That wait and adrenaline we all felt, they all felt it and look at the race they ran.\"\n\nLyles put in a sterling performance to record a personal best time of 9.79 ahead of Jamaica star Thompson. Compatriot Fred Kerley earned bronze in 9.81.\n\nFourth-placed Akani Simbine recorded 9.82, a South African national record, while sixth place Letsile Tebogo also recorded a national record in 9.86.\n\nIn addition, the race saw a world record for a fourth-placed finish, a world record for fifth, a world record for sixth, a world record for seventh and a world record for for eighth.\n\nJackson could not deny what he saw. Speaking after the race he said: \"Incredible times. The fastest 100m we have ever witnessed when it comes to performances!\n\n\"Noah Lyles is heading to the very top of that list. Incredible performance from him. Just five thousandths of a second has made Lyles leap into the history books. This is just so exceptional.\"\n\nMichael Johnson declared it the best race he had ever witnessed in the event. \"Absolutely, bar none,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It was so open, there were so many great athletes. It lived up to it, we had this amazing race where you could throw a blanket over the finishing line. We didn't even know who won for a few minutes.\"\n\nFollow all the action on day seven of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\" Lyles posted on Sunday evening (early Monday morning in Paris).\n\nLyles crossed the finish line in 9.79784 seconds, a personal best. When the result was official, he had seven words: \"America, I told you, I got this!\" Amazingly, he was tied for the worst reaction time, and he was even in last place at the 40-meter mark.\n\nIt was the fifth gold medal won by Americans on Sunday (golfer Scottie Scheffler, cyclist Kristen Faulkner, swimmer Bobby Finke and the women's 4x100 medley relay team).\n\nSIMONE BILES REVEALS 1 QUESTION THAT'S 'REALLY GOTTA STOP' BEING ASKED TO OLYMPIC ATHLETES\n\nLyles now turns his focus on the 200-meter (he's said his \"dream goal\" is to break Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19) and the 4x100-meter relay.\n\nTrack legend Carl Lewis recently told Fox News Digital that the sport \"needs\" Lyles to dominate these games.\n\n\"I think the sport needs someone like him that's a champion. He's the defending champion, the fastest man in the world right now, and we need someone to grab onto.

That's why I think if Noah were to win, he would elevate the sport as well. As opposed to saying, 'I wonder who's going to win,' people want to say, 'I want him' or 'I don't want him.' They want to root for someone or root against someone. I think it creates more intensity when you have someone that dominates, and that's been throughout history. ...

At first glance, the chain-linked piece of jewelry looks studded with diamonds and is made out of three different types of metal. Lyles has a penchant for fancy jewels, be it necklaces or rings, so we can expect him to wear even more bling in the future. Here are more details on the necklace Noah Lyles wore at the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nWhat is the Noah Lyles necklace made out of?\n\nThe necklace Noah Lyles wore during his gold medal-winning 100m sprint looks to made out of white metal with mariner links that are adorned with three types of gemstones. He has also worn this linked chain in the past, specifically during the 100-meter dash at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\nFrom what we can assume, the chain is mostly out of some kind of white metal alloy, which is typically platinum, white gold, silver, or another gray metal when it comes to jewelry. The mariner links, which refer to the large oval chains used to anchor ships, are each separated by a line. The chain itself is worn very close to Lyles' neck, so that it doesn't hang or flop around while he is sprinting. The jewels themselves look to be diamonds, alternating between yellow, black, and white varieties of the stone, done in pav\u00e9, which is a way of setting diamonds on metal so that they cover most of the metal.\n\nInterestingly, though, Lyles hasn't said much about what his necklace is specifically made out of nor who is responsible for creating it. It's possible that the chain is a piece of custom jewelry made by The Village Jeweler, which is based in Gainesville, Florida. In a Facebook post in 2021, the company posted pictures of Lyles wearing a ring with rose gold accents and gemstones representing the Olympic rings. The jeweler also posted a 2021 TikTok video of Lyles speaking with GQ about a custom rose gold and diamond Cuban link necklace he purchased from its store.\n\nAt any rate, this chain-link necklace has become something of a good luck charm for Noah Lyles. So we might see it again when he races in other track and field events in future championships.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_tan@comingsoon.net", "name": "Nicholas Tan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gemstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Costume", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Costume", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Diamonds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Diamonds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/noah-lyles-necklace-diamond-jewelry-chain-link.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.\"\n\nLyles had no such trouble in Paris, where he thumped his chest at the start line and pumped up the electrified crowd, clearly revelling in the occasion, before they fell so quiet at the start of the race that it was possible to hear a plane passing overhead.\n\nThen the man whose weakness is often said to be his starts got off to the joint slowest, an 0.178 reaction time alongside Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nLyles, only learning that fact from a journalist, said: \"Slowest reaction time - that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nHe entered these Olympics with the third-fastest time at 100m this year behind Thompson's world-leading 9.77 and Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala's 9.79, and as a result found himself in a position of needing to back up his signature bravado on Sunday night.\n\nThompson qualified fastest of the semi-finalists in 9.80, his compatriot Seville Oblique just behind him in a personal-best 9.81 and Lyles two hundredths of a second behind.\n\nOblique was the only man who did not have to wait for his place to be confirmed - the last-placed man in 9.91.\n\nLyles is in Paris with a point to prove, embroiled in a debate before the Games about who was currently fastest man on the planet - not that he ever had any doubts.\n\nThe Floridian - who is looking to do the double in the 200 metres - emphatically reiterated his answer, this time with his feet instead of his rhetoric.", "source": {"uri": "dailyecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Southern Daily Echo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antidepressant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand II of Aragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/resources/images/18384978/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

He can talk for life,\" wrote Hart.\n\nThe question of whether an NBA team can be considered a \"world\" champion is one that doesn't really have a clear answer. As previously noted, most of the best players from countries outside of the United States tend to opt to play in the NBA, and it is highly, highly unlikely that any team comprised of non-NBA players would be able to keep it within 30 against the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics, let alone beat them.\n\nHowever, the Olympics are the closest thing we have to determining a true \"world\" champion, and Lyles cemented himself as such on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trey Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Did-Josh-Hart-just-take-a-shot-at-Noah-Lyles-before-his-gold-medal-performance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

He tapped into his prime and delivered his personal best performance in front of a jam-packed crowd at the Stade de France.\n\nIn a race that separated the gold and the silver medallists by a matter of milliseconds, Noah emerged victorious and became the fastest man in the men's 100m final.\n\nIn a race that wrapped up within a blink of an eye, Noah clocked of 9.784s to walk away with the gold. He was just 0.16 seconds of breaking the legendary Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63s.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson settled for silver after falling short by a fraction of a second in one of the closest 100m races in the history of the Summer Games. Noah's compatriot Fred Kerley clinched the bronze medal with his season-best timing of 9.81s.\n\nFollowing his triumph, Noah became the first United States athlete to bag a gold since Justin Gatlin stood at the top of the podium in 2004 in the 100m race.\n\nAthletes had to wait for some time for the results as all eight sprinters participating in the event were separated by the tiniest of the margins for the gold medal.\n\nIn the end, it was declared that Noah had 0.005s ahead of Kishane to finish at the top of the podium. Following the announcement, the crowd erupted in a roar and went berserk, applauding the American sprinter for his remarkable triumph. He ripped his name from his shirt and held it high in the air.\n\nSouth Africa's Akane Simbine once again missed out on a podium finish by a whisker as he finished fourth. In the Tokyo and Rio Olympics, Simbine was close but fell short of getting his hands on an Olympic medal in the event.\n\nNoah won the 100m and 200m in last year's World Championships. After securing gold in the 100m, he will look to seal his second gold at Paris in the 200m race event.

Even Michael Johnson didn't have a sneaker.\"\n\n\"He is recognising that he is beginning to transcend the sport, which is really what we want them all to do,\" Coe said.\n\nParticularly impressive in Lyles' performance was that the 27-year-old did not look best in the semifinal less than two hours earlier.\n\nAlso read | Noah Lyles wins 100m final: How is a photo finish decided in Olympics?\n\n\"Like all great individuals in sport and great teams, they tend when it really matters to find a way of winning, and that's what he did last night. He was never ahead in that race until the last frame of that photo,\" Coe said.\n\n\"What he probably mastered better than anybody else, was what was in his head for an hour and 40-something minutes between the semi and the final.\"\n\nHad Sunday's sprint final been a swimming race, Lyles and silver medallist Kishane Thompson would have shared gold, since swimming times only go to the hundredth of a second.\n\n\"If you have the technology, you have to use it,\" Coe said. \"Metrology is a very clear and definite science, and you need to make sure that if you have that technology, you use it.\n\n\"You speak to my kids or younger, they're not fazed by the fact that somebody got across the line in five thousands of a second, they think it's rather cool actually.\"\n\nAthletics has drawn huge crowds to the Stade de France for both the evening and traditionally less-popular morning sessions.\n\n\"The great thing about athletics, and it's one of the assets we mustn't ever overlook, is that our fans are not tribal,\" Coe said. \"Every home fan wants their home team to do as well as they possibly can. But it's not a deal-breaker.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Simone Biles falls off balance beam, finishes fifth in finalTeam SportstarBadminton LIVE Score, Paris 2024 Olympics -- August 5 Updates: Lakshya Sen up against Lee Zii Jia in bronze medal match at 6:00 PM; Axelsen vs Viditsarn finalTeam SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Noah Lyles hugely important to athletics, says Coe ReutersParis 2024 Olympics: India through to quarterfinals in women's team table tennisTeam SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Australia swimmers to take long break after \"mentally draining\" Games ReutersREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Coe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Coe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Athletics_Championships_\u2013_Men's_100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/dlc8lp/article68488228.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Paris_Olympics_Day_9_Photo_Gallery_02082.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 3292, "textEnd": 3300}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

World champion Noah Lyles is the Olympic champion in the 100 metres. The 27-year-old from the USA sprinted to gold in Saint-Denis near Paris in front of 70,000 spectators in the final in 9.79 seconds. Lyles is the first 100 metre Olympic champion from the USA since Justin Gatlin won gold 20 years ago in Athens.\n\nSilver went to Jamaican shooting star Kishane Thompson, who clocked 9.79 seconds and only missed out on gold by a thousandth of a second. Bronze went to Fred Kerley from the USA in 9.81 seconds.\n\nHowever, gold medallist sprinter Noah Lyles cannot match Usain Bolt's records.\n\nThe Jamaican made history in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 when he became the first 100-metre sprinter to win the gold medal at the Olympic Games three times in a row. He ran the 100 metres in Rio in 9.81 seconds, a time that Lyles has now beaten in Paris. However, Bolt was significantly faster in Beijing 2008 (9.69 seconds) and London 2012 (9.63 seconds).\n\nIn 1980, Britain's Allan Wells was the last sprinter to win the gold medal by more than 10 seconds.\n\nThe first Olympic 100 metre champion, Tom Burke, took 12 seconds to cover the distance in 1896 - which today would be more than 20 metres behind Bolt at the finish line.\n\nThis development is due to constantly improving equipment, nutrition and training methods.\n\nIn the early days of the 100-metre race, the time was still stopped by hand and the clocks were only accurate to tenths of a second. The first electric timekeeping took place in 1932, but only as an experiment. Officially, the hand-stopped times were used. It was not until 1972 that the electronic, more accurate version of timekeeping was officially introduced - one of the reasons why the times became somewhat slower again. In 1984, Carl Lewis was the first sprinter to stay under 10 seconds, even with electronics. Since then, no 100-metre winner at the Olympics has stayed above this magic mark.\n\nA new face became Olympic champion in the women's event on Saturday evening: Julien Alfred from the small Caribbean state of St Lucia, who only turned professional last year, won gold in 10.72 seconds. She beat the big favourite and world champion Sha'Carri Richardson (USA, 10.87), while her team-mate Melissa Jefferson won bronze (10.92).\n\nFlorence Griffith-Joyner remains the Olympic record holder with 10.54 seconds. No one has yet come close to the then 35-year-old's controversial victory in the 100 metres in 1988.", "source": {"uri": "bernerzeitung.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "Berner Zeitung"}, "authors":

Kishane Thompson (left) assists teammate Oblique Seville of Jamaica moments after the men's 100m finals.\n\nJamaica's eight-year men's 100m major global title drought appeared to have ended under the lights in Paris, France, yesterday. But when the dust settled, by the barest of margins, American Noah Lyles claimed the ultimate prize.\n\nLyles added the Olympic title to the World crown he won last year in Budapest, Hungary, with a personal best effort of 9.79 seconds and a photo-finish time of 9.784. Kishane Thompson, in his first major global final, mined silver while also finishing in 9.79, but with a photo-finish time of 9.789 seconds - .005 behind Lyles. Lyles' teammate, American Fred Kerley, was third in a season's best 9.81 seconds. Jamaica's Oblique Seville, in his third major global final, was eighth in 9.91.\n\nWith Thompson's silver, Jamaica procured its first Olympic medal in the event since Usain Bolt's win in 2016 and its first major global medal for the men's 100m since Bolt's bronze medal in 2017. Although it was not the colour that he would have liked, Thompson was not just appreciative of the medal, but of being able to complete a season in good health.\n\n\"I am super grateful. I came out here injury free. I think that you know my history with injuries. I am a bit disappointed, but I am super grateful and happy at the same time,\" Thompson said.\n\nHe consoled Seville after the race, and Seville hailed his compatriot in his post-race interview with Television Jamaica.\n\nLyles' victory meant that the United States took back the men's 100m Olympic crown it last claimed in 2004.\n\nNatoya Goule-Toppin did not advance to the finals of the women's 800m after finishing sixth in 1:59.14 minutes. Reports emerged that the result is under protest due to an alleged barge [interference], which caused Goule-Toppin to fall behind.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Jamaica suffered another withdrawal as Shericka Jackson did not face the starter of the women's 200m. Jackson's fitness was in question leading up to the Games and she had opted out of the 100m. Lanae Tava Thomas and Niesha Burgher progressed to this afternoon's semi- finals, with second-place finishes in their respective heats.\n\nWorld championships silver medallist Wayne Pinnock and world indoor championship bronze medallist Carey McLeod advanced to the finals of the men's long jump. Pinnock's mark of 7.96 and McLeod's mark of 7.90 were good enough to finish in the top 12 of qualifying. Former world champion Tajay Gayle missed out on the final after his mark of 7.78m was only good enough for 19th place.\n\nReigning Olympic champion Hansle Parchment had to endure a nervous wait but advanced to the semi-finals of the men's 110m hurdles as a non-automatic qualifier after finishing fifth in his heat in 13.43. Orlando Bennett and Commonwealth Games champion Rasheed Broadbell advanced automatically with second-place finishes. Parchment said that while it wasn't the best race, he was committed to improving after getting a race under him.\n\n\"It wasn't the best execution, but I am in the next round, so I have that to look towards now. So I have to put my mind towards that,\" Parchment said\n\nAll three Jamaicans secured passage to the semi-finals of the women's 400m hurdles, registering automatic qualifications. National champion Rushell Clayton won her heat in 54.32, and Shian Salmon finished second in her heat in 53.95. Janieve Russell was third in her heat in 54.67.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Jamaica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television Jamaica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Broadbell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasheed Broadbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Pinnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Pinnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carey_McLeod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carey McLeod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Bennett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Bennett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushell_Clayton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rushell Clayton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajay_Gayle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tajay Gayle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janieve_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janieve Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansle_Parchment", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hansle Parchment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "110 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/media/article_images/2024/08/05/2888676/8096421.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Lyles pipped Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five thousandths of a second, and even last-placed Oblique Seville finished in 9.91 seconds, which would have earned him fourth place in Tokyo.\n\nBEIJING 2008\n\nDespite opening his arms in celebration long before the line, Usain Bolt roared to the title in Beijing's Bird's Nest Stadium in a new world record time of 9.69 seconds. With his win the Jamaican, who celebrated with his now-trademark 'Bolt' celebration, brought a bright new era to a race too often blighted by drug controversies. Richard Thompson of Trinidad was a distant second, and Brian Dix of the US third.\n\nBARCELONA 1992\n\n\"It's Linford Christie!\" roared BBC commentator David Coleman as the Great Britain star surged through in the final stages to become the first British winner of the race since Harold Abrahams in 1924. With the absence of two-time defending champion Carl Lewis who was stricken by a virus at the US Trials, Christie started as one of the favourites, and he won in a time of 9.96 seconds ahead of Namibia's Frankie Fredericks.\n\nSEOUL 1988\n\nBen Johnson blazed over the line in a new world record time of 9. 79 seconds in a race in which, for the first time, four of the eight finalists broke the 10-second barrier. But within three days of his triumph, Johnson tested positive for anabolic steroids and was stripped of his title, with second-placed Carl Lewis promoted to gold. The 1988 has subsequently come to be known as 'The Dirtiest Race in History'.\n\nMUNICH 1936\n\nUnder the eyes of Adolf Hitler, Jesse Owens reigned supreme in Berlin, and his win in the 100 metres, in a time of 10.3 seconds, proved to be his first of four gold medals at the Games. Owens had run 10.2 seconds in his quarter-final but was denied a new world record due to wind assistance.

I came out here and finished injury free. I think you guys know my past issues with injuries, so I am a bit disappointed. But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here,\" said Thompson.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learnt from it,\" he added.\n\nIt was the first time that eight men have finished sub-10 in the same wind legal race and 0.12 is the smallest ever gap between first and eighth in an Olympic or world men's 100m final.\n\nThompson and his compatriot Oblique Seville had already made history, running the fastest ever Olympic 100m semifinal times. Seville made a statement by clocking a PB of 9.81 to win the first semifinal, 0.02 ahead of Lyles. But Thompson responded by running 9.80 to take the third semifinal.\n\nThompson arrived at the men's final as the world leader this season in the event, with his 9.77 time at Jamaican Nationals in late June, but had limited international experience due to a variety of injuries in recent years. He only made his Diamond League debut last July, and has never ran in a world championships.\n\nThe new Olympic silver medallist said he's taking his runner-up performance on the Olympic stage as a learning experience, \"I made it here.

The jumbotron at Stade de France showed both men with a time of 9.79 seconds, while the actual margin between them was almost impossibly slim: Five thousandths of a second.\n\nBrauman, who has coached Lyles for years, watched it all unfold from a spot on the back stretch near the finish line, grappling with the kind of nerves and excitement that only the Olympic final can provide.\n\nAt around the 60-meter mark, he said he felt really good about Lyles' positioning. At 80 meters, he thought \"holy cow, he's right there.\" At 90, he started to worry. It was a much closer race than he thought.\n\n\"I thought he was going to run a (personal best). I have for the past three weeks,\" Brauman said. \"It was just a matter of, was he going to run a big enough PB to win the race? And he did.\"\n\nBrauman said he had to move from his seat to get a better view of the jumbotron. When asked about the time, 9.79, he noted that it was the fastest time to win an Olympic 100-meter final by someone not named Usain Bolt. But he also added that \"I didn't give a (expletive) what the time was, to be totally honest with you.\" Brauman just cared that Lyles crossed the line first.\n\nDitto for the 27-year-old's form at the end, where he might have had a slight lean. (Contrary to preconceived notions, sprinting coaches teach their pupils to run up straight and power through the line, as leaning can cause deceleration.)\n\n\"I haven't seen it on film,\" Brauman said when asked if Lyles broke his form at the finish line. \"If I go back and look at it? Maybe. But I don't really give a (expletive) right this second.\"\n\nBrauman cracked a smile. He's usually pretty reserved but said he went bonkers when he saw that Lyles had become an Olympic champion - a title that eluded him at the 2021 Tokyo Games and has, in part, motivated him in the three years since.\n\nBrauman said this race, like all of Lyles' wins in recent years, isn't about his coaching or the message he offered before the race. But it is special to him. And, at least for now, the meticulous, affable coach with a Southern drawl said the usual analysis of Lyles' technique and form could wait.\n\n\"In races like that, you just got to do what you have to do to get to the line first,\" Brauman said. \"He has a knack for it. And he did a hell of a job today.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.\n\n\u25b6 The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news -- fast.Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbotron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jumbotron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Thompson's medal was the first for a Jamaican man in the sprint events at a major global championship since the legendary Usain Bolt won bronze at the World Championships in 2017.\n\nIt was the third medal won by Jamaica at the Paris Olympics after triple jumper Shanieka Ricketts won silver and shot putter Rajindra Campbell got a bronze on Saturday.\n\nThe 23-year-old Thompson, who is the fastest man in the world this year with his time of 9.77 seconds, was the red-hot favourite to win the gold medal. However, after leading for almost the entire race, the gold medal was snatched away from him by the fast-finishing American and world sprint double champion Noah Lyles, who won the event in a photo-finish with a time of 9.79, in front of a packed house inside Stade de France. The same time was given to Thompson.\n\nLyles' teammate Fred Kerley was third with a season's best of 9.81. Jamaica's other competitor in the final, Oblique Seville, was eighth in 9.91.\n\n\"I am super grateful because I came out here and finished injury-free; I think you guys know my past with injuries,\" said Thompson. \"I am a bit disappointed but I am super grateful and happy at the same time, and I am just going to take it for what it is and just move forward from here,\" he said.\n\nThompson highlighted that he was not pleased with his execution of the race. He noted he had not been patient enough throughout the contest, which led to him losing the gold medal.\n\n\"I wasn't patient enough with my speed and myself to let my speed bring me to the line in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I will learn from it,\" he said. \"I should have been more relaxed and patient with myself.\"\n\nHe said that while he tried his best to win the gold medal for the country, it was just not his day.\n\n\"I am feeling super grateful, and maybe my body language doesn't show it because I am not an expressive guy, but I am glad. I know that Jamaica would have wanted me to get the gold, and everybody loves winners, and I would have loved to win, but big up to the whole field [of] competitors,\" Thompson stated.\n\nNational champion Natoya Goule failed to secure a spot in the final of the women's 800m competition after finishing sixth in 1:59.14.

Wasted, lethargic hours waiting for that one moment, that one thing you've been looking forward to for an age.\n\nOr perhaps there's not enough time.\n\nSuddenly that long-anticipated moment approaches with all the subtlety and hesitancy of a coal train in full flight.\n\nThat is the Olympics.\n\nFour long years (usually) between those moments that everyone remembers.\n\nFour years of waiting.\n\nThat is what Noah Lyles, dramatic champion of the 100m sprint in Paris, was feeling.\n\nHaving missed the event in Tokyo after finishing seventh at the US trials, Lyles was more determined than ever to achieve his goal of adding his name to the list of champions and take the crown as 100/200 sprint king left vacant by Usain Bolt.\n\nAfter all the years of training, all the years of dreaming, before he knew it, he was on the blocks, staring down the purple track, 70,000 pairs of eyes staring intently at him and seven others, everyone holding their breath, silently waiting.\n\nThis is when those seconds begin to stretch again, the gap between being introduced to the crowd and the starter taking control, a time of contemplation in the near-silence.\n\nThen, the robotic-sounding voice tonelessly orders the runners: \"To your marks.\"\n\nMore time. The final seconds will stretch indeterminably as feet are placed on blocks.\n\nThis is where the best runners bend time to their own will, though.\n\nThis is for the final mind games.\n\nFor a race that takes 10 seconds or less to complete, so much is run and done before even stepping onto the track.\n\nThe hype. The posturing. The talk.\n\nIt all has to happen before the race gets underway -- there is simply no time from the moment the gun goes until it's all over.\n\nThat's why the 100m remains the blue ribband event of the Olympics, its winner lauded like no other.\n\nIs it curious that the shortest event on the program carries such immense gravitas?\n\nThe Olympic motto -- Faster. Higher. Stronger -- has it right.\n\nRight at the front. Faster is what people want and, with the 100m, faster is what people get.\n\nIts simplicity is its charm.\n\nRun from this point, to this point: No bends. No obstacles. No complications.\n\nIt's not only in people's dreams that they can sprint. Even a mad dash to the bus stop serves the same purpose as racing down the track -- albeit with slightly less riding on it.\n\nIt will only be a second before the gun, but the pause, heavy with anticipation makes it seem like an age.\n\nThe crowd has been silent now for only a matter of seconds but the air hangs heavy, a pregnant pause weighted like few in world sport -- the great inhale before the roar.\n\nThis is what all the training, all the hours on the track and in the gym, all those frustrating minutes on the treatment table, has been gearing for.\n\nOff goes the gun.\n\nTime, so malleable up until this point, becomes brutally fixed, metronomically determining who will wheel away in the immortal glory that comes with being an Olympic champion.\n\nBut first, the semifinals. There was a bit more time to wait.\n\nIn the first semifinal, Oblique Seville flew out of the blocks, a personal best of 9.81 awaited him.\n\nSeville looked to his right as he closed towards the line, glancing at American favourite Noah Lyles who, slow off the blocks, was finishing quickly on his left to finish in 9.83.\n\nLyles, the personable yet brash 27-year-old hoping to complete the sprint double in Paris, seemed to be a touch surprised as he stared across to his right at the streaking flash of yellow.\n\nThe world champion was yet to cross the line first in a race at this Games.\n\nIn the second semifinal, Akani Simbine and Letsile Tebogo edged out the defending Olympic champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs.\n\nSurprise winner in Tokyo, Italian Jacobs has had a rough three years since that golden night in Japan.\n\nNow, he has a wait to see if he will be one of the two fastest non-automatic qualifiers to progress. It would only be a wait of a handful of minutes to see if he would make the final.\n\nIt would feel like hours. Three years of waiting. Three years of work, condensed into 10 short minutes. All the 29-year-old's hopes resting on the efforts of others.\n\nKishane Thompson up in the next semifinal, the Jamaican flying home in 9.80, ahead of Fred Kerley of America in 9.84.\n\nJacobs could breathe again. His time of 9.92 was enough to qualify, as was American Kenneth Bednarek's 9.93.\n\nTwo Jamaicans. Three Americans. A South African, Botswanan and Italian.\n\nLittle over an hour to wait before a date with destiny.\n\nWhile the crowd experienced the ups and downs of other finals, these sprinters were out back. Recovering.\n\nBut, it was not long before they were back on the track again, time racing as fast as their beating hearts.\n\nTime for the mind games once more.\n\nJacobs and Lyles at polar opposites, the defending champion calm, the upstart making a scene, leaping and jumping and revving up the crowd.\n\nThe referee holds them for an age, allowing the crowd to reach a crescendo and let the tension build even more.\n\nThe shortest race obviously needs the longest build up.\n\nSilence at last. The only sound the buzzing of a helicopter above the Stade de France.\n\nAnother delay.\n\nThen a roar from the bowels of the stadium, 70,000 people screaming for their lives and the life-changing moment they were hoping to see.\n\nThey crossed the finish in a line. \"Photo\" flashed up on the scoreboard. Everyone stared.\n\nThe gap? 0.005 seconds to Thompson and ahead of Kerley in third, just 0.02 behind.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akani_Simbine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akani Simbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d3507bd66ad9e32d10fe17d515ad56d9?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

In the build-up, spectators inside the stadium watched on as dramatic music and a light show echoed around the arena.\n\nBut to the annoyance of many, including those inside the BBC studio, Lyles and his fellow sprinters were forced to wait around three minutes before being positioned on the starting blocks.\n\nColin Jackson, a two-time world champion hurdler who earned a silver medal at the 1988 Olympics, was baffled by the delay.\n\n\"I'm looking down at the track to see if there are any issues, any problems, because we know this race was supposed to start at least three minutes ago,\" he said during the BBC's pre-race coverage.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be anything happening. This is very frustrating for them because this is the biggest race of the year.\"\n\nDenise Lewis, who won gold in the heptathlon at Sydney 2000, added: \"I have to say that it's a little bit unfair to the athletes themselves.\n\n\"You get yourself to that arousal point where you're in the zone, you're absolutely wanting to give everything and then that is just waning slightly, the longer you're left out there.\n\n\"This is the finite margins we're talking about and that for me was just way too long.\"\n\nThe scenes were also criticised by many viewers.\n\nOne fan wrote: \"The lengthy delay before the start of the men's 100m final is unforgivable - the blue riband event, the world's fastest men, nerves already stretched, made to wait and wait for minute after agonising minute.\"\n\nA second said: The wait for this 100m men's final feels like a LIFETIME,\" while a third commented: \"Ok. This is ridiculous how long they are making the runners wait for this 100m final.\"\n\nA fourth wrote: \"Sensational 100m final. A joke of a delay to the showpiece after a great intro. But they all delivered. 9.91 seconds in EIGHTH!!! And 9.79 for BOTH 1st and 2nd... thousandths of a second!! Superb watch.\"\n\nA fifth added: \"That delay before the 100m final was very bad.

Because he's a recognizable face. It's a face that I've now got young people talking about.

But look, what he is recognizing and reflecting on is that he is beginning to transcend his sport, which is really what we want them all to do.\"\n\nCoe meanwhile said Lyles' win by just 0.005sec on Sunday -- the narrowest margin of victory in a 100m final in modern Olympic history -- had demonstrated his greatness.\n\n\"What he has is what all great individuals and great teams in sport have -- when it really matters, they find a way to win, and that's what he did last night,\" Coe said.\n\n\"He was never ahead in that race until the last frame of that photo finish, but he found a way. He didn't look outstanding in the first round, and his semi final was okay, but last night was his kingdom.\"\n\nCoe added that Lyles' enthusiastic embrace of his role as an entertainer was an example to other stars of the sport.\n\n\"I've always said, performance is your passport, but promotion is everything,\" Coe said. \"It's not enough to be just another Olympic champion or another world champion.\n\n\"He wants to fill a stadium and he also wants to fill a press conference.\n\n\"And actually, what he has to say is profoundly important for the sport.

NBC's play-by-play announcer Leigh Diffey called Thompson the winner in the moment during its broadcast.\n\nHowever, a winner was not officially declared as replays and photos were being closely scrutinized. The Jamaican sprinter certainly seemed to think he won, until Lyles came over to tell him that the finish was being reviewed.\n\nThen the photo and slow-motion replay evidence came in and showed that Lyles was indeed the winner. It was close, so very close. Plenty of comparisons were immediately made: By a hair, by a breath, by the blink of the eye. The photo from the Associated Press captures it perfectly.\n\nIn the aftermath, many viewers -- fans and media alike -- criticized NBC for being so quick to call Thompson the winner. Yet the finish was so close and so fast that it's difficult to blame Diffey for calling a result that to the plain eye looked plausibly correct.\n\nAnother issue quickly raised on social media was that the broadcast team went quiet as images of the photo were being reviewed. Did the NBC team suddenly realize it had made a mistake by calling Thompson the winner so swiftly?\n\nYet, what could be said as everyone -- including the race's participants -- were awaiting the official ruling?\n\nSocial media has become the harshest judge of broadcasts and written media.

USA's Noah Lyles emerged victorious in men's 100m final with a photo-finish win over Jamaica. A spectator tried to invade the track wearing a 'Free Palestine' shirt but was stopped before reaching the runners.\n\nThe men's 100m final at the Paris 2024 Olympics was briefly delayed due to a spectator invading the track and causing chaos with security. The 100m final is one of the most highly anticipated events in the Olympics every time the event rolls around. Watching the fastest athletes on the planet competing is quite the thrill ride and after the women's contest took place on Saturday night, it was time for the men to duke it out on Sunday.\n\nFans who tuned in to watch the event had to wait a little longer than they anticipated to watch the event, though, as a spectator from the stands decided to try and invade the track.\n\nRelated Today at the Olympics - Things You May Have Missed from Paris 2024\n\nThe little stories that slipped through the net but make the Olympics so special.\n\n2 An Individual Wearing a Free Palestine Shirt Tried to Invade the Track Olympic officials tackled him before he reached the runners\n\nAs the runners prepared to compete for gold, they had to wait a moment longer than they anticipated as the individual decided to try and approach the track. It's been reported that the spectator was spotted wearing a 'Free Palestine' T-shirt and it seems as though the move was to bring attention to the cause and get as many eyes onto his shirt and the message upon it as possible.\n\nAccording to the Mirror, the invader didn't quite make it to the actual track and the runners before security managed to tackle him to the ground and apprehend him. Speaking after the event, Noah Lyles revealed that he hadn't even noticed someone trying to get onto the running surface.\n\n\"I didn't see anybody try to get on the field. But I won't not going to lie, I was wondering what we were waiting for.\"\n\nThe Men's 100m Final was Incredibly Close It was worth the wait\n\nFans had to wait a little longer than they expected for the 100m men's final to take place, but it was well worth the wait when the contest finally got underway. The race was about as competitive as you could possibly expect at the Olympics. USA star Noah Lyles was one of the favourites heading into the event and he didn't disappoint. The 27-year-old emerged on top, winning the gold medal, but it was far from a straight forward victory.\n\nIt all came down to a photo finish and Lyles managed to beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by 0.005 seconds. To put that into perspective, it takes longer than that to blink. That's about as close as you can get and it shows how fine the margins can be for what is a life-changing result. Lyles finished the race in 9.784 seconds which happens to be his new personal best and now, he has the status and title of being the fastest man on the planet.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/lyles_720.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790103", "eventUri": "eng-9790103", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Lyles needed to produce something special in the biggest race of his career. He tapped into his prime and delivered his personal best performance in front of a jam-packed crowd at the Stade de France.\n\nIn a race that separated the gold and the silver medallists by a matter of milliseconds, Noah emerged victorious and became the fastest man in the men's 100m final. In a race that wrapped up within a blink of an eye, Noah clocked of 9.784s to walk away with the gold. He was just 0.16 seconds of breaking the legendary Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63s.

Noah's compatriot Fred Kerley clinched the bronze medal with his season-best timing of 9.81s.\n\nFollowing his triumph, Noah became the first United States athlete to bag a gold since Justin Gatlin stood at the top of the podium in 2004 in the 100m race. Athletes had to wait for some time for the results as all eight sprinters participating in the event were separated by the tiniest of the margins for the gold medal.\n\nIn the end, it was declared that Noah had 0.005s ahead of Kishane to finish at the top of the podium. Following the announcement, the crowd erupted in a roar and went berserk, applauding the American sprinter for his remarkable triumph. He ripped his name from his shirt and held it high in the air.

But look, what he is recognizing and reflecting on is that he is beginning to transcend his sport, which is really what we want them all to do.\"\n\nCoe meanwhile said Lyles' win by just 0.005sec on Sunday -- the narrowest margin of victory in a 100m final in modern Olympic history -- had demonstrated his greatness.\n\n\"What he has is what all great individuals and great teams in sport have -- when it really matters, they find a way to win, and that's what he did last night,\" Coe said.\n\n\"He was never ahead in that race until the last frame of that photo finish, but he found a way. He didn't look outstanding in the first round, and his semi final was okay, but last night was his kingdom.\"\n\nCoe added that Lyles' enthusiastic embrace of his role as an entertainer was an example to other stars of the sport.\n\n\"I've always said, performance is your passport, but promotion is everything,\" Coe said. \"It's not enough to be just another Olympic champion or another world champion.\n\n\"He wants to fill a stadium and he also wants to fill a press conference.\n\n\"And actually, what he has to say is profoundly important for the sport.

He tapped into his prime and delivered his personal best performance in front of a jam-packed crowd at the Stade de France.\n\nAlso Read | India at Olympics 2024 Schedule Today: Check Full List of Indian Athletes in Action on August 5 in Paris With Time in IST.\n\nIn a race that separated the gold and the silver medallists by a matter of milliseconds, Noah emerged victorious and became the fastest man in the men's 100m final.\n\nIn a race that wrapped up within a blink of an eye, Noah clocked of 9.784s to walk away with the gold. He was just 0.16 seconds of breaking the legendary Usain Bolt's Olympic record of 9.63s.\n\nAlso Read | Mohammed Shami Meets Daughter Aaira in Kolkata, Star Indian Cricketer Gets to Fulfill Rare Opportunity of Father's Role Following Separation With Estranged Wife Hasin Jahan.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson settled for silver after falling short by a fraction of a second in one of the closest 100m races in the history of the Summer Games. Noah's compatriot Fred Kerley clinched the bronze medal with his season-best timing of 9.81s.\n\nFollowing his triumph, Noah became the first United States athlete to bag a gold since Justin Gatlin stood at the top of the podium in 2004 in the 100m race.\n\nAthletes had to wait for some time for the results as all eight sprinters participating in the event were separated by the tiniest of the margins for the gold medal.\n\nIn the end, it was declared that Noah had 0.005s ahead of Kishane to finish at the top of the podium. Following the announcement, the crowd erupted in a roar and went berserk, applauding the American sprinter for his remarkable triumph. He ripped his name from his shirt and held it high in the air.\n\nSouth Africa's Akane Simbine once again missed out on a podium finish by a whisker as he finished fourth. In the Tokyo and Rio Olympics, Simbine was close but fell short of getting his hands on an Olympic medal in the event.\n\nNoah won the 100m and 200m in last year's World Championships. After securing gold in the 100m, he will look to seal his second gold at Paris in the 200m race event.

Hurricane Debby makes landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm. And Noah Lyles is the world's fastest man -- by five-thousandths of a second.\n\nHere's what to know today.\n\nIt will be a critical week for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nShe will visit seven swing states over the course of five days, one of the heaviest weeks of campaign-related travel in the general election.\n\nHarris' team has vetted six possible contenders to be her running mate: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe trip highlights the generational gap between Harris and President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, Democratic allies said. Harris, 59, is a generation younger than Trump, 78, and Biden, 81. In 2020, Biden was the oldest presidential winner in history. If elected, Trump would be the oldest sitting president by the end of his term.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day.

Traveling for campaign events tends to create more opportunities for local media coverage and accelerate fundraising.\n\nHarris is expected to appear alongside her VP pick for the first time tomorrow in Philadelphia, where the pair will kick off the cross-country tour.\n\nLyles earned his first gold medal in 9.79 seconds, which was a personal best. He edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second, with American Fred Kerley behind in 9.81 seconds.\n\nHalfway through the race, Lyles was seventh in an eight-man field, chasing down Thompson, who had the fastest time in the semifinal round from earlier that day. Lyles was still unconvinced he had won the gold medal after finishing and the scoreboard offered no indication of who had won gold, silver or bronze as officials processed a photo finish.\n\n\"I didn't do this against a slow field. I did this against the best of the best, on the biggest stage with the biggest pressure,\" Lyles said. \"And seeing that name, I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, there it is.'\" It was so close that Kerley said \"whoever dipped at the line, they won that race.\"\n\nAccording to Olympic rules and regulations, the first athlete whose torso reaches the closest edge of the finish line is the winner. That means the trunk of the body is what counts, as opposed to the head, limbs or feet. Lyles became the world's fast man -- thanks to the positioning of his body as he crossed the finish line.\n\nWatch the historic photo finish race here.\n\nStream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock.\n\n\ud83e\udd38 Simone Biles will compete in her final two events today.

Most major indices in Europe were most recently between 2% and 3% down, with the Stoxx Europe 600, Europe's benchmark stock index, falling 2.2%.\n\nAll of that follows on from brutal Friday trading, when a much weaker than expected U.S. jobs report made worse a market sell-off that has been underway for some weeks now, although some indexes, such as the Nasdaq, are coming off recent record highs.\n\nIsrael is bracing for a potential multiday attack by Iran and its ally Hezbollah following the assassination of two senior militant leaders last week, an Israeli official told NBC News.

That's what senior business correspondent Christine Romans found when she teamed up with Donovan Lynch, a reporter at NBC's affiliate station in Portland. Without enough affordable housing along the state's picturesque midcoast, some business owners who want to expand their operations are renting out places to their own staffers -- or putting them up for free -- aboard the very boats and in the hotels where they're paid to cook and clean.\n\n-- Rich Bellis, senior business and innovation editor\n\nThe summer heat can leave you feeling sweaty and sticky, but these products could help.

Lyles pipped Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five thousandths of a second, and even last-placed Oblique Seville finished in 9.91 seconds, which would have earned him fourth place in Tokyo.\n\nBEIJING 2008\n\nDespite opening his arms in celebration long before the line, Usain Bolt roared to the title in Beijing's Bird's Nest Stadium in a new world record time of 9.69 seconds. With his win the Jamaican, who celebrated with his now-trademark 'Bolt' celebration, brought a bright new era to a race too often blighted by drug controversies. Richard Thompson of Trinidad was a distant second, and Brian Dix of the US third.\n\nBARCELONA 1992\n\n\"It's Linford Christie!\" roared BBC commentator David Coleman as the Great Britain star surged through in the final stages to become the first British winner of the race since Harold Abrahams in 1924. With the absence of two-time defending champion Carl Lewis who was stricken by a virus at the US Trials, Christie started as one of the favourites, and he won in a time of 9.96 seconds ahead of Namibia's Frankie Fredericks.\n\nSEOUL 1988\n\nBen Johnson blazed over the line in a new world record time of 9. 79 seconds in a race in which, for the first time, four of the eight finalists broke the 10-second barrier. But within three days of his triumph, Johnson tested positive for anabolic steroids and was stripped of his title, with second-placed Carl Lewis promoted to gold. The 1988 has subsequently come to be known as 'The Dirtiest Race in History'.\n\nMUNICH 1936\n\nUnder the eyes of Adolf Hitler, Jesse Owens reigned supreme in Berlin, and his win in the 100 metres, in a time of 10.3 seconds, proved to be his first of four gold medals at the Games. Owens had run 10.2 seconds in his quarter-final but was denied a new world record due to wind assistance. He raced away with the final over Dutchman Tinus Osendarp, for a win that was widely seen to crush Hitler's myth of Aryan supremacy.", "source": {"uri": "kidderminstershuttle.co.uk", "dataType":

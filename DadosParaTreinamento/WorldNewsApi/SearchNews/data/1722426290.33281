{"id": 243327856, "title": "Minimum Wage: Labour Faults Governors Decision To Pay Whatever They Can Afford", "text": "ABUJA \u2013 Following silence from the presidency after Thurs-day\u2019s National Economic Council meeting, chaired by the Vice President, Kashim Shettima, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has blown hot, reacting to the stance of the Ni-gerian Governors Forum over their overbearing influence on the minimum wage negotia-tions. Labour, through its Head, Information and Public Affairs, Benson Upah on Friday, said its incomprehensible that some Nigerian Governors are saying they will pay what they deem fit to Nigerian workers as the min-imum wage. Upah described such utter-ances as not only dictatorial but undermines the very essence as well as the model adopted for cre-ating a national minimum wage in Nigeria. He explained that the concept of a national minimum wage is not arbitrary, stressing that it rep-resents a national wage floor, a baseline below which no worker in the law should be paid. The Labour image maker fur-ther noted that this threshold is a collective agreement that ensures a minimum standard of living for every worker in the law. He said the Governors\u2019 de-mand to unilaterally determine the minimum wage negates this principle and threatens the wel-fare of Nigerian workers and the national economy. Upah said, \u201cIt is important to remind the Governors that the national minimum wage is not synonymous with the individual pay structures of the states which they implement religiously, re-flecting their unique financial capabilities and circumstances. \u201cThis diversity in pay struc-tures underscores the flexibility that already exists within the system, allowing states to reward their workers in alignment with their financial realities. \u201cThe Governors\u2019 argument appears inconsistent when jux-taposed with the remuneration of political office holders. Why is there no hue and cry when po-litical office holders across the nation receive uniform salaries as determined by Revenue Mo-bilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission? This double stan-dard which pits a few privileged against the majority poor is an issue that should be of concern to those who love this country. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by this blatant display of ignorance regarding the global best practic-es for national minimum wage by some of these Governors. It is evident that, despite their fre-quent travels abroad, they have deliberately chosen not to edu-cate themselves on fundamental global issues crucial to successful governance. \u201cThis level of self-imposed ignorance on basic industrial re-lations matters clearly illustrates why our nation is poorly gov-erned, resulting in unacceptable suffering of Nigerians. For this set of governors, we recommend a return to school for proper edu-cation as they constitute a threat to our democracy\u201d. Saturday INDEPENDENT recalls that the President, Bola Ahmed Tinubu had requested for more time to consult other stakeholders before taking a definite stance on the new min-imum wage. But after hours of presiding over the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting on Thurs-day, the presidency failed to give any definite position regarding the new wage benchmark.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"650\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Kashim-Shettima-5.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Kashim-Shettima-5.jpg 650w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Kashim-Shettima-5-300x178.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></div>ABUJA &#8211; Following silence from the presidency after Thurs\u00adday&#8217;s National Economic Council meeting, chaired by the Vice President, Kashim Shettima, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has blown hot, reacting to the stance of the Ni\u00adgerian Governors Forum over their overbearing influence on the minimum wage negotia\u00adtions.

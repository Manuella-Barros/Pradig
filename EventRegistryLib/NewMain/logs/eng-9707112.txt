She defeated 13 competitors from around the world, including 28-year-old rival Mayoi Ebihara of Japan. Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nWith the event's biggest star -- - Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut -- out of the contest this year, Sudo's result set up a possible scenario in which the women's champ out-eats the men's winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.\n\nChestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men's will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.\n\nCompetitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\n\"There's going to be a new champion,\" Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.\n\nLast year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\n\"I'm going to be pushing myself,\" Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMajor League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami.

The 39-year-old Bertoletti defeated 13 competitors from around the world in a test to see who can wolf down the most hot dogs in 10 minutes.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done,\" Bertoletti said.\n\nBertoletti bested his prior record of 55 hot dogs at the event, held every Independence Day on New York's Coney Island.\n\nThe reigning men's champion, Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, didn't attend the competition this year over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, Chestnut will compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. Chestnut won 16 out of 17 previous competitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, defending champion Miki Sudo of Florida won her 10th title in the women's division.\n\nSudo consumed 51 hot dogs in 10 minutes -- and set a new world record for women.\n\n\"I'm just happy to call this mine for another year,\" Sudo said after winning her 10th pink belt.\n\nThe 38-year-old dental hygiene student won last year after forcing down 39 1/2 hot dogs.\n\nSudo also defeated 13 competitors, including 28-year-old rival Mayoi Ebihara of Japan. Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nBertoletti's victory marks the first time the famed mustard belt has gone to someone besides Chestnut since 2015.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture.\n\nCompetitors came from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\nLast year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMajor League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami. The company will also donate to an organization supporting military families based on the number of hot dogs eaten at the event, a spokesperson said.\n\nCedar Attanasio, The Associated Press",

Women's champion sets new record", "body": "Who claimed the coveted Mustard Belt at the 2024 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nThe July 4 event begins with the women's competition at 10:45 a.m. at the corner of Surf and Stillwell in Coney Island, New York. The men chow down at noon.\n\nWhile the tournament is all the same this year, a major player - and an American icon - isn't present.\n\nReigning champion and world record-holder Joey Chestnut won't be participating due to a contractual dispute, leaving him on the sidelines and away from an opportunity at a 17th Mustard Belt. Geoff Esper, the runner-up in 2023, is expected to snag Chestnut's title this year.\n\nHere's who came out victorious in the first Chestnut-less Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.\n\nReigning champion Miki Sudo was victorious yet again, devouring 51 hot dogs and buns in the women's event, which kicked off at 10:45 a.m. Sudo became the first woman to break a 50-dog threshold, eclipsing her personal record of 48 and earning her 10th pink championship belt.\n\nMayoi Ebihara finished second with 37.\n\n\"I mean, I finally did it,\" Sudo told ESPN's Tiffany Greene. \"We finally beat 50. So much of this is thanks to (second-place finisher) Mayoi Ebihara, who was pushing me so much. Obviously I prepared even more because I knew she was going to bring it.\"\n\nThe men's competition airs at noon on ESPN2.\n\nESPN is running re-airs of the men's competition at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. on ESPN. Re-airs will also stream on the ESPN app.\n\nSudo claimed the Mustard Belt in the women's competition last year, earning her ninth title devouring 39\u00bd hot dogs and buns.\n\nChestnut claimed his 16th Mustard Belt after winning last year's men's competition, conquering 62 hot dogs and buns during the 10-minute contest.\n\nIn 2021, Chestnut set the world record for hot dogs and buns eaten with 76. Chestnut set the world record twice in the prior three contests: In 2018, he shattered the world record, devouring 74 hot dogs and buns, and in 2020, he again set the standard, eating 75 hot dogs and buns.\n\nOn the women's side, Sudo is the top dog (eater), setting a record of 48 \u00bd hot dogs and buns in 2020 and topping it this year eating 51 hot dogs and buns.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Chestnut, a 16-time contest winner, recently signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods. Nathan's Famous prohibits eaters from endorsing competitor hot dog brands, which includes the plant-based meat company.\n\n\"We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" Major League Eating, which sanctions the annual contest, said in a statement.\n\nThe organization said it would welcome Chestnut back if he did not represent a rival brand.\n\n\"I was very disappointed to learn from the media today that after nearly 20 years I am banned from the Nathan's 4th of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" Chestnut said on Instagram. \"I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (condiment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Famous", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Famous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Championship_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Championship belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6ZrV7U63Z6yBAU.gbO0GiQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cincinnati-com-the-enquirer/9fddaca29adb94607f76afbf8ca38fe1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 100, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

She defeated 13 competitors worldwide, including 28-year-old rival Mayoi Ebihara of Japan. Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nWith the event's biggest star -- - Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut -- out of the contest this year, Sudo's result set up a possible scenario in which the women's champ out-eats the men's winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51 but only ate 49 last year.\n\nChestnut, who won 16 of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside Nathan's original location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men's will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.\n\nCompetitors come from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\n\"There's going to be a new champion,\" Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.\n\nLast year, Chestnut chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes.

Chestnut will attempt to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products in the competition, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's live YouTube stream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami. A spokesperson said the company will also donate to an organization supporting military families based on the number of hot dogs eaten at the event.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType":

Competitive eaters gather to devour as many hot dogs as they can. However, this year, the event's main attraction will be elsewhere, 1,900 miles away.\n\nJoey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, the dominant winner of 16 out of 17 past competitions, will not be present due to a sponsorship disagreement. Instead, he will be facing off against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso on the same day.\n\nWith Chestnut absent, the stage is set for a new champion at the traditional Brooklyn event. Eaters from various parts of the world will participate on the Fourth of July to demonstrate their capacity for consuming hot dogs within a 10-minute timeframe.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN will broadcast the contest live, kicking off with the women's division at 11 a.m. ET, while the men's will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.\n\nCompetitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\n\"There's going to be a new champion,\" Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.\n\nLast year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\nAhead of the event, ESPN said it would focus on two Americans with dedicated camera shots: Massachusetts high school teacher Geoffrey Esper, in the men's division, and Florida dental hygiene student Miki Sudo, in the women's.\n\nEsper came second last year with 49 dogs and buns, though his personal best is 51. Sudo won her ninth title in 2023 with 39 1/2, but her best is 48 1/2, the women's world record.\n\n\"I'm going to be pushing myself,\" Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMajor League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami. The company will also donate to an organization supporting military families based on the number of hot dogs eaten at the event, a spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com",

Patrick Bertoletti took the top prize in the men's contest, while defending champion Miki Sudo reigned supreme -- and made history -- in the women's battle.\n\nSudo broke the previous record in the women's contest, consuming 51 hot dogs in the allotted time period. This was her 10th time winning the coveted pink belt. The Florida native beat out 13 other competitors from around the world, including the runner-up from last year, Mayoi Ebihara, who came in second, consuming only 37 hot dogs. The third place contestant, Michelle Lesco, ate 23.5 hot dogs.\n\n\"Breaking 50 is a milestone for all women and I'm really excited to be a part of it,\" Sudo told theNew York Post after her win.\n\nAs for the men, many were expecting the runner-up from last year's contest, Geoffrey Esper, to win, but he was ultimately beaten by Bertoletti, who gobbled down a whopping 58 hot dogs. Esper ate 53, and the third place contestant, James Webb, consumed 32.\n\nThis was the first time in 16 years that someone other than Joey Chestnut has won the contest. The hot dog eating champ did not even appear at the boardwalk this year after announcing that he would be competing in a different hot dog competition in Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\nOn June 11, it was first announced that Chestnut, who has won the eating competition a total of 16 times, was not allowed to compete because of a deal he has with a Nathan's competitor, Impossible Foods, which recently released a plant-based hot dog.\n\n\"We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" a statement from MLE said at the time, adding that they made accommodations for Chestnut to compete in a Labor Day hot dog eating contest that would not feature any specific brands.\n\nThe statement ended: \"For nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions. However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different brand over our long-time relationship. Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest. We hope he returns when he is not representing a rival brand.\"\n\nChestnut went on to respond to the statement in an Instagram post, claiming that the rules were changed this year.\n\n\"They are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with,\" Chestnut claimed. \"This is apparently the basis on which I'm being banned, and it doesn't impact the July 4th contest.\"\n\nMLE told The Independent that Chestnut has never been allowed to endorse another hot dog brand. \"In return for his fees to appear and compete, Joey agreed every single year to a very simple exclusivity provision -- that he would not endorse or sponsor another hot dog brand,\" a representative for the organization said.\n\n\"The idea that Nathan's or MLE changed the rules this year is as ridiculous as it is silly. What company would pay someone an appearance fee of several hundred thousand dollars and knowingly let them endorse a direct competitor immediately afterwards?\"\n\n\"Joey was not banned,\" the statement continued. \"Joey chose not to compete in the contest the moment he chose to make an endorsement deal with one of Nathan's competitors.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Famous", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Famous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Lesco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Lesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bertoletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Bertoletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bliss", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Bliss"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Bliss"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/42cfee3025f6b1417fd0cb3a8e406bd9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 213, "textEnd": 219, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 1502, "textEnd": 1509}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

While the tournament is all the same, a major player - and an American icon - won't be present.\n\nThis year, Joey Chestnut wasn't be part of the contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating, leaving him on the sidelines and away from an opportunity at a 17th Mustard Belt. That opens the door (and the esophagus) for Geoff Esper, who was the runner-up in 2023.\n\nOn the women's side, it was Miki Sudo and the field: Sudo is now a 10-time winner of the Ketchup Belt and has finished at the top of the heap in every contest she's performed in.\n\nSun's out, buns out: Here's how to kick off your Fourth of July festivities with a bang with the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.\n\nPatrick Bertoletti reacts after victory\n\n\"I just can't believe it,\" he said on ESPN's telecast, noting he always finishes second or third when he competes at Nathan's. \"I lost some weight. Just lots of work. There's an urgency.\n\n\"With Joey not here, I knew I had a shot. I was able to unlock something that I don't know where it came from.\"\n\nBertoletti prevails with 58 dogs!\n\nPatrick Bertoletti, 39, of Illinois won the Mustard Belt by eating 58 hot dogs and buns in a back-and-forth 10-minute battle among a handful of eaters. It was the first time someone other than Joey Chestnut has won the contest since 2015, when Chestnut lost to Matt Stonie.\n\nBertoletti rallied from an early deficit and broke his personal record of 55 hot dogs.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done,\" he said moments after the competition.\n\nGeoffrey Esper of Massachusetts finished second with 53 hot dogs.\n\nDown to the wire\n\nWith three minutes to go, Bertoletti, Webb and Esper neck and neck. Photo finish to come?\n\nHalfway home\n\nAt the five-minute mark, Patrick Bertoletti and James have eclipsed the 30 hot dog threshold.\n\nJames Webb devouring three dogs at a time.\n\nTight battle\n\nPatrick Bertoletti, James Webb, Nick Wehry and Geoffrey Esper in a tight battle three minutes in.\n\nRoyal couple of hot-dog eating\n\nNick Wehry, fianc\u00e9 of Miki Sudo, is out to the early lead.\n\n10, 9, 8, 7, 6 ...\n\nThey're off and eating.\n\nReady, set ...\n\nHot dogs are cooked and plated. Competitors are situated and ready. The perfect time for a commercial break, right? Right.\n\nTake the stage, eaters\n\nIntros for the men's competition are underway as only George Shea, the inimitable emcee can handle them. Ricardo Corbucci of Brazil takes the stage wrapped with a half-American, half-Brazilian flag. He'll be making his Nathan's debut as, according to Shea, the No. 1 competitive eater in Brazil. (Haven't had a chance to double-check those rankings.) Several international competitors on hand. Representing Japan, the Czech Republic, England and Australia.\n\n#FreeJoey, #LetJoeyEat\n\nThe X account for Major League Eating (MLE), which essentially banned Chestnut from competing at Nathan's this year, has become a gathering place for Chestnut (mostly) supporters. Popular hashtags: #FreeJoey and #LetJoeyEat.\n\nMLE's official announcement about Chestnut's status June 11 triggered 296 comments, including:\n\n\"The 30 for 30 about the downfall of the Nathan's hot dog eating contest is gonna be lit.\"\n\n\"This is like Caitlin left off the USA team. I mean who is in charge over there. Watch the viewer drop 50%.\"\n\n\"Strip his old victories and records away from him, too.\"\n\n'The Babe Ruth of Beef'\n\nSo said ESPN's Jeremy Schaap in narrating a tribute to Chestnut with footage of his triumphs and rare setbacks (the loss to Matt Stonie in 2015).\n\n\"This year the greatest eater of our time has put down the dogs and buns,\" Schaap said. \"At least the Nathan's dogs and buns.\"\n\nMiki Sudo not done eating\n\nWhat, you thought she'd stop after consuming 51 hot dogs and buns?\n\n\"I'll probably look for something cold and refreshing,\" she told ESPN's Tiffany Greene about an hour after her triumphant victory. \"Maybe some fruit or soft serve.\"\n\nMiki Sudo does it again (on replay)\n\nESPN is kicking off its next segment of the Nathan's contest with a replay of Sudo's record-breaking performance of 51 hot dogs and puns. Almost as impressive on replay as live.\n\nAnother new world record ... for what?!\n\nEric \"Badlands\" Booker etched his name in competitive eating (and drinking) history when he chugged a gallon of Nathan's Famous lemonade in 21 seconds. Yeah, the Lemonade Chugging Contest is a thing.\n\nBack in action\n\nThe broadcast is live as the men's competition approaches with just a slight change in regular programming. No Joey Chestnut.\n\nBanned after signing an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, Chestnut will be eating later today at the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas.\n\nJoey Chestnut on their minds\n\nMiki Sudo exults after record-breaking performance\n\nRelish the break\n\nGrab yourself a hot dog - beef or plant-based - and hang on during the intermission. The men's competition will start at noon ET.\n\nMiki Sudo: 'I finally did it'\n\nSudo had another pink championship slung across her shoulder after shattering the women's contest record with 51 hot dogs and gun - more than any other competitor but Joey Chestnut ate last year.\n\n\"I mean, I finally did it,\" Sudo told ESPN's Tiffany Greene. \"We finally beat 50. So much of this is thanks to (second-place finisher) Mayoi Ebihara, who was pushing me so much. Obviously I prepared even more because I knew she was going to bring it.\"\n\nMiki Sudo shatters record!\n\nSudo ate 51 hot dogs and buns, becoming the first woman to break 50-dog threshold and eclipsing her personal record of 48. She crushed her competitors and won her 10th pink championship belt.\n\nEbihara finished second with 37.\n\nEmcee George Shea raising the possibility of Sudo outeating the men in the 10-minute competition.\n\nMiki Sudo cruising\n\nShe has a 12-dog lead with just over two minutes to eat. She's closing in on her personal record.\n\nMiki Sudo's technique\n\nSudo once experimented with Joey Chestnut-style: two dogs at a time. Not today. She's putting them down one at a time and has a four-dog league at the six-minute mark. ... Well, check that. On the fly, Sudo starts shoving the hot dogs down her gullet two at a time.\n\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\n\nThe countdown is complete and the devouring has begun. Sudo takes an early lead, devouring 10 hot dogs for a two-dog margin over the field.\n\nHere comes the defending champ, Miki Sudo\n\nClutching a pink championship belt, Sudo takes the stage. So has her most serious challenger, Mayoi Ebihara, a 5-foot-1 eater from Japan. Last year Ebinara wolfed down 33.5 hot dogs and buns during her contest debut at Nathan's.\n\nWho are these women competing in the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nIntros underway. Miki Sudo, and the 13 competitors she's about to beat for her 10th title in 11 years. Jocelyn Young? Thanks for coming. Tandra Childress? Good to have you here. Katie Prettyman, take your place on the platform. But, let's face it, Sudo is the big favorite.\n\nMassive crowd swells for Hot Dog Eating Contest\n\nWell, no massive boycott in Coney Island for the ban of Joey Chestnut. Massive crowd gathered for the contest, which begins with the women's competition at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nWhat time is the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nWomen's competition start time: 10:45 a.m. ET\n\nMen's competition start time: Noon ET\n\nMiki Sudo and the women get the Nathan's Famous festivities underway at 10:45 a.m. ET. Geoff Esper and the men take the stage around noon.\n\nSTREAM: Watch the 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest channel\n\nWomen's competition: ESPN3\n\nMen's competition: ESPN2\n\nThe women's side of the competition will air on ESPN3, the digital network. ESPN2 will carry the men's competition.\n\nWhy isn't Joey Chestnut competing in the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nChestnut will not be competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating, the organization that sanctions the event.\n\nIn June, Chestnut signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods to sponsor a new, meatless hot dog. Representing a rival brand is something that gave MLE and Nathan's Famous more than a bit of indigestion, leading to him not being at the event this year.\n\nThe ban, though, isn't permanent, according to MLE, which wants Chestnut to compete at future events.\n\n\"Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\" MLE said in a statement.\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest field 2024\n\nThough Joey Chestnut isn't competing, there are still plenty of glizzy gobblers on the men's and women's side, including chew-perstar eater Miki Sudo.\n\nHere's the field:\n\nMen's\n\nGeoffrey Esper\n\nJames Webb\n\nPatrick Bertoletti\n\nNicholas Wehry\n\nGideon Oji\n\nSean Yeager\n\nGeorge Chiger\n\nMax Stanford\n\nRicardo Corbucci\n\nDerek Hendrickson\n\nKing Yamamoto\n\nWilliam Claude Lyon IV\n\nDarrien Thomas\n\nRadim Dvoracek\n\nWomen's\n\nMiki Sudo\n\nMayoi Ebihara\n\nMichelle Lesco\n\nLarell Marie Mele\n\nKatie Prettyman\n\nTandra Childress\n\nJocelyn Young\n\nMary Bowers\n\nCherish Brown\n\nJulie Goldberg\n\nEllen Straub\n\nCrystal Ocampo\n\nRubianne Garcia\n\nElizabeth Salgado\n\nJoey Chestnut a fan of Geoff Esper\n\nJoey Chestnut is out of the competition, but not out of the loop. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, he offered thoughts on who might win the men's contest this year.\n\n\"There's Geoff Esper,\" Chestnut said. \"He's an amazing eater and he just hasn't been able to have a good contest on the Fourth of July. But he's capable of 57. James Webb, he's new and he's getting better. So I can see his technique and eventually I think he'll be in the 60s. He's just getting started. Pat Bertoletti, I think he did 55 years ago (actually 49) and he started training a lot harder once he realize there was a chance (Chestnut would not complete).\n\n\"They're awesome dudes.\"\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest records\n\nIn 2021, Joey Chestnut set the world record for hot dogs and buns eaten with 76. Chestnut set the world record twice in the prior three contests: In 2018, he shattered the world record, devouring 74 hot dogs and buns, and in 2020, he again set the standard, eating 75 hot dogs and buns.\n\nOn the women's side, Miki Sudo is the top dog (eater), munching 48 \u00bd hot dogs and buns in 2020.\n\nHow many times has Joey Chestnut won the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nChestnut holds the record for most Mustard Belts, winning the contest 16 times. On the women's side, Miki Sudo has been an unstoppable eating force, winning nine of the last 10 Ketchup Belts.\n\nJoey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi\n\nThough he's not eating hot dogs on the Fourth of July, Chestnut will return to the competitive eating spotlight in a big, big way in 2024, by facing an old rival.\n\nChestnut will take on nemesis Takeru Kobayashi on Sept. 2 in a live Netflix special titled \"Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef.\"\n\n\"Through all of my years in competitive eating, Kobayashi stands out as my fiercest rival,\" Chestnut said in a statement. \"Competing against him pushed me to be so much better. I know that fans have waited a long time for another chapter of our rivalry and I can't wait for our massive showdown live on Netflix!\"\n\nKobayashi and Chestnut last jawed off in 2009, with Chestnut chewing out the six-time Mustard Belt winner.\n\nWho won the Hot Dog Eating Contest last year?\n\nNo surprises here: Joey Chestnut won a rain-soaked event that was threatened to be canned by Mother Nature. But the show went on, and so did Chestnut: He won the event by downing 62 dogs and buns, with Geoff Esper coming in second with 49 dogs and buns.\n\nList of past Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest winners\n\n\uf0b7 2023: Joey Chestnut, 62 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 39 1/2 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2022: Joey Chestnut, 63 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 40 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2021: Joey Chestnut, 73 (men's) | Michelle Lesco, 30 3/4 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2020: Joey Chestnut, 75 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 48 1/2 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2019: Joey Chestnut, 71 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 31 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2018: Joey Chestnut, 74 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 37 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2017: Joey Chestnut, 72 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 41 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2016: Joey Chestnut, 70 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 38 1/2 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2015: Matt Stonie, 62 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 38 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2014: Joey Chestnut, 61 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 34 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2013: Joey Chestnut, 69 (men's) | Sonya Thomas, 36 3/4 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2012: Joey Chestnut, 68 (men's) | Sonya Thomas, 45 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 *2011: Joey Chestnut, 62 (men's) | Sonya Thomas, 40 (women's)\n\n\uf0b7 2010: Joey Chestnut, 54\n\n\uf0b7 2009: Joey Chestnut, 68\n\n\uf0b7 2008: Joey Chestnut, 59 (defeated Takeru Kobayashi in an untimed eat-off, eating five hot dogs in 50 seconds)\n\n\uf0b7 2007: Joey Chestnut, 66\n\n\uf0b7 2006: Takeru Kobayashi, 53 3/4\n\n\uf0b7 2005: Takeru Kobayashi, 49\n\n\uf0b7 2004: Takeru Kobayashi, 53 1/2\n\n\uf0b7 2003: Takeru Kobayashi, 44 1/2\n\n\uf0b7 2002: Takeru Kobayashi, 50 1/2\n\n\uf0b7 2001: Takeru Kobayashi, 50\n\n\uf0b7 2000: Kazutoyo Arai, 25 1/8\n\n\uf0b7 1999: Steve Keiner, 21 1/2\n\n\uf0b7 1998: Hirofumi Nakajima, 19\n\n\uf0b7 1997: Hirofumi Nakajima, 24 1/2\n\n\uf0b7 1996: Ed Krachie, 22\n\n\uf0b7 1995: Ed Krachie, 19 1/2\n\n\uf0b7 1994: Mike DeVito, 20\n\nWhat is a 'glizzy?'\n\nA \"glizzy\" is a slang term for a hot dog.

Instead, Chestnut will compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. Chestnut won 16 out of 17 previous competitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, defending champion Miki Sudo of Florida won her 10th title in the women's division.\n\nSudo consumed 51 hot dogs in 10 minutes -- and set a new world record for women.\n\n\"I'm just happy to call this mine for another year,\" Sudo said after winning her 10th pink belt.\n\nThe 38-year-old dental hygiene student won last year after forcing down 39 1/2 hot dogs.\n\nSudo also defeated 13 competitors, including 28-year-old rival Mayoi Ebihara of Japan.

The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMajor League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut

While the tournament is all the same, a major player - and an American icon - won't be present.\n\nThis year, Joey Chestnut wasn't be part of the contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating, leaving him on the sidelines and away from an opportunity at a 17th Mustard Belt. That opens the door (and the esophagus) for Geoff Esper, who was the runner-up in 2023.\n\nOn the women's side, it was Miki Sudo and the field: Sudo is now a 10-time winner of the Ketchup Belt and has finished at the top of the heap in every contest she's performed in.\n\nSun's out, buns out: Here's how to kick off your Fourth of July festivities with a bang with the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.\n\nBertoletti prevails with 58 dogs!\n\nPatrick Bertoletti of Illinois won the Mustard Belt by eating 58 hot dogs and buns in a back-and-forth battle among a handful of eaters. It was the first time someone other than Joey Chestnut has won the contest since 2015, when Chestnut lost to Matt Stonie.\n\nBertoletti rallied from an early deficit and broke his personal record of 55 hot dogs.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done,\" he said moments after the competition.\n\nGeoffrey Esper of Massachusetts finished second with 53 hot dogs.\n\nDown to the wire\n\nWith three minutes to go, Bertoletti, Webb and Esper neck and neck. Photo finish to come?\n\nHalfway home\n\nAt the five-minute mark, Patrick Bertoletti and James have eclipsed the 30 hot dog threshold.\n\nPatrick Bertoletti, James Webb, Nick Wehry and Geoffrey Esper in a tight battle three minutes in.\n\nRoyal couple of hot-dog eating\n\nNick Wehry, fianc\u00e9 of Miki Sudo, is out to the early lead.\n\nHot dogs are cooked and plated. Competitors are situated and ready. The perfect time for a commercial break, right? Right.\n\nTake the stage, eaters\n\nIntros for the men's competition are underway as only George Shea, the inimitable emcee can handle them. Ricardo Corbucci of Brazil takes the stage wrapped with a half-American, half-Brazilian flag. He'll be making his Nathan's debut as, according to Shea, the No. 1 competitive eater in Brazil. (Haven't had a chance to double-check those rankings.) Several international competitors on hand. Representing Japan, the Czech Republic, England and Australia.\n\n#FreeJoey, #LetJoeyEat\n\nThe X account for Major League Eating (MLE), which essentially banned Chestnut from competing at Nathan's this year, has become a gathering place for Chestnut (mostly) supporters. Popular hashtags: #FreeJoey and #LetJoeyEat.\n\nMLE's official announcement about Chestnut's status June 11 triggered 296 comments, including:\n\n\"The 30 for 30 about the downfall of the Nathan's hot dog eating contest is gonna be lit.\"\n\n\"This is like Caitlin left off the USA team. I mean who is in charge over there. Watch the viewer drop 50%.\"\n\n\"Strip his old victories and records away from him, too.\"\n\n'The Babe Ruth of Beef'\n\nSo said ESPN's Jeremy Schaap in narrating a tribute to Chestnut with footage of his triumphs and rare setbacks (the loss to Matt Stonie in 2015).\n\n\"This year the greatest eater of our time has put down the dogs and buns,\" Schaap said. \"At least the Nathan's dogs and buns.\"\n\nMiki Sudo not done eating\n\nWhat, you thought she'd stop after consuming 51 hot dogs and buns?\n\n\"I'll probably look for something cold and refreshing,\" she told ESPN's Tiffany Greene about an hour after her triumphant victory. \"Maybe some fruit or soft serve.\"\n\nMiki Sudo does it again (on replay)\n\nESPN is kicking off its next segment of the Nathan's contest with a replay of Sudo's record-breaking performance of 51 hot dogs and puns. Almost as impressive on replay as live.\n\nAnother new world record ... for what?!\n\nEric \"Badlands\" Booker etched his name in competitive eating (and drinking) history when he chugged a gallon of Nathan's Famous lemonade in 21 seconds. Yeah, the Lemonade Chugging Contest is a thing.\n\nBack in action\n\nThe broadcast is live as the men's competition approaches with just a slight change in regular programming. No Joey Chestnut.\n\nBanned after signing an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, Chestnut will be eating later today at the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas.\n\nJoey Chestnut on their minds\n\nMiki Sudo exults after record-breaking performance\n\nRelish the break\n\nGrab yourself a hot dog - beef or plant-based - and hang on during the intermission. The men's competition will start at noon ET.\n\nMiki Sudo: 'I finally did it'\n\nSudo had another pink championship slung across her shoulder after shattering the women's contest record with 51 hot dogs and gun - more than any other competitor but Joey Chestnut ate last year.\n\n\"I mean, I finally did it,\" Sudo told ESPN's Tiffany Greene. \"We finally beat 50. So much of this is thanks to (second-place finisher) Mayoi Ebihara, who was pushing me so much. Obviously I prepared even more because I knew she was going to bring it.\"\n\nMiki Sudo shatters record!\n\nSudo ate 51 hot dogs and buns, becoming the first woman to break 50-dog threshold and eclipsing her personal record of 48. She crushed her competitors and won her 10th pink championship belt.\n\nEbihara finished second with 37.\n\nEmcee George Shea raising the possibility of Sudo outeating the men in the 10-minute competition.\n\nMiki Sudo cruising\n\nShe has a 12-dog lead with just over two minutes to eat. She's closing in on her personal record.\n\nMiki Sudo's technique\n\nSudo once experimented with Joey Chestnut-style: two dogs at a time. Not today. She's putting them down one at a time and has a four-dog league at the six-minute mark. ... Well, check that. On the fly, Sudo starts shoving the hot dogs down her gullet two at a time.\n\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\n\nThe countdown is complete and the devouring has begun. Sudo takes an early lead, devouring 10 hot dogs for a two-dog margin over the field.\n\nHere comes the defending champ, Miki Sudo\n\nClutching a pink championship belt, Sudo takes the stage. So has her most serious challenger, Mayoi Ebihara, a 5-foot-1 eater from Japan. Last year Ebinara wolfed down 33.5 hot dogs and buns during her contest debut at Nathan's.\n\nWho are these women competing in the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nIntros underway. Miki Sudo, and the 13 competitors she's about to beat for her 10th title in 11 years. Jocelyn Young? Thanks for coming. Tandra Childress? Good to have you here. Katie Prettyman, take your place on the platform. But, let's face it, Sudo is the big favorite.\n\nMassive crowd swells for Hot Dog Eating Contest\n\nWell, no massive boycott in Coney Island for the ban of Joey Chestnut. Massive crowd gathered for the contest, which begins with the women's competition at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nMiki Sudo and the women get the Nathan's Famous festivities underway at 10:45 a.m. ET. Geoff Esper and the men take the stage around noon.\n\nThe women's side of the competition will air on ESPN3, the digital network. ESPN2 will carry the men's competition.\n\nWhy isn't Joey Chestnut competing in the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nChestnut will not be competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating, the organization that sanctions the event.\n\nIn June, Chestnut signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods to sponsor a new, meatless hot dog. Representing a rival brand is something that gave MLE and Nathan's Famous more than a bit of indigestion, leading to him not being at the event this year.\n\nThe ban, though, isn't permanent, according to MLE, which wants Chestnut to compete at future events.\n\n\"Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\" MLE said in a statement.\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest field 2024\n\nThough Joey Chestnut isn't competing, there are still plenty of glizzy gobblers on the men's and women's side, including chew-perstar eater Miki Sudo.\n\nJoey Chestnut is out of the competition, but not out of the loop. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, he offered thoughts on who might win the men's contest this year.\n\n\"There's Geoff Esper,\" Chestnut said. \"He's an amazing eater and he just hasn't been able to have a good contest on the Fourth of July. But he's capable of 57. James Webb, he's new and he's getting better. So I can see his technique and eventually I think he'll be in the 60s. He's just getting started. Pat Bertoletti, I think he did 55 years ago (actually 49) and he started training a lot harder once he realize there was a chance (Chestnut would not complete).\n\nIn 2021, Joey Chestnut set the world record for hot dogs and buns eaten with 76. Chestnut set the world record twice in the prior three contests: In 2018, he shattered the world record, devouring 74 hot dogs and buns, and in 2020, he again set the standard, eating 75 hot dogs and buns.\n\nOn the women's side, Miki Sudo is the top dog (eater), munching 48 \u00bd hot dogs and buns in 2020.\n\nHow many times has Joey Chestnut won the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nChestnut holds the record for most Mustard Belts, winning the contest 16 times. On the women's side, Miki Sudo has been an unstoppable eating force, winning nine of the last 10 Ketchup Belts.\n\nJoey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi\n\nThough he's not eating hot dogs on the Fourth of July, Chestnut will return to the competitive eating spotlight in a big, big way in 2024, by facing an old rival.\n\nChestnut will take on nemesis Takeru Kobayashi on Sept. 2 in a live Netflix special titled \"Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef.\"\n\n\"Through all of my years in competitive eating, Kobayashi stands out as my fiercest rival,\" Chestnut said in a statement. \"Competing against him pushed me to be so much better.\u202fI know that fans have waited a long time for another chapter of our rivalry and I can't wait for our massive showdown live on Netflix!\"\n\nKobayashi and Chestnut last jawed off in 2009, with Chestnut chewing out the six-time Mustard Belt winner.\n\nWho won the Hot Dog Eating Contest last year?\n\nNo surprises here: Joey Chestnut won a rain-soaked event that was threatened to be canned by Mother Nature. But the show went on, and so did Chestnut: He won the event by downing 62 dogs and buns, with Geoff Esper coming in second with 49 dogs and buns.\n\nList of past Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest winners\n\n\uf0b7 2008: Joey Chestnut, 59 (defeated Takeru Kobayashi in an untimed eat-off, eating five hot dogs in 50 seconds)\n\nA \"glizzy\" is a slang term for a hot dog. The word has unknown origins, but some trace it back to handguns: A \"Glizzy\" is a slang term for a Glock handgun.

She defeated 13 competitors from around the world, including 28-year-old rival Mayoi Ebihara of Japan. Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nWith the event's biggest star -- Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut - out of the contest this year, Sudo's result set up a possible scenario in which the women's champ out-eats the men's winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.\n\nChestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day.\n\nThat leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men's will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.\n\nCompetitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\n\"There's going to be a new champion,\" Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.\n\nLast year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes.

The 26-year-old, who hails from Chicago, last participated in the annual event in 2022, chowing down on less than 35 hot dogs at the time.\n\nThursday's victory saw Bertoletti breaking his personal record of 55 hot dogs and buns.\n\nThis year, the competition was without competitive eating's biggest star, Joey Chestnut.\n\nChestnut, 40, was barred from competing after signing an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, the plant-based meat company.\n\nLast year, Chestnut -- a 16-time Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest champion -- won the contest by eating 62 hot dogs and buns. He set the world record in the event in 2021 when he guzzled 76 dogs and buns.\n\n\"We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" Major League Eating (MLE) announced in a June 11 statement.\n\nMLE said they went to \"great lengths\" to make something work, but ultimately admitted \"it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our long-time relationship.\"\n\nChestnut responded on social media, saying MLE was looking to \"change the rules\" about being affiliated with other food brands.\n\n\"This is apparently the basis on which I'm being banned,\" he wrote via Instagram June 11, \"and it doesn't impact the July 4th contest.\"\n\nChestnut called the decision to bar him from the contest \"very disappointing\" and that the ruling \"will deprive the great fans of the holiday's usual joy and entertainment.\"\n\n\"I love competing in that event,\" Chestnut continued. \"I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title.\"\n\nInstead, Chestnut is taking his talents to Texas' Fort Bliss on the 4th of July, where he is competing in a 5-minute eating contest against four soldiers.

Clary/AFP / Getty Images\n\nThere is a new Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest winner in town!\n\nOn July 4, dark horse Patrick Bertoletti officially took over the title from reigning champ Joey Chestnut, who was previously crowned the winner of the annual competition 16 times. Chestnut noted on social media in June that he would not be in participating in this year's event.\n\n\"It's go time! Are you with me Brooklyn?\" announcer George Shea asked the crowd at Coney Island during his signature grand introduction.\n\nTen minutes after Shea welcomed each contestant to the stage by sharing some dramatic and funny background information, the Mustard Belt was placed around a new winner in the men's division for the first time in eight years.\n\nShea raised Bertoletti's arm in victory and he held the shiny belt over his head. His performance marked his first career title.\n\nThe ESPN announcers deemed it the closest competition since 2015.\n\nBertoletti came into the event ranked No. 9 in the world. \"It was all focus today,\" he told Shea. \"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done.\"\n\nHe later said it felt like he was a bridesmaid who finally became a bride. The competitive eater said it took him three months of practice and he was in disbelief that he pulled it off.\n\n\"There was an urgency. With Joey not here, I knew I had a shot,\" he shared. \"I was able to unlock something. I don't know where it came from, but I'm not complaining.\"\n\nBertoletti called it a life-changing moment.\n\nIn the women's division, Sudo held onto her crown, bringing her total number of wins to 10 titles. Sudo is currently ranked the No. 1 competitive female eater.\n\nFans at Coney Island gawked as Bertoletti and Sudo scarfed down an impressive number of hot dogs in just 10 minutes.\n\nBertoletti managed to eat 58, his personal best, while Sudo was not too far behind with a record-breaking 51 hot dugs and buns. According to ESPN, she is now the only women to eat more than 50 franks. She also passed her personal (and world) record of 48.5 hot dogs, which she set in 2020.\n\n\"The 50 hot dog threshold has been broken,\" an ESPN announcer said in a clip uploaded to X as the clock wound down. Another announcer wondered if Sudo could potentially compete in the men's division in the future.\n\nAn hour after her victory, Sudo spoke about her historic performance.\n\n\"Even 10 years into this, I still have even more to show,\" she said. \"The women's record is just going to improve from here on out and there's a lot of exciting things to come.\"\n\nWhen asked what she wanted to eat now, she replied, \"Probably I'll look for something cold and refreshing. Maybe a piece of fruit (or) soft serve.\"\n\nSudo dominated the competition to secure the Ketchup Belt again -- followed by second place finisher Mayoi Ebihara, who ate 37 hot dogs. Ebihara was also the runner-up last year when she made her debut at the contest.\n\nLast year, 35,000 spectators, according to the American hot dog company, flocked to Coney Island to watch Sudo and Chestnut reclaim their titles. Sudo ate 39.5 hot dogs at the time and Chestnut, the current No. 1 competitive eater, managed to down a whopping 62 hot dogs in just 10 minutes.\n\nWhile fans were excited to see this year's winners, Chestnut's absence from the annual event was notable. The former title holder, who set the all-time record with 76 in 2021, said he wasn't allowed to participate in the contest because he was \"banned\" from the event after allegedly partnering with a competing brand to Nathan's Famous.\n\n\"I was very disappointed to learn from the media today that after nearly 20 years I am banned from the Nathan's 4th of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\" he wrote on Instagram at the time. \"I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title.\"\n\nIn response to the competitive eater's claims he was \"banned,\" Major League Eating (MLE) told TODAY.com in a statement that that was not accurate.\n\n\"There is no ban. Major League Eating wants him there. The fans want him there. Nathan's wants him there,\" Richard Shea, MLE co-founder, said.\n\nMLE also sent TODAY.com a statement that said, in part, \"We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest.\"\n\nDuring the broadcast on July 4, the announcers repeatedly emphasized that it was Chestnuts \"choice\" not be involved this year.\n\nBefore the competition began, ESPN paid tribute to Chestnut and called him \"the Babe Ruth of beef\" among other titles. The broadcast also pointed out that his last win at the competition came in 2015. It then compared the breakup between Chestnut and Nathan's Hot Dogs to The Beatles splitting up.\n\nAlthough he didn't make it to Nathan's Famous, fans of competitive eating will still get to enjoy the sight of Chestnut wolfing down hot dogs on Independence Day. Chestnut opted to compete against soldiers at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, in a five-minute hot-dog-eating event, which was previously reported by Associated Press on June 27.\n\nThe annual July 4th event, called \"Pop Goes the Fort,\" will also feature a firework display and performances by the El Paso Symphony Orchestra and the 1st Armored Division Band.", "source": {"uri": "today.com",

It's OK to experiment with a new dog. Meat eaters shouldn't have to be exclusive to just one wiener.\"\n\nChestnut is set to compete against his longtime rival Kobayashi, a six-time winner of Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, in an all-beef hot dog eating contest titled Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef.

The 38-year-old dental hygenist bested not only her event-winning total from last year (39 1/2 hot dogs) but also the previous world record (48 1/2 hot dogs) - the record that Sudo set. To give you a sense of just how big the margin of victory was for Sudo among the other 14 competitors, second place went to Japan's Mayoi Ebihara - with 37 hot dogs.\n\nOn the men's side, things were much closer - but it would be Illionois' Patrick Bertoletti who would take the crown. Though no world records were broke, the competition itself proved to be a competitive one. In the end, The 39-year-old would knock down 58 hot dogs - with Massachusetts's Geoffrey Esper taking second with 53 hot dogs and Australian James Webb taking third with 52 hot dogs. Bertoletti's performance saw the professional eater besting his result from the last time he competed in the summer event (33 1/2 hot dogs in 2022) and his personal best of 55 hot dogs.\n\n\"I was gutted to learn from the media that after 19 years, I'm banned from the Nathan's July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest. I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th, and I have been training to defend my title,\" Chestnut shared in a tweet/x response when news that he was barred from the competition last month. Major League Eating announced that it prohibited Chestnut from competing over his deal to be a spokesperson for Impossible Foods and the company's plant-based hot dogs - which smacks in the face of the brand exclusivity rules associated with Nathan's event.\n\nHe continued, \"To set the record straight, I do not have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.This is apparently the basis on which I'm being banned, and it doesn't impact the July 4th event. Sadly, this is the decision Nathan's and Major League Eating are making, and it will deprive the great fans of the holiday's usual joy and entertainment. To my fans, I love you and appreciate you. Rest assured that you'll see me eat again soon!! STAY HUNGRY!\"\n\nChestnut remains the current record-holder with 76 hotdogs in 2021, with the 16-time hot dog-eating champion set to go one-on-one with his rival, six-time hot dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi.

She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nWith the event's biggest star -- - Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut -- out of the contest this year, Sudo's result set up a possible scenario in which the women's champ out-eats the men's winner.

Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture.

The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\n\"I'm going to be pushing myself,\" Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMajor League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami. The company will also donate to an organization supporting military families based on the number of hot dogs eaten at the event, a spokesperson said.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

The 39-year-old Bertoletti defeated 13 competitors from around the world in a test to see who can wolf down the most hot dogs in 10 minutes.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done,\" Bertoletti said.\n\nBertoletti bested his prior record of 55 hot dogs at the event, held every Independence Day on New York's Coney Island.\n\nThe reigning men's champion, Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, didn't attend the competition this year over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, Chestnut will compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. Chestnut won 16 out of 17 previous competitions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nBertoletti's victory marks the first time the famed mustard belt has gone to someone besides Chestnut since 2015.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture.\n\nCompetitors came from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\nLast year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMajor League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami. The company will also donate to an organization supporting military families based on the number of hot dogs eaten at the event, a spokesperson said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In the middle of the contest, James Webb of Australia briefly took the lead. Bertoletti came rallying back, and held onto the lead until the end.\n\nChestnut, the 16-time champion did not appear this year because of his partnership with a rival company that makes plant-based hot dogs. He's appearing instead this year at Fort Bliss in Texas, where he'll compete against four service members at 5 p.m.\n\nChestnut holds the all-time record which he set in 2021 by eating 76 hot dogs and buns.\n\nMiki Sudo sets new record in women's division\n\nMiki Sudo set a new record in the women's division at the 2024 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest with 51 hot dogs and buns.\n\nSudo, 38, has won every year since 2014 except 2021 - she sat that year out due to pregnancy. Her personal best had previously been 48.5 hot dogs and buns, which she shattered this year with 51.\n\nSudo successfully defended her title for the tenth time. As Major League Eating's top-ranked female eater in the world, Sudo fended off a stiff challenge from Mayoi Ebihara of Japan, who ate 37.\n\nSudo thanked Ebihara for \"pushing me so much.\"\n\nSudo said she was \"getting emotional\" and \"really wanted to win.\"\n\nSudo is married to fellow competitor Nicholas Wehry. With 51, she has now bested his total, which is 48.\n\nMichelle Lesco came in third in the women's division with 23 hot dogs and buns.\n\nThousands of spectators attended the annual spectacle at Nathan's Famous flagship restaurant at Surf and Stillwell Avenues. The show also included dance and music performances.\n\nThe Fourth of July tradition dates back to 1916.\n\nIn addition to winning the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt, there's a $20,000 cash prize.\n\nAt Thursday's event, Eric \"Badlands\" Booker set a new record in the Nathan's lemonade chugging competition, consuming a gallon in 21 seconds.\n\nAnd, as per tradition, Nathan's Famous is donating

Donate today\n\nNathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest has crowned a new king for the first time in nine years, officially ending the reign of former king and 16-time winner Joey Chestnut.\n\nPatrick \"Pat\" Bertoletti from Chicago, Illinois won this year's men's competition and the coveted Mustard Belt, eating 58 hot dogs in 10 minutes, a personal record.\n\nCompetitors were neck and neck for much of the ten-minute race. Geoffrey Esper from Oxford, Massachusetts, came in second place with 53 franks.\n\nChestnut was forced to sit out this year's hot dog contest after signing a deal with rival brand Impossible Foods, which makes vegan franks and burgers. The Kentucky native won all but one competition of the past 16 years he's competed.\n\nChestnut turned in a world record-breaking performance in 2021, eating 75 hot dogs and buns. He took home last year's victory after eating 62 franks.\n\nThis year, Chestnut was instead thousands of miles away from New York City, at the Fort Bliss Army post in Texas, for a hot-dog eating contest and fundraiser for military families set to begin at 2 p.m. He posted a photo on Instagram atop a military tank, advertising the event's livestream link earlier Thursday morning.\n\nMajor League Eating spokesperson George Shea previously said he was \"devastated\" to lose the prolific competition eater.\n\nThe contest has been an annual tradition since 1972, according to Nathan's Famous.\n\nElise Candreva from Long Island was at Coney Island to watch the competition.\n\n\"It's a little bit disgusting,\" she said, \"But I'm here for it and I support anyone who's gonna attempt to eat that many hot dogs in ten minutes.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Miki Sudo won the women's division with a new record, eating 51 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes. The second-place finisher was Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, who ate 37 hot dogs and buns.\n\nThe winner in each division takes home $10,000 and the runner-up takes home $5,000.", "source": {"uri":

In doing so, he surpassed his previous personal best of 55 hotdogs.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done,\" Bertoletti said.\n\nThe 39-year-old defeated 13 competitors from around the world. But the main story was the absence of the 16-time men's champion, Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, who didn't attend the competition this year after a sponsorship tiff.\n\nLast year Chestnut chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76. But Chestnut was initially disinvited from this year's event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a plant-based meat company. Major League Eating, which organizes the Nathan's Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nInstead, he was scheduled to eat at an event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso later on Thursday. The competition will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nChestnut's absence from the Nathan's competition was big enough news for New York's mayor, Eric Adams, to become involved. Adams said on X that all parties involved should \"stop being such weenies\". He said it would be \"impossible\" to hold the contest without Chestnut, adding, \"Let's find a way to squash this beef and bring back the champ ...\"\n\nChestnut, who is estimated to have made $4m from competitive eating last year, is also scheduled to face his long-time rival, Takeru Kobayashi, in a showdown on Netflix in September.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, defending champion Miki Sudo of Florida won her 10th title in the women's division. Sudo consumed 51 hotdogs in 10 minutes, setting a new women's world record.\n\n\"I'm just happy to call this mine for another year,\" Sudo said after winning her 10th title.\n\nSudo defeated 13 competitors from around the world Thursday, including her 28-year-old rival, Mayoi Ebihara of Japan. Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hotdogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023.\n\nThousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island. Competitors came from more than a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_(horse_color)",

In the end, she was just seven franks away from beating out men's champion Bertoletti.\n\n\"I finally hit that milestone because I had competition pushing me,\" Sudo told reporters after the face-off, adding it was great to know that \"if I'd just pushed a little bit harder, I would have beat a lot of the guys, too.\"\n\nSudo said she had more to give, but is already looking ahead to next year's contest. Hopefully, she said, the weather will be as calm as this year, and the crowd -- which Sudo lovingly referred to as \"a constant\" -- will bring the same exciting energy.\n\n\"I see [my] numbers going up 10%,\" she said of 2025.\n\nThis year's contest was notably different from previous years due to the absence of 16-time champion Chestnut. Major League Eating (MLE) announced last month that it was parting ways with Chestnut, citing a rule prohibiting participants from striking endorsement deals with rivals of Nathan's, the contest's primary sponsor.\n\nChestnut's departure left the competition wide open, setting the stage for new champions to rise. Chestnut's personal best was 76 hot dogs downed during the contest in 2021. Last year, he faced 62.\n\n\"This was the best contest, in terms of competition, that I've seen in more than a decade,\" Shea told Brooklyn Paper and amNewYork Metro. \"We had four or five eaters going back and forth, but finally, Patrick Bertoletti set his own personal best -- 58 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes -- to win this contest. Chicago is cheering right now.\"\n\nBertoletti, a seasoned competitor known for his impressive eating feats, seized the opportunity to clinch the title. His performance was both strategic and relentless, outpacing his rivals in a tightly contested battle.\n\nIn the women's division, Sudo reaffirmed her dominance.

Chestnut has held the title since 2016, but now a new champion has been crowned.\n\nPatrick \"Deep Dish\" Bertolleti has officially taken the 2024 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Championship by consuming 58 hot dogs in 10 minutes. This is a new personal best for Bertolleti, who previously secured 55 hot dogs in 2009.\n\nBertolleti returned to compete in 2022 in Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest after a 10-year retirement, consuming 33.5 hot dogs, which was good for fifth place. Now, a mere two years later, he is now the 2024 champion.\n\nChestnut has been one of the most dominant champions in the competitive eating game, securing the Nathan's title a record 16 times. However, some drama led to Chestnut being banned from this year's contest.\n\nChestnut had apparently signed a deal with a vegan hot dog company, leading to Nathan's not allowing the former champion to compete. Chestnut took to X to break down what led to his ban.\n\nAccording to his post:\n\n\"(1/3)I was gutted to learn from the media that after 19 years Im banned from the Nathan's July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest. I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title.\"\n\n\"(2/3)To set the record straight, I do not have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.This is apparently the basis on which I'm being banned, and it doesn't impact the July 4th event.\"\n\n\"(3/3) Sadly, this is the decision Nathan's and Major League Eating are making, and it will deprive the great fans of the holiday's usual joy and entertainment. To my fans, I love you and appreciate you. Rest assured that you'll see me eat again soon!! STAY HUNGRY!\"\n\nInstead of competing in the contest in 2024, Chestnut is pivoting to face his former foe, Takeru Kobayashi, in a one-on-one hot dog eating contest on Netflix. The aptly titled \"Unfinished Beef\" special will take place on Sep. 2.\n\nThere is no telling if Chestnut will return to compete with Nathan's in the future, but Bertolleti will need to ensure he stays in eating shape to combat Chestnut -- who consumed a record 76 hot dogs in 2021.\n\nChestnut consumed 63 in 2023 to win the coveted Mustard Belt, and Bertolleti could catch that number in 2025 with some more training.

The 40-year-old is still going to put his jaws to the test in a contest against American soldiers at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. Chestnut announced his participation last week.\n\nIn a different format from the 10-minute, all-you-can-eat individual contest Nathan's holds annually, Chestnut will go head-to-head against a group of four soldiers trying to dethrone the hot dog messiah collectively in a five-minute contest. The event will stream on Chestnut's YouTube channel hours after the Nathan's Famous contest.\n\nThe Fort Bliss contest will serve as a precursor for Chestnut's hot dog endeavors in 2024. The eating legend is set to face his old rival Takeru Kobayashi in a one-on-one hot dog eating contest on Labor Day to be live-streamed on Netflix. Kobayashi won six consecutive Nathan's contests before Chestnut began his reign in 2007.\n\nJoey Chestnut on ban, relationship with MLE\n\nChestnut is not the first and likely won't be the last competitive eater to get into a contractual dispute with Major League Eating. The organization showed that no one competitor is above others with their ruling on Chestnut, but it potentially stung its relationship with its most marketable star.\n\nChestnut was blindsided by the news of his ban and how MLE handled the situation.\n\n\"Everything with Impossible was perfectly fine by all my previous agreements. They [MLE] changed terms and conditions [around] exclusivity,\" Chestnut said, per Emma Baccallieri of Sports Illustrated. \"And it's not the first time they've changed some things, but it's the first time they've really changed things after the fact, and I had to say, \"Hey, it's too late, I've already started working with this brand.\" This was never an issue in the past. And they tried to dance around it -- they changed a lot of terms, and then they escalated things to a degree they didn't imagine when they started leaking information and telling people I was banned and that I turned vegan, which clearly isn't the case.\"\n\nMLE, run by brothers George and Richard Shea, said in a statement that it conceded the sponsorship issue with Chestnut following his ban. Still, the sides could not agree to new terms, with Chestnut opting to head to the army base in Texas instead.\n\nDespite not competing this year, Joey Chestnut hopes to return in 2025 or at least be in a more formal competition next July 4.\n\n\"I don't think the Shea brothers are bad people. I'm not burning any bridges. And I love it -- I love the Fourth of July and that contest. I'm always willing to try. I don't hold grudges. So nothing is out of the question,\" Chestnut said.\n\nShow goes on for Nathan's Famous without star\n\nMajor League Eating doesn't want to miss a beat without Joey Chestnut. Maybe banning its biggest star makes the men's contest more appealing this year with a wide-open field.\n\nOn the men's side, it's expected to be a two-horse race between Geoffrey Esper and James Webb. The second and fifth-ranked competitive eaters, respectively, Esper and Webb are the odds-on favorites with the winning number projected to sit around the 50 hot dogs and buns mark.\n\nOn the women's side, Miki Sudo cleaned up again by setting a women's record with 51 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. It is Sudo's 10th title, winning each of her last 10 appearances in the contest. (Sudo did not compete in 2021 due to her pregnancy).", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_meyers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Meyers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_(horse_color)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chestnut (horse color)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competitive eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Famous", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Famous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bliss", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fort Bliss"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Bliss"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeru_Kobayashi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeru Kobayashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (condiment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Joey-Chestnuts-Fourth-of-July-plans-after-Nathan-Hot-Dogs-Eating-Contest-ban.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 642, "textEnd": 649}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 3212, "textEnd": 3218}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Miki Sudo set a new record in the women's division with 51 wieners downed. After the beef between Chestnut and MLE, the contest was considered much more wide open than in the past several years.\n\nMLE announced last month that it was parting ways with Chestnut, citing a rule that participants cannot strike endorsement deals with rivals of hot dog maker Nathan's. MLE alleged at the time that Chestnut had partnered with a plant-based meat alternative company. Chestnut, also known as \"Jaws,\" has recently begun posting images on Instagram that feature Impossible Foods.\n\n\"For nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions,\" the MLE said in a statement in June. \"However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our long-time relationship.\"\n\nChestnut responded in a statement at the time that he was \"gutted to learn from the media\" of his banishment after 19 years. The 40-year-old claimed he did not have a contract with MLE or Nathan's, and said the endorsement ban was a departure from the organization's rules around partnerships in prior years.\n\n\"I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title,\" he said last month.\n\nWhile the relationship appears fried for the time being, the MLE called Chestnut an \"American hero\" and said it would \"love\" for him to return when not representing a Nathan's competitor. Chestnut holds eating records in 55 categories, including eggs, chicken wings and apple pies, the MLE told NBC News.\n\nNathan's website also still showers Chestnut in praise. In a section announcing his 2023 win, the New York-based company wrote that \"there's no doubt in our mind who's the king.\"\n\nDuring ESPN's broadcast of the 2024 contest, the channel made several mentions of Chestnut and what the competition looks like without him. In one reference, Chestnut was referred to as the \"Warren Buffett of the buffet.\"\n\nChestnut fans can still see him in action this holiday.\n\nHe's livestreaming a hot dog eating contest from the Fort Bliss army base at Texas as a fundraiser for charity, according to a recent Instagram post. The show begins at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\n\"The 4th wouldn't be the same if I wasn't celebrating by eating a whole lot of all-beef hot dogs,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_harring@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Alex Harring", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_(horse_color)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chestnut (horse color)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bertoletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Bertoletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (condiment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_alternative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat alternative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple pie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/108001751-17201122762024-07-04t165504z_1308948852_rc2go8a20puz_rtrmadp_0_usa-julyfourth-nathans.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 149}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

(Somehow, that was 14 frankfurters shy of his record-setting 76 franks in 2021.)\n\nPrior to the men's competition, Miki Sudo won the women's title, scarfing down a record-setting 51 weenies in 10 minutes, besting her year-ago victory by 11-and-a-half weenies.

For nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions.

For the first time in 15 years, Chestnut will face off with his longtime rival Takeru Kobayashi in a one-on-one match up.

He surpassed his personal best of 55 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Sudo, on the other hand, ate 51 hot dogs, setting a new world record for women.

However, he will compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later today.\n\nThe competitive eater has won the Nathan's event a total of 16 times (out of his 19 attempts), including every year since 2016. However, when Chestnut inked a deal as a spokesperson for Impossible Foods, which launched a plant-based hot dog this year, Major League Eating claimed he went against the brand's exclusivity rules for the competition.\n\n\"For nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions,\" Major League Eating said in a statement in June. \"However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our long-time relationship.\"\n\nIn response to the news that he would not be allowed to compete in the hot dog eating contest, Chestnut released his own statement, noting that he was \"gutted\" to learn from the media that he was banned.\n\n\"To set the record straight, I do not have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). \"Sadly, this is the decision Nathan's and Major League Eating are making, and it will deprive the great fans of the holiday's usual joy and entertainment.\"\n\nWhile Chestnut did not take the stage in Coney Island this year, it doesn't mean his fans can't see him chow down on some hot dogs this summer. The competitive eater will compete against his \"fiercest rival,\" Takeru Kobayashi, during a hot dog eating contest airing live on Netflix on Labor Day, Sept. 2.\n\nThe special will be called Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef, with the location and timing still TBD. It will reunite the rivals for the first time since 2009 when Chestnut beat Kobayashi in a five hot dog sudden death eat-off.\n\n\"Through all of my years in competitive eating, Kobayashi stands out as my fiercest rival,\" Chestnut said in a statement when the special was announced. \"Competing against him pushed me to be so much better. I know that fans have waited a long time for another chapter of our rivalry, and I can't wait for our massive showdown live on Netflix! It's time to give the people what they want!\"\n\nKobayashi, on the other hand, had retired from competitive eating but Netflix coaxed him into one last frank-eating challenge.\n\n\"Retiring for me will only happen after I take him down one last time,\" Kobayashi said. \"This rivalry has been brewing for a long time.

He sat out this year's competition due to a contract dispute resulting from his deal with Impossible Foods, which makes vegetable-based weiners.\n\nChestnut planned to compete in a 5 p.m. competition with U.S Troops at Fort Bliss in Texas.

See video below.\n\nGoing into the contest, the favorite to take Chestnut's place at the top was James Webb, an Australian ex-pro soccer player. Competitors from around the world tried for the title including eaters from Brazil and the Czech Republic.\n\nAn hour ago, Miki Sudo won the women's competition with a record-setting 51 hot dogs in 10 minutes, taking the title for the 10th time. She bested her win last year by 11 and a half dogs (and this year's second place competitor Mayoi Ebihara of Japan by 14). Sudo is studying to be a dental hygienist in Tampa, and after her win today thanked her dental school as well as her family.\n\nThe face-stuffing competition - this year was the 108th - is a Fourth of July tradition in New York perhaps second only to Macy's annual fireworks display, and Chestnut's forced absence after endorsing the vegan dogs seemed to increase the contest's national profile this year. Even CNN has been watching the frankfurter developments today.\n\nChestnut, despite his recent endorsement deal with the plant-based Impossible Foods, apparently is not vegan himself - he competed in a bologna-eating contest in May.\n\nThe hot dog contest was shown live in the United States on ESPN2 and ESPN3. It will re-air on ESPN twice tonight. The Chestnut-less men's competition was scheduled to start around noon ET outside Nathan's, yes, famous, Coney Island hot dog stand.

Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Prize Money: How much could the winner make in this contest?\n\nThe Fourth of July is a holiday that offers the people of the United States plenty of options when it comes to entertainment, whether it be fireworks, pool parties, BBQs or fairs.\n\nHowever, one of the biggest events on the day is Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. The event usually takes place outside the original Nathan's location in Coney Island near Brooklyn.\n\nThe contest famously had to change its tradition in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the event taking place in a private location.\n\nWhile there are rumors the event first took place in 1916, the first official July Fourth contest took place in 1972 on Coney Island.\n\nAs per Major League Eating (MLE), the company that has managed the event since 1997, entrants must be under contract to MLE to participate. Past campions and other special MLE invitees also take part, while aspiring eaters can also qualify via preliminary contests.\n\nDuring the event, participants must eat as many Nathan's Famous hot dogs in buns as they can within a 10 minute period. Each contestant is assigned their own scorekeeper who keeps track of how many hot dogs are eaten during the contest.\n\nAccording to information shared with Mashed, winners of Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest from both the men's and women's competitions receive a healthy sum of $10,000.\n\nThis is a great payday for ten minutes of work. The second, third, fourth, and fifth-place winners of the men's and women's competitions are also awarded for their efforts, receiving $5,000, $2,500, $1,500, and $1,000, respectively. This adds up to $40,000 in total prize money.\n\nWhile Joey Chestnut is the top male champion of al time with 15 titles, he has been banned from competing after signing a marketing agreement with Impossible Foods, a rival of Nathan's.\n\nMike Sudo is the top female champion, winning nine titles.\n\nAdding to her legacy Miki Sudo won her tenth title by setting a new woman's record, eating 51 hot dogs. That smashed her performance from last year, when she won by eating 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Famous", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Famous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_&_World_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. News & World Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/b69dd784a2f60d563c5825bb12c52279/crop/0x0/2044x1363/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/04/17201052703411.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Miki Sudo set a new record in the women's division with 51 wieners downed. After the beef between Chestnut and MLE, the contest was considered much more wide open than in the past several years.\n\nMLE announced last month that it was parting ways with Chestnut, citing a rule that participants cannot strike endorsement deals with rivals of hot dog maker Nathan's. MLE alleged at the time that Chestnut had partnered with a plant-based meat alternative company. Chestnut, also known as \"Jaws,\" has recently begun posting images on Instagram that feature Impossible Foods.\n\n\"For nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions,\" the MLE said in a statement in June. \"However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our long-time relationship.\"\n\nChestnut responded in a statement at the time that he was \"gutted to learn from the media\" of his banishment after 19 years. The 40-year-old claimed he did not have a contract with MLE or Nathan's, and said the endorsement ban was a departure from the organization's rules around partnerships in prior years.\n\n\"I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title,\" he said last month.\n\nWhile the relationship appears fried for the time being, the MLE called Chestnut an \"American hero\" and said it would \"love\" for him to return when not representing a Nathan's competitor. Chestnut holds eating records in 55 categories, including eggs, chicken wings and apple pies, the MLE told NBC News.\n\nNathan's website also still showers Chestnut in praise. In a section announcing his 2023 win, the New York-based company wrote that \"there's no doubt in our mind who's the king.\"\n\nDuring ESPN's broadcast of the 2024 contest, the channel made several mentions of Chestnut and what the competition looks like without him. In one reference, Chestnut was referred to as the \"Warren Buffett of the buffet.\"\n\nChestnut fans can still see him in action this holiday.\n\nHe's livestreaming a hot dog eating contest from the Fort Bliss army base at Texas as a fundraiser for charity, according to a recent Instagram post. The show begins at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\n\"The 4th wouldn't be the same if I wasn't celebrating by eating a whole lot of all-beef hot dogs,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_(horse_color)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chestnut (horse color)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bertoletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Bertoletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (condiment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_alternative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat alternative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple pie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/07/108001751-17201122762024-07-04t165504z_1308948852_rc2go8a20puz_rtrmadp_0_usa-julyfourth-nathans.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 318}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Bertoletti won after eating a total of 58 hot dogs. He came into the event as Major League Eating's No. 9-ranked eater in the world.\n\nInstead of participating in the Nathan's Famous contest in Coney Island, Chestnut will be doing a live event later today. He'll eat hot dogs against several members of the U.S. Military. Last year, he won the Nathan's Famous contest by downing 62 dogs.\n\nDespite his ban this year, Chestnut has stated that he's not opposed to competing in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in the future, even if there is tension right now.\n\nThis week, Chestnut shared his side of how it got to the point that he wouldn't be competing. He is arguing that the terms of his agreements were changed and that information was leaked.\n\n\"Everything with Impossible was perfectly fine by all my previous agreements,\" Chestnut said. \"They changed terms and conditions [around] exclusivity. And it's not the first time they've changed some things, but it's the first time they've really changed things after the fact, and I had to say, 'Hey, it's too late, I've already started working with this brand.' This was never an issue in the past.\"\n\nChestnut says information was leaked about him, including blatant misinformation.\n\n\"And they tried to dance around it -- they changed a lot of terms, and then they escalated things to a degree they didn't imagine when they started leaking information and telling people I was banned and that I turned vegan, which clearly isn't the case,\" Chestnut said.\n\nFormer Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest winner Takeru Kobayashi called it a career last month after revealing the strain competitive eating has put on his body in a Netflix documentary. He last competed in the July Fourth contest in 2009. His nemesis, Joey Chestnut, beat him with 68 hot dogs eaten to 64.5 hot dogs after an eat-off contest in 2008.\n\nAt the 2010 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, Kobayashi was famously arrested after appearing on stage in the event, after he was banned from competing due to an exclusivity issue with his contract. He claimed he was not trying to compete until the crowd egged him on.\n\nIn 2024, Kobayashi decided to call it quits. On \"Hack Your Health,\" on Netflix, Kobayashi detailed how his many years of competitive eating left his body in an unsustainable state.\n\n\"I hear people say they're hungry, and they look very happy after they've eaten. I'm jealous of those people because I no longer feel hunger,\" he said in the documentary. \"I hope to live a long and healthy life.\"\n\nDespite his official retirement, Kobayashi will eat against Chestnut in a special Netflix live event on Labor Day.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki Chavanelle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Famous", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Famous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bertoletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Bertoletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeru_Kobayashi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takeru Kobayashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/07/03091758/Nathans-Hot-Dog-Eating-Contest.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Fans of dudes and ladies who can stuff their faces with disgusting amounts of food were no doubt broken up about Chestnut's inability to defend his championship belt, but that created an opening for other professional eaters to make history.\n\nThat's what Patrick Bertoletti did in the annual Fourth of July competition. Unfortunately for him, he started competing in 2007 -- right at the start of Chestnut's run during which he only lost the hot dog eating contest once (in 2015). Bertoletti had multiple second- and third-place finishes in that span before his initial retirement in 2015. He placed fifth during the 2022 contest after a decade-long hiatus.\n\nThe Chicago native sat out last year's edition, but got back on the horse this time around and prevailed with a total of 58 hot dogs and buns that I guess were added up after the final horn.\n\nI saw Bertoletti listed as high as 10-1 odds at some places, but +750 is still a great ROI for any bettors who took the action.\n\nBertoletti must've just had to work himself back into game shape, because upon his initial return to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest two years ago, he managed only 33.5 hot dogs and buns. Hell of a time to step up without Chestnut in the field. Chestnut's personal best is 76, and he won each of the last two times with totals of 63 and 62 respectively.\n\nNobody can really f**k with that guy. Not to take anything away from Bertoletti's achievement. At some point Chestnut had to leave some room for the rest of his peers one way or another, right? Can only imagine what Chestnut's insides look like given all those 'dogs and other unhealthy foodstuffs he's consumed rapid-fire style over the years.\n\nWhat a call by this guy, by the way, who cited Bertoletti's recent track record as proof that he could edge out the rest of the field.\n\nThe only nickname I've seen for Bertoletti is \"Deep Dish.\" An obvious nod to his Windy City roots. That's a built-in advantage in and of itself. If you grow up in Chicago with professional eating aspirations, you can get plenty of good practice on deep dish pizza. That stuff is no joke. I bet Bertoletti had his fair share of that upon coming out of retirement to get himself ready to seize glory on Independence Day.\n\nNice to see some fresh blood in the hot dog eating contest, even if Bertoletti is catching some heat for sloppy eating in the aftermath of his win.

He said it's important to stay loose and try to \"stay empty for the 4th.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Hot_Dog_Eating_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perennial plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (condiment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-based_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plant-based diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WBZ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/04/30d3704e-ce74-4f19-950c-f5ff43d58287/thumbnail/1200x630/2a16eee79f01e326a1848f1e91619eee/gettyimages-1516676646-2.jpg?v=57e8061b2038d609da26e467de5ddfb8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Here's how many calories he consumed.", "body": "Another Fourth of July means another round of Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest -- and lots of calories consumed.\n\nPatrick Bertoletti took home the winning title Thursday by consuming 58 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes at the event on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. In the women's category, Miki Sudo won her 10th title, downing 51 hot dogs and buns.\n\nLast year, Joey Chestnut capped off his longtime winning streak by consuming 62 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. This year, Chestnut was banned from the contest due to his partnership with Impossible Foods, a rival company that makes plant-based hot dogs.\n\nHere's the nutrition breakdown from the latest weiner-eating winners.\n\nAccording to the nutrition facts of Nathan's products, a serving size of one Original Coney Island natural casing beef frank contains 170 calories (according to the company's website; other varieties vary) and one of Nathan's restaurant-style buns contains 130 calories.\n\nThat means for the 58 hot dogs and buns gobbled down by Bertoletti this year, the calories of the franks would have equaled 9,860 and the buns added another 7,540 calories -- for a grand total of 17,400 calories consumed.\n\nSudo's 51 hot dogs and buns totaled 15,300 calories.\n\nLast year, Chestnut's win equaled 10,540 for the franks and 8,060 calories for the buns -- for a grand total of 18,600 calories consumed. For his record-setting year in 2021 -- 76 hot dogs and buns consumed -- his total would have reached a whopping 22,800 calories!\n\nNathan's natural casing beef franks also include 16 grams of total fat and 480 milligrams of sodium per dog -- so one hot dog accounts for about 21% of your daily recommended values for each.\n\nWith 58 franks eaten this year, Bertoletti's total fat and sodium intake equaled 928 grams and 27,840 milligrams, respectively.\n\nDiets higher in sodium are associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, a major cause of stroke and heart disease.\n\nThe side effects of such enormous binges vary based on the individual and the food being eaten, but as CBS News has previously reported, side effects of competitive eating can include nausea, painful gas, vomiting, heartburn and diarrhea. More serious side effects could include choking, esophageal inflammation and potentially even stomach rupture.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News last year, Major League Eating, the world body that oversees professional eating contests -- including Nathan's Famous Hot Dot Eating Contest -- says all of its events adhere to \"strict safety protocols,\" including having an emergency medical technician present at events and ensuring participants are 18 years of age or older.\n\n\"Do not try speed eating (at) home,\" the group warns on its website.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miki_Sudo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miki Sudo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bertoletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Bertoletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-based_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant-based diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan's_Famous", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan's Famous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal perforation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive eating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Choking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heartburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical technician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esophagus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Pet_Food_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Pet Food Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/03/7e56d0f5-f9b0-49cf-bc40-fc8309d7b806/thumbnail/1200x630/50c77059d39e32b3439218099f922b3e/gettyimages-1514099374.jpg?v=57e8061b2038d609da26e467de5ddfb8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707112", "eventUri": "eng-9707112", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Get to Know the Women's Hot Dog Eating Champion", "body": "Miki Sudo set a new record during Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest -- but she's been a champ for years prior.\n\nSudo, 38, became a reigning winner on Thursday, July 4, when she ate a world record-breaking 51 dogs in 10 minutes. This marked the 10th time that Sudo won the annual contest after getting her start in 2014.\n\nWhile Sudo came from Florida to defend her title, other competitors travel from all over the world to take part in the Coney Island tradition. Some contestants have arrived from places such as Brazil, Japan, the U.K., South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic to fight for the coveted title in men's and women's divisions and the $10,000 prize money.\n\nKeep scrolling for everything to know about Sudo following her big win:\n\nSudo won the women's championship at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest every year from 2014 to 2020 after unseating Sonya Thomas, who was previously the winner since the competition's 2011 inception. Before entering the world of hot dog eating, Sudo got her start in a 2013 pho eating contest.\n\nSudo -- who is currently studying to become a dental hygienist -- became Major League Eating's top-ranked female competitive eater in 2014 before reaching the top three the following year. She also holds four world records in Kimchi, Hotdish, ice cream and hot dogs.\n\nAccording to Sudo, her decision to become a professional competitive eater started on a whim.\n\n\"I've always been one to try new things and always down for adventure, so I just kind of decided to give it a try and I plugged away,\" Sudo told Newsweek in July 2023 about how she entered her first contest out of curiosity. \"I finished this challenge, and then they put me up on a billboard and they started getting requests to do other challenges. Once I realized that there was a competitive circuit, that's when my competitive streak really got the best of me. Here I am, over 10 years later.\"\n\nThe only year Sudo didn't compete was 2021 because she was 37 weeks pregnant with her son. She still attended the hot dog eating contest as a commentator for ESPN and went on to win for the eighth time the following year.\n\nSudo shares son Max with husband Nick Wehry -- who is also a competitive eater.\n\n\"We like to say we didn't choose competitive eating, competitive eating chose us,\" Sudo told ABC in July 2024. \"I met the love of my life and we have a beautiful son together.\"\n\nThe couple first met when Sudo introduced herself and asked him to take a picture at the gym where they were working out before an eating competition. One year later, the duo reconnected when a mutual friend suggested they try dating.\n\n\"I thought she wouldn't give me the time of day!\" Wehry, who is ranked No. 4 in competitive eating worldwide, added in 2024. \"But fortunately she did, and fast forward to now.\"\n\nWehry opened up about his own accomplishments, adding, \"I was a competitive bodybuilder for about 10 years and when that stopped I needed another outlet. My appetite was a running joke and somebody said, 'You can raise money for charity, get free food, and win money.' I am in, I am so in!\"\n\n\"I like to take care of myself, and for me, that includes a lot of cardio because it helps me build up my tolerance, especially for exerting all that energy outside under the New York sun,\" Sudo told Newsweek in 2023. \"Generally, I just try to take care of my health overall.\"\n\nSudo noted at the time that she was trying to perfect her approach, adding, \"I'm just kind of tweaking my technique to hopefully put up a higher number because I do not like my personal record. It's just a very arbitrary kind of number. I'd like to hit 50. Really, I don't even want to hang it up until I get to that 50 mark, and I don't see why I couldn't.\"\n\nOver the years, Sudo has competed in contests involving pies, cakes, chili, shrimp cocktails, turkey, gumbo, pasta, pumpkins, buffalo wings, tamales, tacos and more.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The 39-year-old Bertoletti defeated 13 competitors from around the world in a test to see who can wolf down the most hot dogs in 10 minutes.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop eating until the job was done,\" Bertoletti said.\n\nBertoletti bested his prior record of 55 hot dogs at the event, held every Independence Day on New York's Coney Island.\n\nThe reigning men's champion, Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, didn't attend the competition this year over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, Chestnut will compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. Chestnut won 16 out of 17 previous competitions.\n\nBertoletti said he lost weight and practiced for three months with \"an urgency\" to prepare for Thursday's event, thinking he had a good chance of winning.\n\n\"With Joey not here, I knew I had a shot,\" he said. \"I was able to unlock something that I don't know where it came from. But I'm not complaining.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, defending champion Miki Sudo of Florida won her 10th title in the women's division.\n\nSudo consumed 51 hot dogs in 10 minutes -- and set a new world record for women.\n\n\"I'm just happy to call this mine for another year,\" Sudo said after winning her 10th pink belt.\n\nThe 38-year-old dental hygiene student won last year after forcing down 39 1/2 hot dogs.\n\nSudo defeated 13 competitors, including 28-year-old rival Mayoi Ebihara of Japan. Ebihara came in second after eating 37 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She was also the runner-up in 2023. Sudo also consumed more than her partner, former Florida bodybuilder Nicholas Wehry, who ate 46 hot dogs in the men's competition.\n\nBertoletti's victory marks the first time the famed mustard belt has gone to someone besides Chestnut since 2015.\n\nThousands of fans, some wearing foam hot dog hats, flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan's location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. Rich Shea, CEO of Major League Eating, which organizes the event, noted how people still came out in droves even though Chestnut was not there.\n\n\"Just a great competitor, a great guy, a grown man, and a man who's made a choice not to be here today,\" he said of the popular eating champ on ESPN. \"But fortunately for us, tens of thousands of people are crowding around Nathan's Famous. It's a pilgrimage every year. This is not a paid Hollywood crowd. This is excitement.\"\n\nCompetitors came from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.\n\nLast year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.\n\nChestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes and which advertised on ESPN throughout the event on Thursday.\n\nMajor League Eating has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.\n\nChestnut said he wouldn't return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.\n\nThe event at the Fort Bliss army base in El Paso, scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET, will use traditional franks, with Chestnut attempting to out-eat four soldiers in five minutes.\n\nEven though he won't be eating their vegan products, Impossible Foods is promoting Chestnut's YouTube livestream of the exhibition by flying airplanes with banners over Los Angeles and Miami. The company will also donate to an organization supporting military families based on the number of hot dogs eaten at the event, a spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "houstonchronicle.com",

The recommended sodium level is no more than 2,300 milligrams each day, just shy of five hot dogs.\n\nAnd the high fat can lead to nausea, diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson Debbie Petitpain told CBS News.\n\nHowever, experts said as long as these competitors return to regular eating, their bodies should also return to normal.\n\nLegendary hotdog eater Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut, who won the competition 16 times, said he trains for every Nathan's contest for three months straight by performing mouth exercises to strengthen his mouth and throat.\n\n'Every practice, I record it and I try to push a little bit harder and figure out what I can do differently,' Chestnut said in 2021.\n\nWHO LET THE DOGS OUT: People wore hot dog costumes at a parking lot in Coney Island, NYC\n\n'You can only practice so much. If I practice too much I start gaining weight, and if I start gaining weight then I start slowing down. So it's a weird double-edged sword. You have to love to eat, but you can't eat so much that it becomes unhealthy.'\n\nThe first Nathan's hot dog eating contest, held in 1972, was won by Jason Schechter, who ate just 14 wieners.\n\nWhile it is unclear why the amount eaten has changed over the decades, it was likely due to people training for months to expand their stomachs.\n\nA 2007 study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania analyzed a 29-year-old man who ranked among the top 10 worldwide in competitive eating.\n\nThe man was asked to ingest an effervescent agent and high-density barium before eating hot dogs for 12 minutes, which allowed researchers to see the food move through his body.\n\nAnother group of regular eaters consumed seven franks before reporting symptoms of sickness.\n\nFollowing the study, the competitive eater's stomach showed it could expand as he consumed the food.\n\n'The key to success in competitive speed eating is the ability to slowly train and adapt the stomach so that it can expand and dilate to a remarkable degree, enabling the speed eater to consume an extraordinary volume of food in an extremely short time (possibly superimposed on an innately compliant stomach),' according to the published paper.\n\nThe team compared a competitive eater to 'a predatory carnivore that periodically gorges itself on its kills, ingesting massive amounts of food for sustenance until it captures another prey days or even weeks later.'\n\nHowever, these eaters may also lose the sensation of fullness and satisfaction when eating regularly.\n\nThe researchers noted that there is not enough data to predict what will happen to competitive eaters.\n\nThe team wrote in the study that there is a potential risk that the dilated, flaccid stomach may eventually decompensate, becoming an enormous sac incapable of shrinking to its original size and emptying solid food.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

(Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images) Getty Images Alongside the new era of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights, another paradigm shift is underway, ushering in unprecedented brand recognition and wealth for some athletes. On Power 4 college campuses, this evolution is startling as high-profile millionaire athletes can be seen walking through the student union to buy a smoothie. For high-profile college athletes, the trajectory today towards financial prosperity is staggering, often surpassing that of most faculty and staff on campus. This newfound wealth positions them not just as wage earners, but as potential owners and investors in diverse ventures, transcending the traditional training of recently matriculated business students who are looking for their first job. Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor and ubiquitous media figure, recently sparked discourse with a compelling notion in his newsletter, \"No Mercy/No Malice\". Galloway discusses wealth acquisition, distinguishing between earners (who rely on paychecks for survival and sustenance) and owners, whose fortunes stem from investments and asset ownership (and very favorable tax advantages). \u201cIf you get a paycheck, whether it\u2019s salary or freelance, and that\u2019s how you pay your bills, you\u2019re an Earner. Owners, on the other hand, might collect wage income, but their real money comes through profits from investments: stock sales and dividends, rent from property, and other income streams derived from the ownership of assets. To be an Earner is noble; you work for a living, and labor is a sacred thing. Labor is the source of food, shelter, entertainment, and every material pleasure of society,\u201d writes Galloway. While concerns persist about athletes falling prey to binding contracts and empty promises, a new issue should be considered\u2014one that contemplates the potential pathways between \"earnership\" and \"ownership\".

James Wood, a Harvard professor, observes a growing trend among some of today\u2019s students who follow selected paths \u2014 a desire to accumulate wealth early in their careers so as to later champion causes they believe in, a concept termed \"effective altruism\". This aspiration to help others financially resonates deeply with athletes, many of whom hail from backgrounds marked by economic struggles. Their ambitions extend beyond lavish purchases to include familial support (like buying a home for a parent or taking care of a friend who is facing hardship), reflecting a desire to uplift their communities. There are other determining factors in these new found investment opportunities. Earners are also treated differently when it comes to taxes. Wealthy individuals are shielded by favorable tax laws as both passive and active investors, with the incredible ability to push out gains and losses over years. Tax incentives may accelerate an athlete\u2019s thinking on the transition from earner to owner, providing further impetus for athletes to explore investment opportunities. The ability to shield wealth through capital gains and strategic tax planning incentivizes the pursuit of ownership. For athletes like WNBA rookie Angel Reese of the Chicago Sky, the transition from earner to owner has begun. Reese announced her ownership stake in a new women's professional soccer team in Washington, D.C. embodying the shift towards entrepreneurial ownership within sports she has seen others make. This trend is growing; other superstars in the sports world, including Renee Montgomery, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Lisa Leslie and Candace Parker, have blazed similar trails. Their actions signal a broader cultural shift, one where athletes increasingly aspire to wield influence beyond the confines of their playing careers. For rising college superstars JuJu Watkins, Hannah Hidalgo and Paige Bueckers, what might exist for them when they turn pro? Concurrently, there are many sports-adjacent influencers encouraging college athletes to grow their platforms, including Jason Belzer, Jim Cavale and Andrew Petcash. Each has innovated in this space: Belzer with the Student-Athlete NIL Summit, Cavale with Athletes.org, and Petcash with his forward thinking work with GamePlan. As the landscape of college athletics evolves, the dream of becoming both an earner and an owner beckons a new generation. Encouraged by peers and influencers within the sports industry, athletes are increasingly drawn to the prospect of building legacies that extend far beyond where they are today. No longer \u201ckids\u201d as some administrators and coaches still call them; they are changing the world both for their families and the industries they choose to invest in. The question could then become: how can colleges best support their emerging financial aspirations? Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here.

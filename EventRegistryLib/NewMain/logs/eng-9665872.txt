Many people in the tiny town have known them for years. It took only a few hours for collective heartbreak to set in.\n\nLast Thursday, there was a frantic search after Callie was found murdered inside her home. Erin and her six-year-old sister had been kidnapped. Thursday evening, a suspect was in custody. The six-year-old daughter was the only survivor. Her school bus driver was at a loss for words.\n\n\"I just love her, and I don't know how this poor child is going to...you know a lot of prayers for her,\" said Chris Babin.\n\nMixed in with the community's grief is anger. It's directed at Callie and Erin's accused killer, 36-year-old Daniel Callihan.\n\nInvestigators with the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office described Callihan as Callie's \"on again, off again\" boyfriend.\n\n\"He should get the death penalty. that's what I think,\" said Jimmy Brister, a Loranger resident.\n\nCallihan asked for the death penalty himself shortly after being booked in Jackson, Mississippi on multiple charges, including capital murder.\n\nWhen asked by a Fox 8 reporter if he hoped for the death penalty, Callahan replied, \"for what I did? Lethal injection is the easiest thing for me.\"\n\nFox 8 legal analyst Joe Raspanti says Callihan is in no position to request the death penalty.\n\n\"He can not ask for the death penalty. That's against the rules. So, you may have to look to a psychiatrist to evaluate him to see if he is whatever mental state he was in. So, you may have to put in a not guilty by reason of insanity plea. But at the end of the day, it's going to be what the doctor says, and how he was at the time of the act, and then a jury is going to have to decide whether or not to put him to death, no matter what he says,\" said Raspanti\n\nCallihan's accused accomplice, 32-year-old Victoria Cox is facing similar charges. Her alleged role in the abduction and murder in Mississippi is unclear. The investigation involves authorities in two states and the FBI, which is now leading that investigation.\n\nOne detail the agency will try to clarify is the time Callie was killed. According to Brunett's obituary, she died on Wednesday, June 12, the day before her daughters were located. At a news conference, the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff said he believed Callie was killed on that Wednesday.\n\n\"I can't give you any certainty of when it was. We believe it was certainly before [Thursday]. We don't believe it all occurred [Thursday]. We believe it occurred sometime Wednesday,\" said Sheriff Daniel Edwards.\n\nWhat took place has some families feeling less safe about their country community. Darci Heck says for a time, Callihan was next door to where she and her daughter live in Amite.\n\n\"It could've been anybody. It could've been us. It could've been out here. My daughter doesn't like to go outside now. If she hears something outside, she'll run in the house,\" said Heck.\n\n\"It was so scary just knowing that he lived behind us, it's just really scary,\" said Heck's daughter, Laci.\n\nThe state public defender's office in Louisiana has appointed Kerry Cuccia to represent Callihan. Cuccia is the director of the Capital Defense Project of Southeast Louisiana. He declined to comment on the case, saying doing so would be premature.\n\nCallihan is due in Federal court in Mississippi on June 25.\n\nA Tangipahoa Parish Grand Jury will convene at 9 a.m. in Amite on Thursday, June 20.\n\nThe funerals for Callie and Erin Brunett will be held at 1:30 p.m. Thursday afternoon. While Loranger is their hometown, their services will take place in nearby Hammond.", "source": {"uri": "wafb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

consider the case against Daniel Callihan and Victoria Cox after the alleged kidnapping and murders.\n\n36-year-old Callihan and 32-year-old Victoria Cox are both in custody and facing multiple

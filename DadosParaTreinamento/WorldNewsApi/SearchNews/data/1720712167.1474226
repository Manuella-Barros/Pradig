Bush told TMZ Sports he \"absolutely\" thinks the Trojans' title will be reinstated after the former USC running back had his Heisman Trophy reinstated earlier this year. The NCAA stripped USC of its national title in 2011 amid a probe into impermissible benefits given to Bush during his time at the program. Those benefits would be considered permissible under current rules, which allow players to make money off their name, image and likeness. The Heisman Trophy Trust returned Bush's Heisman earlier this year amid the allowance of NIL rules. Bush was one of the most dynamic running backs in college football history, compiling 3,169 rushing yards and 1,301 receiving yards in three seasons with the Trojans. He compiled 1,740 rushing yards and 478 receiving yards in his 2005 Heisman-winning campaign. \"I'm thinking about my time at USC and just how much of the work we put in produced the results that you saw on the football field, including this Heisman Trophy right here,\" Bush said in April. \"You can't get to this\u2014or a national championship\u2014by cheating, I promise you.\" The NCAA has not given any indication that they are considering reinstatement of championships that were vacated by violations of past rules.", "summary": "Reggie Bush believes USC's 2004 national championship is headed back on the record books.

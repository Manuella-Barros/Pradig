Ortiz-related complaints settled by the city cost taxpayers nearly $600,000 combined.\n\nInvestigators talked to witnesses -- including former and current Miami police officers -- who said Ortiz engaged in a \"pattern of abuse and bias against minorities, particularly African-Americans\" and that he cyber-stalked and doxxed \"civilians who question his authority or file complaints against him.\"\n\nThe two-year investigative report produced in 2021 by state and federal law enforcement officials did not lead to criminal charges against Ortiz.

There have been a ton of use-of-force issues and discourtesies.\"\n\nOrtiz joined the Florida state force after graduating from a monthlong boot camp in February with roughly 200 other volunteers, personnel records show. The training, based at Camp Blanding, was the State Guard's second boot camp since being revived by the Florida Legislature at DeSantis' behest in the summer of 2022.\n\nThe Times/Herald confirmed Ortiz's involvement in the State Guard through public records that were released by the DeSantis administration after lawyers for the news outlet intervened.\n\nDeSantis, who wants to build the force to 1,500 members, initially floated bringing back the State Guard -- a World War II-era force decommissioned in 1947 -- to back up a stretched-thin National Guard in times of crisis. Since then, he has sent members to migrant hotspots at the southern border and in the Florida Keys, and worked with lawmakers to create a specialized unit with guns and police-like responsibilities. Members can be paid a stipend based on what they do during a mission and where they travel.\n\nEarlier this year, the State Guard's vetting process came under scrutiny when recruits were detained for criminal and mental health issues.\n\nThe State Guard has since asked the Legislature for the authority to conduct more extensive background checks on recruits, saying volunteers would be interacting with vulnerable populations. Lawmakers agreed, and DeSantis last month signed into law a bill allowing the State Guard to do fingerprint-based checks on a person's state and national criminal and employment records -- a change that would not have affected the onboarding of Ortiz, who has no criminal convictions.\n\nYet Ortiz's history with the Miami Police Department is long and controversial -- and the two-year investigative report details much of it.\n\nIn one instance, the report says Ortiz pulled over a Black school teacher after she picked up her 1-year-old at her mother's home in Liberty City. Ortiz said he stopped her because he saw her buying drugs. When she denied it, he asked her how she could afford her nearly new Dodge Charger and what she did for a living. The woman said the encounter ended with Ortiz arresting her and pressing her face into the pavement.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement report also noted that Francois Alexandre, a college student, accused Ortiz and other police officers of beating him up and breaking his eye socket while he was celebrating the Miami Heat's second straight NBA championship in June 2013.\n\nIn a lawsuit, Ortiz was accused of placing Alexandre in a \"headlock around the neck\" and pushing him against a wall, according to court records. Ortiz prevailed in court, with a federal appeals court judge saying Ortiz had \"qualified immunity\" because he used reasonable force when he took down Alexandre and did not pile up on him or punch him like other officers allegedly did.\n\n\"When somebody like Ortiz has a track record like this, how can anyone stand up and say, 'He works for me,'\" Alexandre told the Herald at the time.\n\nSeveral police chiefs tried to fire Ortiz, but their efforts were rebuffed by strong union protections. Then, in September 2022, Miami Police Chief Manny Morales fired him -- but it only lasted eight months. Ortiz was reinstated in May 2023 under an agreement that severely limited his interactions with the public and guaranteed his retirement by November 2025.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Ortiz earns more than $155,000 a year but he was stripped of a gun and a take-home car.\n\nIn addition to the citizen complaints, Ortiz has drawn headlines for making racial comments.\n\nHe once called 12-year-old Tamir Rice -- who was shot and killed by a Cleveland cop while playing with a toy gun -- a \"thug.\" He flew to Ferguson, Missouri, to take part in a barbecue with police officers after civil unrest exploded there following the killing of Michael Brown, a Black man shot and killed by police. He instigated a social media battle with Beyonce over a video about police brutality and urged other Miami officers to refuse to work security details for her concert.\n\nAnd at a Miami commission meeting, Ortiz once explained to the city's lone Black commissioner that he was not Hispanic, but a Black man because of the \"one-drop rule\" -- an old racist trope that implies anyone with a degree of Black ancestry was Black.

A State Guard roster shows he is part of the general \"Crisis Response Battalion\" that responds to emergencies on the ground.\n\nIt is unclear whether he has been deployed yet. Both he and the State Guard ignored repeated questions over several weeks from the Herald/Times.\n\nThe Miami Police Department also declined to comment.\n\nThe controversial Miami cop's association with the State Guard came to light in February, when a police report listed him as one of two guards who reported that another recruit had allegedly threatened to \"blow up\" Camp Blanding, the North Florida military base where they were training.\n\nSome who are familiar with Ortiz's history in Miami are now questioning the judgment of State Guard leaders after learning Ortiz had joined the organization's ranks.\n\n\"I can't wrap my mind around how concerning this is,\" Rodney Jacobs, the director of Miami's civilian police review panel, said after learning Ortiz became a State Guard member this year. \"Are they being vetted?\"\n\nJacobs, a Democrat running to represent District 35 in the Florida Senate, is familiar with Ortiz's history with the Miami Police Department, which was problematic enough to draw the attention of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI.\n\nA few years ago, the two agencies looked into nearly 70 complaints, including 44 citizen complaints and 18 allegations of excessive use of force. Ortiz-related complaints settled by the city cost taxpayers nearly $600,000 combined.\n\nInvestigators talked to witnesses -- including former and current Miami police officers -- who said Ortiz engaged in a \"pattern of abuse and bias against minorities, particularly African-Americans\" and that he cyber-stalked and doxxed \"civilians who question his authority or file complaints against him.\"\n\nThe two-year investigative report produced in 2021 by state and federal law enforcement officials did not lead to criminal charges against Ortiz. Though the report found many allegations of wrongdoing, investigators concluded \"there was not enough physical evidence and not enough information within the five-year statute of limitations to pursue any criminal charges.\"\n\n\"His judgment while here was questionable,\" Jacobs said. \"I can't remember how many complaints he's had since he's been here. There have been a ton of use-of-force issues and discourtesies.\"\n\nOrtiz joined the state force after graduating from a month-long boot camp in February with roughly 200 other volunteers, personnel records show. The training, based at Camp Blanding, was the State Guard's second boot camp since being revived by the Legislature at DeSantis' behest in the summer of 2022.\n\nThe Herald/Times confirmed Ortiz's involvement in the State Guard through public records that were released by the DeSantis administration after lawyers for the news outlet intervened.\n\nDeSantis, who wants to build the force to 1,500 members, initially floated bringing back the State Guard -- a World War II-era force decommissioned in 1947 -- to back-up a stretched-thin National Guard in times of crisis.\n\nSince then, he has sent members to migrant hotspots at the southern border and in the Florida Keys, and worked with lawmakers to create a specialized unit with guns and police-like responsibilities.

The answer seems obvious", "body": "Miami's notorious bad-boy cop Javier Ortiz -- known for using racially-charged language and accused almost 20 times by citizens of using excessive force -- could be deployed to aid Floridians in their most distressed moments as a member of the Florida State Guard.\n\nOrtiz -- who, as the Herald reported this week, joined the Guard in February -- won't just be handing out water bottles after hurricanes. The State Guard, revived by Gov. Ron DeSantis reportedly to help respond to natural disasters, has morphed into a force that could serve as the governor's own militia. It's possible Ortiz could be sent to the southern border and the Florida coast to stop migrants DeSantis likes to vilify. It's unclear if Ortiz has been deployed yet, according to the Herald.\n\nOrtiz might fit right in. No one embodies the bravado and chest thumping the governor seems to encourage in the state's force like the Miami police captain.\n\nOrtiz agreed to give up his work-issued gun and work a desk job in exchange for getting his job back at the Miami Police Department following his firing in 2022. That was one of many times police chiefs tried to terminate Ortiz but ran into union protections.\n\nSince DeSantis first pushed to reinstate the State Guard -- inactive since 1947 -- the Legislature has allowed him to transform the non-military organization into something resembling his personal army. Lawmakers not only expanded the force, but also allowed the governor to deploy it outside of Florida to places like the Texas border -- all of it on taxpayers' dime. A special unit -- of which Ortiz is, thankfully, not a part, according to the Herald -- has received combat training in things such as \"aerial gunnery\" and how to treat \"massive hemorrhages.\"\n\nWith the governor's inflammatory rhetoric about a possible \"invasion\" from Haitian immigrants when he deployed officers to the Florida Keys in March, and his promise to \"start slitting throats\" in the federal bureaucracy during his failed presidential run, it's no wonder someone like Ortiz would apply for the governor's Guard.\n\nOrtiz's career has been marked by 70 complaints filed against him, including 44 citizen complaints and 18 allegations of excessive use of force, according to the Herald. State and federal investigators looked into them years ago. They talked to witnesses who said Ortiz engaged in a \"pattern of abuse and bias against minorities, particularly African-Americans\" and that he cyber-stalked civilians who questioned his authority. The investigation did not lead to criminal charges against Ortiz because, according to a 2021 state and federal report, there was not enough physical evidence to charge him.\n\nOrtiz might not have a criminal background, but it's far from a good idea for the state to allow him to respond to crises when even his own employers at the Police Department recognize he should not interact with citizens.\n\nOrtiz' long record speaks for itself and has been documented in numerous news articles and the state's own investigations -- and a simple Google search could unearth it.\n\nAmong the incidents documented in the 2021 report: He pulled over a Black school teacher, whom Ortiz accused of buying drugs. When she denied it, he asked her how could afford a nearly new Dodge Charger. He arrested her and pressed her face onto the pavement.\n\nOrtiz' history of racially-charged comments include his calling Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy shot and killed by Cleveland police while playing with a toy gun, a \"thug.\" At a Miami commission meeting, he once said he wasn't a white Hispanic man, but Black because of the \"one-drop rule\" -- an old racist trope that implies anyone with a degree of Black ancestry is Black.\n\nCan the state trust Ortiz to be deployed to Black communities in the aftermath of a hurricane, or to intercept Haitian migrants trying to reach Florida's shores? He clearly thinks he belongs in the Florida State Guard -- and why wouldn't he?", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_captain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police captain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Keys"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-drop rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/1i94r7/picture275023546/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_City_Meeting_MJO_19", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547536", "eventUri": "eng-9547536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Ortiz was investigated for cyberbullying and other violations by the department due to that incident.\n\nOrtiz has also been suspended from the police force multiple times before his dismissal last year.\n\nAt the time of Ortiz's initial firing, Miami police chief Manny Morales said to NBC Miami that Ortiz was dismissed because of the amount of infractions on his record.\n\n\"He has, through his entire career, been able intimidate and manipulate the disciplinary process of the Miami police department to avoid any serious consequences for his actions,\" said Morales.\n\nBut, despite the investigation, Ortiz was later rehired last May and allowed to keep his rank, NBC Miami reported.\n\nOrtiz's hiring raises additional concerns as the Florida state guard is reportedly being trained as an armed, combat-ready militia under DeSantis's command versus a disaster relief agency, according to military veteran recruits who have quit the state guard training program.\n\nVolunteers with the state guard are increasingly being trained for combat, according to an investigation by the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times, with some guard members experiencing \"abuse\" from training officers.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gloria_oladipo@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Gloria Oladipo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVJ", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTVJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/708394b2e857634289262bff0778bca7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547536", "eventUri": "eng-9547536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In what role or what part of the game? Doesn't matter. I'm just here to pitch, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity from the staff and the organization, that they let me go out there and compete.\"\n\nOn the year, Ortiz is 2-1 with a 2.89 ERA through 18\u2154 innings of work.\n\nHis walk total (10) has been higher than desired, but opponents are hitting just .154 off of him.\n\nHe's been used twice in extras and has seen action in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth innings.\n\nThe Pirates have also regularly turned to him in high-leverage situations, entrusting him to strand runners on base and protect leads.\n\n\"The biggest thing we've seen with (Ortiz) is when he's good, he stays in that attack mode,\" said manager Derek Shelton. \"He goes right after people. When he struggles is when he scatters the ball. The more confidence he gets in these leverage roles of, 'Hey, just go out and pitch until I'm taken out,' instead of worrying about how many outs he's going to pitch has really helped.\"\n\nEight of Ortiz's 11 appearances to date have been more than an inning.\n\nOrtiz's versatility and readiness to pitch whenever called upon has made him a valuable early piece of the Pirates' bullpen.\n\n\"He's competitive but also, he doesn't take long to get loose,\" said Pirates bullpen coach Justin Meccage. \"That's a unique factor for a reliever, especially in a leverage situation. His ability to bounce back -- he's a freak from a physical perspective. All those things as a reliever are awesome.\"\n\nUntil recently, the 6-foot-2, 235-pound Ortiz utilized four primary pitches, leaning primarily on a sinker and slider, which he throws 75% of the time, per Statcast.\n\nOrtiz also uses a four-seam fastball and more sparingly, a changeup.\n\nOf late, the Pirates have been working with Ortiz on developing a cutter.\n\n\"Never thrown it before,\" Ortiz said. \"First time, but it has been working really good, especially against lefties. It's all about throwing it and gaining that confidence with it. I think we're in a really good spot right now.\"\n\nFalter can relate to the transition Ortiz is having to make this season.\n\nThe 27-year-old, acquired from Philadelphia last August for Rodolfo Castro, bounced between the bullpen and starting rotation during his time with the Phillies.\n\nAfter arriving in Pittsburgh late last summer, seven of his 10 appearances were starts, with three long-relief outings sprinkled in.\n\n\"He's been doing a phenomenal job,\" Falter said of Ortiz. \"It's not easy being a starter and then pitching out of the bullpen. The routine changes a lot. He's been throwing really well and has been doing well with inherited runners as well, too. Just more reps, the better he is going to get. He's doing a great job right now.\"\n\nFalter had reason to be grateful for his teammate recently, as Ortiz relieved him May 5, an eventual 5-3 win by the Pirates over Colorado.\n\nOrtiz took the mound with two men on and one out in the top of the sixth, but promptly extinguished the threat.\n\nWhen the Pirates scored four runs in the bottom half of the frame and held the Rockies scoreless for the remainder of the way, Ortiz became the evening's winning pitcher.\n\n\"I owe him a couple of beers after saving those two runs for me,\" Falter said postgame.\n\nAt the moment, Ortiz is likely to stay put in the bullpen.\n\nWhile he remains an option to slide back into the rotation should the situation arise, Ortiz is content to continue carving out a role as a reliever.\n\n\"He just wants to pitch and he wants to help in any way,\" Meccage said.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_guerriero@triblive.com", "name":

Raul Ortiz was tased, arrested, and charged with multiple felonies on May 11, 2023 -- but his attorney says the officers are the ones who broke the law.\n\n\"I mean, when they came in doing it, it traumatized me,\" said Ortiz.\n\nThe lawsuit filed this week states the officers broke the law by maliciously assaulting Ortiz.\n\n\"I want reprimands, I want officers put in jail,\" said Ortiz. \"I want them to experience what I experienced.\"\n\nThe incident happened when Ortiz's ex-girlfriend -- Brittney Warner -- told officers she needed help getting back into his house to retrieve her belongings. Officer Paige Mitchell's body cam video shows police agreeing to help by driving out to meet with her at Ortiz's home. One officer can be seen knocking at the door, but Ortiz refused to let him in.\n\nMitchell can then be heard suggesting to Warner that she has the right to kick in the door.\n\n\"You've lived here, so if you want to kick the door in and go in and get your stuff, you're more than welcome to,\" said Mitchell.\n\n\"He's got a deadbolt lock,\" Warner replied.\n\n\"Any door can be kicked in depending on how hard you work on it,\" suggested Mitchell.\n\nWarner then kicks the door open - as officers Colty Hersh and Chris Lewis walk in behind her. They walk upstairs following Warner, Hersh draws his gun. Soon after, a scuffle between officers and Ortiz can be heard on Mitchell's body cam. Mitchell then begins walking upstairs to the second-floor landing.\n\nMitchell tases Ortiz, despite the fact he keeps telling officers about his heart condition.\n\n\"I got a heart monitor!\" Ortiz can be heard shouting frantically.\n\nBy the time it was over, Ortiz would be arrested and charged with five felonies.\n\n\"They had no right to even go up there and grab him and arrest him and cuff him,\" said Ortiz's attorney Anthony Nici. When Nici obtained Mitchell's body cam footage he quickly filed a motion to dismiss.\n\n\"We showed up for a pretrial and the prosecutor said we dismiss the charges,\" said Nici.\n\nOrtiz's attorneys have now filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Elyria Police Department and each of the three officers individually. The suit claims the officers' \"actions were intentional, malicious, willful, wanton and oppressive and in deliberate disregard for the rights of the Plaintiff.\"\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to state, the \"EPD has a documented history of failing to train its personnel. Thereby resulting in violations of the Plaintiff's constitutional rights.\"\n\n\"Say to this person, 'Go kick the door in, we can't',\" said Nici scornfully. \"What were you thinking?\"\n\nNici says Warner had no right entering the home to begin with since she had already moved out. Something officers would have known if they had first contacted the homeowner.\n\n\"I mean, when they came in doing it, it traumatized me,\" said Ortiz.\n\nNici says this was also a civil matter and Mitchell had no right telling Warner what to do. Ortiz says he was facing up to 30 years in prison if convicted for the five felonies he was initially charged with.\n\n\"If it wasn't for my attorney knowing the law as good as he is, I would've been stuck,\" said Ortiz.\n\n19 Investigates reviewed the officers' personnel files and found they were not disciplined for this incident. There is no evidence the incident was even investigated. Elyria Police Chief William Pelko declined to comment on this incident other than to say the body cam videos from the other two officers were not saved due to an oversight.\n\n19 Investigates contacted Mayor Kevin Brubaker and each member of his administration.

Latinx students make up nearly 6% of the campus population, and 32% of college students are first-generation, the first to earn a degree in their families.\n\nKarina Ortiz is one of those students, and she's getting ready to walk the graduation stage with her family roots top of mind.\n\n\"My ambition really comes from kind of being the first-generation college student in my family,\" Ortiz said.\n\nOrtiz's family raised her in New Jersey. Her dad is Puerto Rican, and her mom is from Peru. She worried she would lose her cultural roots if she attended a university in Iowa.\n\n\"I was really afraid before I came to UNI . . . that I was losing my Spanish,\" Ortiz said.\n\nHer professor, Elise DuBord, understands this fear.\n\n\"[Students say], 'now that I'm away from my family, I'm not speaking Spanish anymore.' And I think that is a very common experience that as students have more and more access to higher education, sometimes they have less connection with family,\" DuBord said.\n\nOrtiz's journey to earning her education has been nontraditional. She began her studies at DMACC, until a jaw surgery forced her to take time off to pay for her medical bills. Her cousin, Giovanni, encouraged her to go back to college.\n\nOrtiz enrolled at UNI, joining Elise DuBord's Spanish Heritage class to sharpen her Spanish.\n\n\"When I first started in that class, I think I was very shy,\" Ortiz said. \"And I didn't know what I was going to do here.\"\n\nStill, she dived into her studies, majoring in English and minoring in Creative Writing and Spanish/English translation.\n\nHer experience of being raised bilingual isn't uncommon in Iowa. That's why DuBord is working to create more support on campus for students who speak another language at home, as well as first-generation students.\n\n\"One of the hardest things about being a first-generation generation college student, especially someone who grew up speaking a different language, is to find other people who have similar life backgrounds, so that you can identify with those students as well,\" DuBord said.\n\nWith the support of professors like DuBord, Ortiz has excelled in college. Her bilingualism and writing skills have created opportunities not just for her, but for her team and campus culture.\n\nFor the past year, Ortiz has served as the Spanish editor of The Northern Iowan student newspaper, leading a team of translators that produce a news article in Spanish every week.\n\n\"Some of these initiatives, like The Northern Iowan in Espa\u00f1ol, the Spanish column in the newspaper, it gives Spanish a real sort of elevated status and says this is this is something that deserves to be public, and recognized,\" DuBord said of Ortiz's work.\n\nIn addition, Ortiz has published a book of poetry, \"Bilingual Baby: Confessions of a Latina Woman\".\n\nAs Ortiz graduates, she's learned the value of collaborating with others and the value of being bilingual. UNI is a place where she has blossomed with a deeper self-awareness.\n\n\"No matter where you are in life, you can go anywhere that you want to, like you can achieve your dreams, your goals, no matter where you're from,\" she said.\n\nOrtiz will officially graduate from UNI on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 - weareiowa.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Northern_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Northern Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latinx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Falls,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Falls, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Falls, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines_Area_Community_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines Area Community College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multilingualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Iowan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Northern Iowan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WOI/images/b8c39b28-f281-49b6-b226-5c4cd37c7e94/20240509T193128/b8c39b28-f281-49b6-b226-5c4cd37c7e94_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547536", "eventUri": "eng-9547536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The nonprofit has operated quietly for 53 years -- without the attention it deserves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot having a safe place to leave their children is a big reason many mothers don't seek help for substance use disorder. They try to gut it out long after they are no longer emotionally present. When addiction engulfs them, often their children go into the foster care system.\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe women who come here are often broken, hopeless and lacking any financial means. Repeatedly, these women are told they are bad moms, they are weak and they aren't going to make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's wrong. These mothers are strong and Nexus helps them grow stronger. The moms practice sobriety while learning parenting skills. The children receive critical developmental help and start to trust again.\n\nHeather Ormand, Nexus' president and CEO, knows how difficult getting sober is. She took her last drink more than 13 years ago. \"I was such a wreck,\" she recalled. \"I couldn't take care of myself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet she still had a job. She had an apartment and a car. She had the resources to get help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is not the case for the women who come to Nexus. While Ormand has felt the same shame and worthlessness, \"what I came into this journey with is so much different than what they are coming into it with. \"\n\nMayra Ortiz, 31, and her 5-month-old baby, Anthony, are a beautiful example of the women who transform their lives with the help of Nexus. The 12 years or so before the Arlington woman found this place of healing were mostly dark and ugly -- and no different than the journeys that bring most mothers here.\n\nOrtiz, who grew up in a good home, experimented with pot as a teen. After graduating from Mansfield Summit High School, she got into a relationship that became abusive and turned to smoking meth as a way to cope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter four years, she called her mom at 3 a.m. and asked for help to escape both her methamphetamine habit and the man who beat her up. Ortiz stayed off drugs for almost two years -- until she visited an old friend who busted out a bowl of meth.\n\nShe was immediately back in the game.\n\nThe next seven years were a nightmare of drugs, lies and law-breaking. Ortiz gave birth to two children whom she relinquished to family members. She discovered fentanyl, disguised as Percocet, and many days she took dozens of the little blue pills. She sold the \"percs\" to support her habit.\n\n\"I derailed completely,\" she told me. \"I had no need or want to do anything but the drug.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSober from alcohol for more than 19 years, I remember the soul-crushing grip Ortiz described. I also understand why she can't find the words to adequately explain what changed late last year. That's why so many of us choose to describe it as a miracle.\n\nOrtiz's life-transforming moment came while she was pregnant with her third child. Her baby's father, in jail on drug charges, knew Ortiz was desperate and still using. He reached out to a friend who persuaded her to accept help.\n\nAnthony was born in December, and Ortiz was introduced to Nexus the next month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNexus offers a 30-day option for adult women and a 90-day stay for pregnant women and women with children. With Child Protective Services monitoring Ortiz's situation, a family member kept Anthony while she did the 30-day program. CPS allowed Ortiz and Anthony to do the longer stint together.\n\nChildren up to age 12 may live with their mothers in the recovery center dorms. They attend the Nexus Child Development Center and receive health services while their moms participate in intensive counseling sessions and parenting classes. Evenings are devoted to games and family activities before each mom has private time with her children.\n\nBrook Mathis, Ortiz's residential counselor, described her as motivated and ready.\n\n\"No matter what she was facing -- and we had some tough sessions -- she always walked out with a positive perspective, more determined and more motivated.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrtiz credited Mathis as the driving force behind her progress. \"She's the one who got me to act right,\" Ortiz laughed as Mathis gave her a big hello hug.\n\nShe graduated from the 90-day program last month and, with Nexus' help, is now in a three-month transitional stay at Arlington Life. Nexus' myriad wraparound services help moms and their kids with immunizations, document retrieval, driving tests, CPS issues, housing and jobs -- every detail to prepare them to be successful in their next chapter.\n\nAt least three times a week, Ortiz participates in Nexus' intensive outpatient classes. She's also job hunting and waiting for an apartment to come open through the Arlington Life program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ortiz, Anthony and I walked around the Nexus campus, mother and baby repeatedly lit up with huge smiles as their eyes locked on to one another. Anthony, with dark brown eyes and thick black hair, responded to Ortiz's frequent laughter with a delighted shimmy. Throughout the hour, he was unfazed by occasional shrieks in his childcare room or cameras aimed in his direction.\n\nStaff and clients clamored to talk to Ortiz and hold Anthony, who was willing but always happy to get back in his mom's arms. When a staff member joked about it being time for Anthony's first haircut, Ortiz shouted, \"No, no cutting his hair. I love it.\"\n\nFor our first interview, Ortiz had dressed casually, her T-shirt emblazoned with \"Think Happy Thoughts.\" On the second visit, as Ortiz proudly introduced me to Anthony, she wanted both of them to look their best.\n\nThen came this anecdote known to moms everywhere: \"I had him in such a cute outfit and then he 'blew out' his diaper in the classroom,\" she said. \"Now I worry people won't think I know how to properly dress my son.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mayra's been one of our best moms,\" said Natalie Sullivan, director of the Nexus Child Development Center. \"She made it clear from day one that she was here to handle business for the sake of her child and to create better lives for both of them.\"\n\nOrtiz has resumed contact with her 5-year-old son, who lives with her mother, and hopes to get to know her 2-year-old daughter as well. Shame and guilt creep in often, especially when it comes to her first two kids, she said.\n\nThanks to Nexus, she has coping tools. \"If only I had known Nexus existed back then, I promise you I would not have gone so long on drugs,\" she said. \"I love Nexus. I really plan on working here one day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than half of the operation's 170-person staff is in recovery from alcohol or drug use. The campus serves more than 2,000 women and 200 children annually. The mother's program at the facility, built in the 1950s as a men's college, has space for 30 women and at least that many children.\n\nAfter years of fundraising, the recovery center will break ground this month on the first of a five-phase rebuild and expansion of its 11-acre property. Ormand hopes to open the new admissions and medical detox building early next year.\n\nNexus receives 68% of its annual budget from public dollars, most of it from a federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, block grant administered by the state. The remaining 32% comes from North Texas individuals and family foundations.\n\nThe state allows Nexus to house the kids of its clients, but it reimburses only for costs associated with the adults. Private contributions cover the children's services, including childcare, health assessments and speech and occupational therapy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrmand noted about two-thirds of foster care removals in Texas are related to an adult's substance use disorder. \"If that family can stay here intact, rather than get into the foster care system, that's best for everyone,\" she said.\n\nInstead of moms continuing to have kids without adequate resources or skills, Ormand said, at Nexus they can learn to care for themselves and the children they already have so they are a more successful family.\n\nOn Mother's Day, Ortiz will take Anthony to see her mom and other special mother figures who have been part of her recovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe'll also save a copy of the Sunday newspaper until Anthony is old enough to understand their story's significance. \"I want to be able to look back at those photos with him and say, 'Look what we did together.'\"\n\n\"That's a thousand percent what they are doing,\" Ormand said. \"They are doing it together.\"", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He remained free during multiple retrial delays, some due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he was taken back into custody following the unanimous Jan. 27 verdict and had been awaiting sentencing at the New Orleans jail.\n\nWhile waiting for court to open, about two dozen of Hayes' family and friends formed a circle and prayed in the wide courthouse hallway.\n\nSmith's daughter Lisa, now a teenager, was among those who spoke in court before the sentencing. She said her mother had to relearn to walk after the shooting and she lamented not having her father around for major life events.\n\n\"Mr. Hayes, you ruined my life,\" she said. \"You took my father away from me.\"\n\nIn testimony in support of Hayes, his mother, Dawn Mumphrey, expressed sorrow for the loss of Smith. \"Our lives are forever changed as well,\" she said, her voice shaking. She tearfully looked at the judge. \"I ask for your mercy,\" she said.\n\nSmith was shot eight times -- seven times in the back -- during a confrontation with Hayes that happened after Hayes' SUV struck the rear of Smith's vehicle.\n\nHayes has long said he fired in self-defense.

He insisted on the stand that he heard a \"pop\" before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith's wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs.\n\nEvidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. But there was no witness or forensic evidence to back up Hayes' claim that Smith had wielded or fired a weapon. At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn't fire in self-defense.\n\nThe overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith. Hayes was acquitted of that charge at January's second trial.\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005.

Hayes received a 25-year prison sentence today in a New Orleans courtroom.\n\nNEW ORLEANS >> The man who fatally shot retired NFL star Will Smith during a confrontation following a car crash in 2016 received a 25-year prison sentence today in a New Orleans courtroom.\n\nIt was the second time Cardell Hayes, 36, had faced sentencing in Smith's death. He was convicted of manslaughter in December 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts. After a new trial, Hayes was convicted by a unanimous jury in January.\n\nIn handing down the sentence, Judge Camille Buras acknowledged the strong support Hayes received from friends and family. But she noted that both Hayes and a companion were armed when they exited Hayes' car after the crash, and that Smith was unarmed.\n\nSmith was shot eight times -- seven times in the back -- during the confrontation with Hayes that happened after Hayes' SUV struck the rear of Smith's vehicle.\n\nSmith's daughter Lisa, now a teenager, was among those who spoke in court before the sentencing. She said her mother had to relearn to walk after the shooting and she lamented not having her father around for major life events.\n\n\"Mr. Hayes, you ruined my life,\" she said. \"You took my father away from me.\"\n\nIn testimony in support of Hayes, his mother, Dawn Mumphrey, expressed sorrow for the loss of Smith. \"Our lives are forever changed as well,\" she said, her voice shaking. She tearfully looked at the judge. \"I ask for your mercy,\" she said.\n\nHayes has long said he fired in self-defense. He said he fired only because he believed a drunken and belligerent Smith had retrieved a gun from his SUV. He insisted on the stand that he heard a \"pop\" before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith's wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs.\n\nEvidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. But there was no witness or forensic evidence to back up Hayes' claim that Smith had wielded or fired a weapon. At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn't fire in self-defense.\n\nHayes was released on bond after having served more than four years of the original sentence. He remained free during multiple retrial delays, some due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he was taken back into custody following the unanimous Jan. 27 verdict and had been awaiting sentencing at the New Orleans jail.\n\nThe overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith. Hayes was acquitted of that charge at January's second trial.\n\nBefore today's sentencing, about two dozen of Hayes' family and friends formed a circle and prayed in the wide courthouse hallway.\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. He helped carry the team to a winning season in 2006 and a Super Bowl victory in 2010.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)NEW ORLEANS (AP) - The man who fatally shot retired NFL star Will Smith during a confrontation following a car crash in 2016 received a 25-year prison sentence Thursday in a New Orleans courtroom. It was the second time Cardell Hayes, 36, had faced sentencing in Smith's death. He was convicted of manslaughter in December 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts. Hayes was released on bond after having served more than four years of the original sentence. He remained free during multiple retrial delays, some due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he was taken back into custody following the unanimous Jan. 27 verdict and had been awaiting sentencing at the New Orleans jail. While waiting for court to open, about two dozen of Hayes' family and friends formed a circle and prayed in the wide courthouse hallway. Smith's daughter Lisa, now a teenager, was among those who spoke in court before the sentencing. She said her mother had to relearn to walk after the shooting and she lamented not having her father around for major life events. \"Mr. Hayes, you ruined my life,\"\u009d she said. \"You took my father away from me.\"\u009d In testimony in support of Hayes, his mother, Dawn Mumphrey, expressed sorrow for the loss of Smith. \"Our lives are forever changed as well,\"\u009d she said, her voice shaking. She tearfully looked at the judge. \"I ask for your mercy,\"\u009d she said. Smith was shot eight times - seven times in the back - during a confrontation with Hayes that happened after Hayes' SUV struck the rear of Smith's vehicle. Hayes has long said he fired in self-defense. He said he fired only because he believed a drunken and belligerent Smith had retrieved a gun from his SUV. He insisted on the stand that he heard a \"pop\"\u009d before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith's wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs. Evidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. But there was no witness or forensic evidence to back up Hayes' claim that Smith had wielded or fired a weapon. At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn't fire in self-defense. The overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith. Hayes was acquitted of that charge at January's second trial. Smith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005.

He was convicted of manslaughter in December 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts. After a new trial, Hayes was convicted by a unanimous jury in January.\n\nIn handing down the sentence, Judge Camille Buras acknowledged the strong support Hayes received from friends and family. But she noted that both Hayes and a companion were armed when they exited Hayes' car after the crash, and that Smith was unarmed.\n\nSmith was shot eight times -- seven times in the back -- during the confrontation with Hayes that happened after Hayes' SUV struck the rear of Smith's vehicle.\n\nSmith's daughter Lisa, now a teenager, was among those who spoke in court before the sentencing. She said her mother had to relearn to walk after the shooting and she lamented not having her father around for major life events.\n\n\"Mr. Hayes, you ruined my life,\" she said. \"You took my father away from me.\"\n\nIn testimony in support of Hayes, his mother, Dawn Mumphrey, expressed sorrow for the loss of Smith. \"Our lives are forever changed as well,\" she said, her voice shaking. She tearfully looked at the judge. \"I ask for your mercy,\" she said.\n\nHayes has long said he fired in self-defense. He said he fired only because he believed a drunken and belligerent Smith had retrieved a gun from his SUV. He insisted on the stand that he heard a \"pop\" before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith's wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs.\n\nEvidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. But there was no witness or forensic evidence to back up Hayes' claim that Smith had wielded or fired a weapon. At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn't fire in self-defense.\n\nHayes was released on bond after having served more than four years of the original sentence. He remained free during multiple retrial delays, some due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he was taken back into custody following the unanimous Jan. 27 verdict and had been awaiting sentencing at the New Orleans jail.\n\nThe overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith. Hayes was acquitted of that charge at January's second trial.\n\nHayes has already served more than four years in prison, for which he will receive credit. He has also been subject to strict supervision and home confinement. It was not immediately clear whether and how that would count toward his sentence. Buras said she would discuss that with prison officials.\n\nBefore Thursday's sentencing, about two dozen of Hayes' family and friends formed a circle and prayed in the wide courthouse hallway.\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005.

He insisted on the stand that he heard a \"pop\" before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith's wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs.\n\nEvidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation.

At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn't fire in self-defense.\n\nThe overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith.

He was convicted of manslaughter in December 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts.\n\nAfter a new trial, Hayes was convicted by a unanimous jury in January, rejecting defense arguments that Hayes had fired in self-defense, thinking that a drunken and belligerent Smith had retrieved a gun from his SUV.\n\n\"This court has struggled with this case since the time I got it,\" said state District Judge Camille Buras, who presided in both trials. Before sentencing Hayes, she acknowledged the strong support he received from friends and family, and testimony that he had been a model prisoner. But she noted that both Hayes and a companion were armed when they exited Hayes' car after the crash. And she said Smith was unarmed as he retreated to his car \"perhaps to arm himself, perhaps not.\"\n\nSmith was shot eight times -- seven times in the back -- during the confrontation.\n\nBuras also noted the damaging force with which Hayes' Hummer rammed Smith's SUV on the night of the crash. Surveillance video from the night of the shooting showed Smith's Mercedes SUV possibly bumping Hayes' Hummer, then driving off. Hayes followed them. He has said he did not intend to ram Smith's car and the jury acquitted him on a charge related to the ramming at the 2016 trial.\n\nProsecutors had asked for the 25-year sentence, saying Hayes, while he has expressed sorrow, has never acknowledged wrongdoing. Defense lawyer Sarah Chervinsky didn't directly ask for a specific sentence but noted strong community and family support for Hayes and, at one point in her argument, said \"five years is enough.\"\n\nSmith's daughter Lisa, now a teenager, was among those who spoke in court before the sentencing. She said her mother had to relearn to walk after the shooting and she lamented not having her father around for major life events.\n\n\"Mr. Hayes, you ruined my life,\" she said. \"You took my father away from me.\"\n\nIn testimony in support of Hayes, his mother, Dawn Mumphrey, expressed sorrow for the loss of Smith. \"Our lives are forever changed as well,\" she said, her voice shaking. She tearfully looked at the judge. \"I ask for your mercy,\" she said.\n\nHayes has long said he fired in self-defense. During his first trial, he testified that he heard a \"pop\" before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith's wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs.\n\nEvidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. But there was no witness or forensic evidence to back up Hayes' claim that Smith had wielded or fired a weapon. At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn't fire in self-defense.\n\nHayes was released on bond in 2021 after having served more than four years of the original sentence. He was out of prison during multiple retrial delays, some due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he was taken back into custody following the unanimous Jan. 27 verdict and had been awaiting sentencing at the New Orleans jail.\n\nThe overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith. Hayes was acquitted of that charge at January's second trial.\n\nHayes has already served more than four years in prison, for which he will receive credit. He has also been subject to strict supervision and home confinement. It was not immediately clear whether and how that would count toward his sentence. Buras said she would discuss that with prison officials.\n\nBefore Thursday's sentencing, about two dozen of Hayes' family and friends formed a circle and prayed in the wide courthouse hallway.\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. He helped carry the team to a winning season in 2006 and a Super Bowl victory in 2010. Smith attended Ohio State University and helped the Buckeyes win the 2002 national championship.\n\nHayes, who owned a tow truck business, once played semi-pro football and is the father of a teenager and a 2-year-old child.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

Prosecutors in turn argued Hayes' was deserving of a strict sentence, because he had never taken responsibility for his actions.\n\nA jury found 36-year-old Hayes guilty of manslaughter in the April 9, 2016 slaying of Smith, 34. According to prosecutors, the men argued after Hayes' GMC Hummer collided into the back of the Smith's Mercedes-Benz where Sophie Wright Place and Camp Street meet.\n\nHayes shot Smith with eight bullets, including seven in his back.\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Hayes shot Smith's wife, Racquel Smith, in the legs in the same incident. But the jury acquitted Hayes of attempted manslaughter.\n\nFor the manslaughter conviction, Hayes faced a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.\n\nBuras' decision to sentence Hayes to 25 years in prison on Thursday was the second time she handed him prison time in Smith's killing. Eight months after the shooting, a jury split 10-2 convicted Hayes of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, and Buras sentenced Hayes to 25 years in prison.\n\nHayes had served four years of his sentence when he was released to be retried in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that deemed non-unanimous jury verdicts unconstitutional.\n\nHayes will receive credit for time served, Buras said.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jason Williams and assistant district attorneys Matthew Derbes and Constance Tullier prosecuted the case against Hayes, arguing that Hayes fired on the Smiths as their backs were turned in retreat following an altercation. One of Racquel Smith's femurs was shattered by the bullets, they said, while Smith died slumped over the driver's seat of their SUV.\n\nHayes' defense attorneys, John Fuller and Sarah Chervinsky, argued that Hayes fired his gun in fear. Smith had threatened to retrieve a gun from his vehicle, they said, after implying he would use it to hurt Hayes.\n\nSmith's blood alcohol content at the time of his death was almost three times the legal limit for driving in Louisiana, according to his autopsy report, Hayes' attorneys pointed out.\n\nOn Thursday, Chervinsky asked Buras to undo Hayes' conviction, claiming his constitutional rights had been violated in multiple ways, including that defense attorneys had been prevented from presenting evidence about Smith's character that Chervinsky argued would have proved he had violent tendencies; and that a panel of tired jurors had been denied an opportunity to break from their deliberations.\n\nBuras denied each of the defense attorneys' motions, citing an extensive trial record justifying her rulings. Of the jury, Buras said: \"At no point did this court ever sense from the jury they were tired or wanted to go home.\"\n\nSmith's daughter, Lisa Smith, spoke briefly of her father as she delivered a victim's impact statement, saying Hayes had ruined her life and the lives of her two brothers.\n\n\"My dad will never watch me walk across the stage or walk me down the aisle,\" the girl said. \"He will never see any of my achievements, ever.\"\n\nRacquel Smith declined to speak.\n\nMore than 100 people wrote letters and five people spoke on Hayes' behalf, including family members, a pastor and a former deputy warden, saying Hayes' was a loving father to two children and a mentor to youth and other men.\n\nDawn Mumphrey, Hayes' mother, apologized to the Smith family and asked for their forgiveness.\n\n\"I pray for y'all's strength and your success,\" she told the family. \"I ask that y'all pray for us too.\"\n\nThis is a breaking story.

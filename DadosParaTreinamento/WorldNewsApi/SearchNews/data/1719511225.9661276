{"id": 223749938, "title": "Best year yet for Indian filmmakers with three wins at Cannes 2024", "text": "Cannes: It was a triple feat for Indian talent at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival with Payal Kapadia\u2019s \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d, \u201cSunflowers Were the First Ones to Know\u201d by FTII student Chidananda S Naik, and Anasuya Sengupta of \u201cThe Shameless\u201d fame winning major awards in each of the three competitive sections of the prestigious gala. The 77th edition of Cannes, which concluded Saturday, was undoubtedly the best year for the country which found space at the fest through eight Indian, or India-themed, films. Kapadia, an alumna of the Film & Television Institute of India (FTII), charted history by becoming the first Indian filmmaker to win the Grand Prix award for \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d. \u201cThank you, Cannes Film Festival for having our film here. Please don\u2019t wait 30 years to have another Indian film,\u201d she said in her speech. The movie earned the honour, the second-most prestigious prize of the gala after the Palme d\u2019Or, which went to American director Sean Baker for \u201cAnora\u201d. \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d, a Malayalam-Hindi feature starring Kani Kusruti, Divya Prabha and Chhaya Kadam, revolves around three women in Mumbai who go on a road trip to a beach town. Kapadia\u2019s movie, her feature directorial debut, is the first Indian film in 30 years and first ever by an Indian female director to be showcased in main competition, last being Shaji N Karun\u2019s \u201cSwaham\u201d (1994). That \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d will win an award became almost certain when it received glowing reviews following its premiere, with some international critics describing it as a \u201cportrait of urban connection\u201d and \u201cpoetic meditation\u201d as well as comparing Kapadia\u2019s work to that of masters like Satyajit Ray and Wong Kar Wai. Though the second most prestigious prize at Cannes, Grand Prix has a storied history with prominent titles including this year\u2019s Oscar winner \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d and Park Chan-wook\u2019s revenge drama \u201cOldboy\u201d as part of the list. \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d has already found distributors for its North America release, but it\u2019s unclear when the film will be screened in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India is \u201cproud\u201d of Kapadia for her historic feat. \u201cAn alumnus of FTII, her remarkable talent continues to shine on the global stage, giving a glimpse of the rich creativity in India. This prestigious accolade not only honours her exceptional skills but also inspires a new generation of Indian filmmakers,\u201d he said in a post on X. Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said \u201cBharat\u2019s creative economy\u201d is indeed shining with three films winning awards this year at Cannes. \u201cI am proud to share that this film is also the official co-production of the I&B Ministry and is supported by its Film Incentive Scheme,\u201d said Thakur about \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d. These women have scripted history and inspired the Indian film fraternity, said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi about Kapadia and Sengupta. \u201cIndian stars shining bright at the 77th Cannes Film Festival!\u201d Gandhi said on X. Writer-lyricist Varun Grover said it was an \u201cunbelievable day\u201d for Indian cinema. \u201cDissent, in art and in life, is a tough path to choose. But sometimes it does create magic,\u201d he wrote on X. Kapadia, who led a student protest against the appointment of actor-politician Gajendra Chauhan as FTII chairman, had won the Oeil d\u2019or (Golden Eye) award at Cannes for acclaimed documentary \u201cA Night of Knowing Nothing\u201d which premiered under Director\u2019s Fortnight section in 2021. Her 2017 short film \u201cAfternoon Clouds\u201d opened at Cannes under Cinefondation category, dedicated to supporting the next generation of talented filmmakers. Actor Richa Chadha called Kapadia\u2019s win historic. \u201cWow!! What an incredible achievement for Indian cinema! Take a bow,\u201d said Malayalam star Tovino Thomas. That\u2019s not all. Production designer Sengupta, who starred in a key featuring role in Bulgarian director Konstantin Bojanov\u2019s \u201cThe Shameless\u201d, became the first Indian to win the best actress prize in Un Certain Regard. \u201cThe Shameless\u201d explores a dark world of exploitation and misery in which two sex workers forge a bond. Sengupta dedicated her win \u201cto the queer community and other marginalised communities\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be queer to fight for equality, you don\u2019t have to be colonised to know that colonising is pathetic \u2014 we just need to be decent human beings,\u201d she said. Actor Tillotama Shome shared Sengupta\u2019s speech on Instagram. \u201cShe brought it HOME. Listen to her words. Till the end. The quality of her voice. Ink this in your hearts. For all the dreamers\u2026\u201d British-Indian director Sandhya Suri\u2019s \u201cSantosh\u201d, also part of Un Certain Regard, didn\u2019t win any award but being featured at Cannes is an achievement in itself. Neeraj Ghaywan\u2019s \u201cMasaan\u201d previously won two awards\u2014FIPRESCI, International Jury of Film Critics prize and Promising Future prize in the section. Naik\u2019s \u201cSunflowers Were the First Ones to Know\u2026\u201d, which won the La Cinef first prize (film school fiction or animated films), was another feather in FTII\u2019s cap. Based on a Kannada folktale, the movie follows an old woman who steals a rooster following which the sun stops rising in the village. The third La Cinef prize went to India-born Mansi Maheshwari\u2019s animation film \u201cBunnyhood\u201d. Previously, Indian films to be selected for the Cannes Competition segment include Mrinal Sen\u2019s \u201cKharij\u201d (1983), M S Sathyu\u2019s \u201cGarm Hava\u201d (1974), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \u201cParash Pathar\u201d (1958), Raj Kapoor\u2019s \u201cAwaara\u201d (1953), V Shantaram\u2019s \u201cAmar Bhoopali\u201d (1952) and Chetan Anand\u2019s \u201cNeecha Nagar\u201d (1946). This year, India\u2019s presence at Cannes also saw the restored version of Shyam Benegal\u2019s 1976 crowdfunded film \u201cManthan\u201d in Cannes Classics. Karan Kandhari\u2019s \u201cSister Midnight\u201d appeared in Directors\u2019 Fortnight and Maisam Ali\u2019s \u201cIn Retreat\u201d was picked for ACID Cannes. \u201cMaya: The Birth of a Superhero\u201d, a virtual reality title with an India connect, was also selected. In 2013, Indian cinema sent five films to various sections \u2013 \u201cMonsoon Shootout\u201d (Midnight Screening), \u201cBombay Talkies\u201d (a Special Screening to mark 100 years since Dada Saheb Phalke\u2019s \u201cRaja Harishchandra\u201d), \u201cUgly\u201d (Directors\u2019 Fortnight), \u201cThe Lunchbox\u201d (Critics\u2019 Week) and \u201cCharulata\u201d (Cannes Classics).

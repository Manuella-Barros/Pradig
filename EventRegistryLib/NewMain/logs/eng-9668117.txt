Another man, 36-year-old Jeffrey Spyrka, was taken to University of Chicago Medical Center in critical condition.\n\nO'Donnell's family will file a wrongful death lawsuit against contractor Turner Construction and subcontractor Adjustable Concrete Construction, while Spyrka and his wife are suing the companies in Cook County Court for negligence and loss of consortium, attorney Louis Cairo confirmed to Block Club Chicago.\n\nThe Spyrkas' lawsuit, filed June 10, seeks $200,000 in damages plus court costs. The lawsuit on behalf of O'Donnell is pending \"court approval to name an estate administrator to file the complaint,\" Cairo said.\n\nDrone footage of the site and scaffolding \"confirmed that the scaffold was constructed in such a manner that it had several deficiencies contributing to this catastrophic event,\" Cairo said in a statement.\n\nThe scaffold system was supposed to be built so that it \"would not separate from the exterior sides of the building,\" and so that \"the sides of the scaffolding, where they met to create a corner, would not inadvertently separate from each other,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nSpyrka fell over 80 feet \"when an area of the scaffold, specifically the location where the west and south sections met to create a corner of the scaffolding, separated,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nAttorneys allege Turner Construction \"carelessly and improperly gave assurances to the crew on the scaffolding that it was safe to work from the scaffold,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit also accuses Turner and Adjustable Concrete of failing to warn the workers on the site \"of the risk of severe winds that were imminent\" the day of the accident and failing to provide adequate fall protection, among other claims.\n\nThe companies \"are aware of the recent filings and continue to be deeply saddened to learn of this accident,\" Adjustable Concrete president Eric Lindquist said in a statement. Both companies support a full Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation, Lindquist said.\n\n\"We offer our sincerest condolences to the loved ones of those affected,\" Lindquist said. \"We are deeply grateful for the University of Chicago Medical Center doctors and all first responders involved.\"\n\nTurner Construction spokesperson Christopher McFadden said the company is aware of the cases and will \"continue to fully support investigations underway by all relevant agencies and entities.\"\n\nThe next court date on the Spyrkas' case is Aug. 14.\n\nThe June 6 accident was at least the second at the site since the project's groundbreaking in September. Two other workers were injured in a December incident, according to CBS 2.\n\nThe $815 million cancer center will be the first freestanding cancer center in the state upon its completion, officials have said.\n\nThe 575,000-square-foot, seven-story facility will include 80 inpatient beds, 90 exam rooms, a breast cancer center, radiation oncology services and more. The center will consolidate treatment now taking place in five buildings on UChicago Medicine's Hyde Park campus.\n\nBlock Club Chicago is celebrating six years of neighborhood news.

They only had on yellow, fluorescent vests. CBS 2 cameras spotted the scaffolding swaying in the wind after the accident. Crews were seen trying to secure the scaffolding again after O'Donnell and Spyrka fell.\n\nThe lawsuit from O'Donnell's family claims the scaffold was \"incredibly deficient\" and that contractor Turner Construction and subcontractor Adjustable Concrete Construction didn't take proper safety precautions.\n\nThe O'Donnell family's attorneys said the scaffold should have been designed to withstand winds of up to 80 mph, but failed when it was hit with a 44 mph wind gust. They said the scaffold was not properly connected to the building under construction, and that a 3-foot gap at the corner was bridged only with a 4-foot piece of plywood connected with three nails.\n\n\"The point of failure was exactly at that bridge when the scaffolds violently shook, pulled apart at that corner, and the bridge, on which Jeff Spyrka as standing and David O'Donnell was inches away, simply disappeared and fell to the ground,\" attorney Louis A. Cairo said in an email.\n\nSpyrka filed a negligence lawsuit against Turner and Adjustable Concrete last week, making many of the same claims.\n\nConstruction safety expert Frank Burg, a former U.S. Occupation Safety and Health Administration employee, said when suspended from scaffolding, workers are required to wear a tethered safety harness.\n\n\"So no matter what happens to that scaffold -- if it falls, or blows around in the wind, or whatever happens -- the worker is still going to be safe, at least safe in a harness,\" said Burg.\n\nOSHA said it will investigate the accident.\n\nOSHA standards state, \"Work on or from scaffolds is prohibited during storms or high winds unless a competent person has determined that it is safe for employees to be on the scaffold and those employees are protected by a personal fall arrest system.\"\n\nThe agency also says workers who are 6 feet or more above lower levels \"are at risk for serious injury or death if they should fall.\" It also says employers must provide fall protection and proper equipment for the job.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's the second lawsuit in relation to the fatal fall.\n\nThe two workers fell about nine stories to the ground on June 6 during high winds. David O'Donnell, 27, died from the fall, while Jeffrey Spyrka, 36, suffered injuries his attorneys called \"catastrophic and serious.\" Spyrka's family also sued the construction companies.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, alleges that the general contractor, Turner Construction Co., and a subcontractor in charge of erecting the scaffolding system, Adjusted Concrete Construction, didn't take proper safety measures and put workers in danger through a series of \"negligent and careless acts.\"\n\nThe scaffolding was constructed in a way that was \"incredibly deficient,\" according to a news release from GWC Injury Lawyers, a firm representing both Spyrka and O'Donnell. Attorney Louis Cairo said at a news conference that the scaffolding was designed to withstand winds of 80 mph, but that improper construction caused the southwest corner to separate when gusts hit 44 mph.\n\nBefore the fall, he said workers repeatedly complained that the scaffolding wasn't laid out properly, meaning it wasn't snug against the building as it should. Cairo said the southwest corner was held together with a piece of plywood with nails on top. The wind gusts caused the plywood bridge -- where Spyrka and O'Donnell were standing -- to come apart, he said.\n\n\"It's great if you're building a tree fort in the backyard ... it's not how you fix a scaffold that weighs hundreds of thousands of pounds,\" he said.\n\n\"It's improper, it's unsafe, it's unacceptable,\" he continued. \"There is no excuse in the world other than people taking shortcuts, and not bringing up the necessary tools and equipment and items that are necessary to make the scaffold safe.\"\n\nCairo said neither O'Donnell, a technical engineer, or Spyrka, an ironworker, had any obligation to inspect the scaffolding, and they weren't involved in its construction.\n\nA representative for Turner Construction said they are aware of the filing and will \"continue to fully support investigations underway by all relevant agencies and entities.\" Eric Lindquist, president of Adjustable Concrete, said in a statement that the company is aware of the filing and \"deeply saddened to learn of this accident.\" He said they're partnering with Turner Construction to \"support a full investigation into this matter.\"\n\nO'Donnell, who was raised in Oak Forest, is survived by his parents and three brothers. One of his brothers described him as \"wicked smart\" and \"immensely funny,\" saying he enjoyed golf, camping, the White Sox and the Chicago skyline.\n\nO'Donnell's family was very close-knit, Cairo said. O'Donnell had worked with his father since he got out of college and was being trained to take over the family business.\n\n\"One of David's heroes is his father, and he wanted to be like his father. They worked side by side as friends, as colleagues, as coworkers,\" Cairo said. \"He worked with his hero every day, and that's something that's eating them up inside.\"\n\nSpyrka, who has three children under 6 years old, has a long recovery ahead, his attorneys said. He suffered \"devastating internal injuries,\" including a shattered pelvis and crush injuries on his legs, feet and ankles, said attorney Louis Anthony Cairo. He also sustained head injuries.\n\n\"He has an incredible road ahead of him, but fortunately Jeff is extremely strong as we all know since he's still alive and he's still with us and he's fighting every day,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_johnson@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Rebecca Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scaffolding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Construction", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Court_of_Cook_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit Court of Cook County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcontractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subcontractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_contractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General contractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(fastener)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nail (fastener)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skyline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pelvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Education and Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CTC-L-construction-worker-follow08_194934328.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668117", "eventUri": "eng-9668117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 370, "textEnd": 376}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

All comments will be kept anonymous.\n\nThe families of two Chicago construction workers have filed lawsuits against two building firms following the death of one 27-year-old construction worker and critical injuries suffered by another 36-year-old worker.\n\nBoth workers fell nine stories from their scaffolding at a construction site at the University of Chicago Medical Center campus nearly two weeks ago amid high winds.\n\nThe worker who died has been identified as David O'Donnell, a technical engineer. An obituary for him reads, \"David was born and raised in Oak Forest, along with his four brothers. ... He was known for his bright smile and infectious laughter, as well as being the person you could count on having your back in tough circumstances. David excelled at everything he put his mind and incredible work ethic to.\n\n\"After graduating, he followed up on a lifelong promise to his father, and joined him as a technical engineer. They would go on together, along with his Uncle Eamon, to help build some of the tallest skyscrapers you will see in Chicago. It was during this time that David earned the love and respect of the union brothers of the Local 1 Ironworkers, by virtue of his endearing personality and industrious nature.\"\n\nDavid's brother, Patrick, told the press the family was grief-stricken. \"We're missing one of our own,\" he told the press. \"We just can't believe he's gone.\"\n\nThe critically injured worker, Jeffrey Spyrka, is recovering but suffering \"life-altering, catastrophic injuries,\" according to his lawyers from the GWC Injury Partner law firm. A GoFundMe has been set up to help Spyrka and his family, which includes his wife and three young children.\n\nAccording to Larry Langford, director of media affairs for the Chicago Fire Department, \"The accident occurred when the wind caused scaffolding to blow away from the building. They [the workers] appeared not to be tethered.\" Langford said winds were over 55 miles per hour at Midway Airport around the noontime accident. The National Weather Service reported wind gusts of 35 to 40 mph throughout the day across the Chicago region.\n\nThe construction workers were doing work on the outside of an elevator shaft on the eighth floor of the University of Chicago construction site. They both fell over 100 feet into the ground pit that was supposed to be the basement of the building.\n\nThe federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched investigations into multiple companies. These companies include the general contractor, Turner Construction; the employer of O'Donnell, High-Tech State-Out Inc.; the employer of Spyrka, New Horizon Steel of Chicago; and the company responsible for the scaffolding, Adjustable Concrete Construction.\n\n\"An absolutely callous act of negligence\"\n\nSpyrka's family and attorneys are seeking over $200,000 in damages and additional costs, while the O'Donnell family's lawsuit filing is currently pending court approval for an estate administrator.\n\nAttorneys representing both families said the workers were accessing the scaffold when high winds caused a corner to separate. One section of the scaffold then \"swung violently from the wall\" and plunged the workers to the ground, according to the lawyers.\n\nA statement by the law firm notes:\n\nThe suit alleges that the general contractor failed to take appropriate safety measures to ensure that the massive scaffold system that surrounded all sides of the core of a new building under construction was safely and properly erected, as well as the fact that Turner caused and permitted scaffold work to continue at high levels on the exterior of the building's core when the presence of high winds were known to the contractor, but completely ignored, thus compromising the health and safety of the lives of those men that were working on the scaffolding.\n\nThe second Defendant, Adjustable Forms, Inc., is a major concrete contractor that has also been involved in hundreds of concrete building projects in Illinois. Adjustable Forms constructed a massive concrete form pouring system with a trailing scaffold that was 20 feet below the form pouring section that is used by the involved workers to perform their work from.\n\nThe suit alleges that Adjustable Forms failed to properly build the scaffold so that the corners of the structure could not separate, resulting in movement of the scaffold under any conditions, including in high wind conditions.\n\nAccording to OSHA safety standards, wind speeds over 40 miles per hour are considered \"high winds\" and therefore unsafe. Such conditions become a danger to workers when they can get blown from a high place, when winds cause workers to lose control of equipment material or when wind speeds expose workers to other dangerous hazards.\n\nBut according to Louis Cairo, one of the attorneys at GWC, the winds alone were not the primary issue as much as the poor construction of the scaffold. He told the press, \"OSHA has a provision that requires a hanging scaffold of this type will withstand up to 70 mile-an-hour winds. This one was even safer than OSHA requires by 10 miles an hour.\"\n\nCairo also added in a statement, \"Neither of these families should have to go through this. These workers should have never been working on what turned out to be an unsafe, dangerous scaffold perched over 100 feet in the air.\n\n\"This was an absolutely callous act of negligence and misconduct by major construction companies who viewed progress on the job as their priority rather than the safety of the workers on the job. The evidence will prove that this was a totally preventable catastrophe.\"\n\n\"This should never, ever happen\"\n\nIn a statement to CBS, Frank Burg, a construction safety expert and former OSHA employee, was blunt in his criticism of the construction companies and the lack of proper safety measures.\n\n\"This should never, ever happen,\" Burg said. He noted that workers who are suspended from a scaffold are required to wear tethered harnesses. He explained, \"So no matter what happens to that scaffold -- if it falls, or blows around in the wind, or whatever happens -- the worker is still going to be safe, at least safe in a harness.\"\n\nThe result of the OSHA investigation will likely be a slap on the wrist and fines that are a mere pittance to the suffering of the workers and their families.\n\nThis has been the case with nearly every workplace fatality in the United States. Thousands of workers die or are injured every day in America's factories and workplaces, and the companies responsible are largely left untouched.\n\nFines of a few thousand dollars do not fundamentally affect companies such as Turner, whose revenue was over $17 billion in 2023 alone. In fact, two other construction workers were injured last year when a piece of equipment fell on them while working for Turner Construction at the very same site at the University of Chicago campus.\n\nRecently, 28-year-old Caterpillar worker, Daulton Simmers, was killed within seconds by molten metal at the Caterpillar foundry near Peoria, Illinois. The foundry has a record of unsafe conditions, and three workers have died in the last few years alone even as Caterpillar neglects to implement any serious safety measures. A $145,000 fine by OSHA for the death of Steven Dierkes, a worker at the same foundry who fell into a vat of molten metal and died of \"thermal annihilation,\" was immediately contested by Caterpillar.\n\nLast week, a young 24-year-old worker was also killed when sheet metal fell on him at DPR Manufacturing in Michigan. A 33-year-old ironworker in Northeast Portland also died last month from \"catastrophic blunt force trauma\" when a forklift rolled onto her.\n\nIn 2022 alone -- the last tally of workplace deaths reported -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics documented 5,486 fatal work injuries in the United States, a 5.7 percent increase from 2021. Almost one in five workplace fatalities took place in the construction industry. Over 240,000 workers die every year from other workplace-caused health issues from exposure to chemicals, according to OSHA.\n\nAmerican factories more and more resemble industrial slaughterhouses as companies seek to make massive profits at the expense of their workers. According to the International Labour Organization, over 2.3 million individuals worldwide lose their lives to work-related accidents or diseases annually, averaging more than 6,000 deaths each day.\n\nThis process has been going on for decades, with the full complicity of the trade union bureaucracies and the capitalist political parties in the United States and internationally.\n\nWe'd like to hear from you.

Spyrka, 36, a member of Local 1, were working on an exterior elevator shaft at the Comprehensive Cancer Center under construction in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood.\n\nSpyrka suffered catastrophic injuries, but survived the accident. Both Spyrka and O'Donnell's family are being represented by personal injury firm GWC Injury Lawyers of Chicago, which names the general contractor, Turner, and the scaffold provider, Adjustable Forms, as responsible for erecting a scaffold that was \"incredibly deficient,\" according to a press release.\n\n\". . . the scaffold system was supposed to be designed and constructed in such a way that the sides of the scaffolding, where they meet to create a corner, would not inadvertently separate from each other in any manner, particularly where they could create a gap or opening in the floor of the scaffold system,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nGWC alleges that the scaffolding separated when subjected to an estimated 44-mph gust of wind. \"The southwest corner that separated causing these catastrophes was not properly connected to be deemed a safe support for workers or material,\" GWC alleges.\n\nThe law firm also alleges that the scaffold did not have beams underneath the flooring, extending from the west scaffold to the south scaffold, which created a significant gap in structural support. It further alleges that a 3-ft gap between the two scaffolds was bridged with a 4-ft piece of plywood connected with three nails into the west scaffold and three into the south scaffold.\n\n\"The point of failure was exactly at that bridge when the scaffolds violently shook, pulled apart at that corner, and the bridge, on which Spyrka was standing and [with] David O'Donnell inches away, simply disappeared and fell to the ground,\" a GWC press release states.\n\nGWC also alleges that the scaffold was not designed or constructed to have an overlapping interlock at the corner, which is created when one scaffold extends and sits on top of the other with a substantial piece of blocking bolted so as to connect both scaffolds together, thus preventing separation. The law firm alleges that the two scaffolds should have been winched/locked together with cabling around the vertical columns above and below the floor deck area as a further means of ensuring that the scaffolds do not separate under any conditions.\n\n\"Instead, they used a piece of plywood and 6 nails as if building a tree fort in one's back yard rather than this massive structure to support multiple men and heavy equipment in reasonably foreseeable high winds,\" the press release states. \"The level of fault here is far beyond being negligent. It was a complete and total disregard for the health and safety of the workers on this scaffold.\"\n\nThe law firm expects to add more parties to the lawsuits once the discovery process is begun and it learns the names of companies and others involved in building the scaffold system.\n\nChris McFadden, a spokesperson for Turner, said \"we are aware of the court filing, and we continue to fully support investigations underway by all relevant agencies and entities.\"", "source": {"uri": "enr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Engineering News-Record (ENR) magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_O'Donnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christine O'Donnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scaffolding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Chicago Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Construction", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_contractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General contractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(fastener)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nail (fastener)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discovery (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deck (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortification"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2024/06/20/University_of_Chicago_Cancer_Center_ENRready.jpg?height=418&t=1718913247&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668117", "eventUri": "eng-9668117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 93}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 316, "textEnd": 323}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

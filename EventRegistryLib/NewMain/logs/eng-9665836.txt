(SSI), just one month after formerly leaving OpenAI, TechCrunch reported.\n\nSutskever, who was OpenAI's longtime chief scientist, founded SSI with former Y Combinator partner Daniel Gross and ex-OpenAI engineer Daniel Levy.\n\nAt OpenAI, Sutskever was intregral to the company's efforts to improve AI safety with the rise of AI systems \"superintelligent\"AI systems, an area he worked on alongside Jan Leake, who co-led OpenAI's Superalignment team. Yet both Sutskever and then Leigh left the company dramatically in May after falling out with leadership at OpenAI over how to approach AI safety. Leike now heads a team at rival AI shop Anthropic.\n\nSutskiver has been shining a light on the thornier aspects of AI safety for a long time now. In a blog post published in 2023, Sutskever, writing with Leike, predicted that AI with intelligence exceeding that of humans could arrive within the decade -- and that when it does, it won't necessarily be benevolent, necessitating research into ways to control and restrict it.\n\nBuilding safe super intelligence (SSI) is the most important technical problem of our time.\n\nWe have started the world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe super intelligence.\n\nIt is called Safe Superintelligence Inc.\n\nSSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI.\n\nWe approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\n\nThis way, we can scale in peace.\n\nOur singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\n\nWe are an American company with offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, where we have deep roots and the ability to recruit top technical talent.\n\nWe are assembling a lean, cracked team of the world's best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on SSI and nothing else.\n\nIf that's you, we offer an opportunity to do your life's work and help solve the most important technical challenge of our age.\n\nNow is the time. Join us.\n\nThe Verge reported: Last year, Sutskever led the push to oust OpenAI Sam Altman. Sutskever left OpenAI in May and hinted at the start of a new project. Shortly after Sutskever's departure, AI researcher Jan Leike announced his resignation from OpenAI, citing safety processes that have \"taken a backseat to shiny products.\" Gretchen Krueger, a policy researcher at OpenAI, also mentioned safety concerns when announcing her departure.\n\nIn my opinion, it sounds like some of the people who were working on OpenAI have decided to create an entirely new company. Whether that decision was done out of frustration, or because they wanted to branch out on their own, it appears they are looking for other people to join them.", "source": {"uri": "geeknewscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Geek News Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AI-Image-by-Steve-Johnson-on-Unsplash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Leike has since joined rival AI company Anthropic.\n\nAs SSI begins its journey to develop safe superintelligence, the company is likely to attract significant interest from investors, given the growing demand for advanced AI systems and the impressive credentials of its founding team.\n\nWhile Sutskever declined to discuss SSI's funding situation or valuation in an interview with Bloomberg, co-founder Daniel Gross stated that raising capital is not expected to be a challenge for the company.", "source": {"uri": "blockonomi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blockonomi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_dale@blockonomi.com", "name": "Oliver Dale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ssi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 203, "textEnd": 210}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Ilya Sutskever has announced his new company called Safe Superintelligence or SSI that promises to tackle the 'most important problem of our time.'\n\nHe is starting this AI company with a sole and unified goal to keep superintelligence safe. \"We've started the world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,\" Sutskever mentioned in his post on X this week.\n\nSutskever decided to leave OpenAI, the company he co-founded with Sam Altman and others earlier this year. He has even been accused of being the main orchestrator of getting Altman ousted, which is now a history that neither of them would like to talk about as they look at the future.\n\nIn some ways, he takes a dig at his former company which was heading towards building shiny products rather than focus on the safety and ethics of the technology.\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\" It is interesting to see him talk about safety but not without keeping a tight grip on the advancements as well. \"We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead,\" he adds.\n\nSutskever has already got Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy working alongside at the company, which claims is based out of Palo Alto in the US and Tel Aviv in Israel.

In a 2023 blog post co-authored with Jan Leike, co-lead of OpenAI's Superalignment team, the duo predicted that AI with intelligence surpassing humans could emerge within the next decade. In the post they underscored the urgency of researching methods to manage and restrict potentially unfriendly AI.\n\nOpenAI's Superalignment team was focussed on controlling AI systems but was dissolved shortly after Sutskever and Leike left the company.

Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\" a statement posted to the company's website reads. \"We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amid growing concerns in the tech world and beyond that AI may be advancing more quickly than research on using the technology safely and responsibly, as well as a dearth of regulation that has left tech companies largely free to set safety guidelines for themselves.\n\nSutskever is considered one of the early pioneers of the AI revolution. As a student, he worked in a machine learning lab under Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \"Godfather of AI,\" where they created an AI startup that was later acquired by Google. Sutskever then worked on Google's AI research team, before helping to found what would become the maker of ChatGPT.\n\nBut things got complicated for Sutskever at OpenAI when he was involved in an effort to oust CEO Sam Altman last year, which resulted in the dramatic leadership shuffle that saw Altman fired, then rehired and the company's board overhauled, all within about a week.\n\nCNN contributor Kara Swisher previously reported that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \"too far, too fast.\" But days after Altman's ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return, and later said he \"deeply\" regretted his role in the dustup.\n\nLast month, Sutskever said he was leaving his role as chief scientist at OpenAI -- one of a string of departures from the company around the same time -- to work on \"a project that is very personally meaningful to me.\"\n\nIt is not clear how Safe Superintelligence plans to translate a \"safer\" AI model into revenue or how its technology will manifest in the form of products. It's also not clear exactly what the new company thinks of as \"safety\" in the context of highly powerful artificial intelligence technology.\n\nBut the company's launch reflects the belief among some in the tech world that artificial intelligence systems that are as smart as humans, if not smarter, are not some far-off science fiction dream but an impending reality that is not so far away.\n\n\"By safe, we mean safe like nuclear safety as opposed to safe as in 'trust and safety,'\" Sutskever told Bloomberg in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nSome employees who recently departed OpenAI had criticized it for prioritizing commercial growth over investing in long-term safety. One of those former employees, Jan Leike, last month raised alarms about OpenAI's decision to dissolve its \"superalignment\" team, which was dedicated to training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. (OpenAI, for its part, said it was spreading superalignment team members throughout the company to better achieve safety objectives.)\n\nThe launch announcement from Safe Superintelligence suggests that the company wants to take a different approach: \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nJoining Sutskever in launching the new company are Daniel Levy, who had worked at OpenAI for the past two years, and Daniel Gross, an investor who previously worked as a partner at the startup accelerator Y Combinator and on machine learning efforts at Apple.

Considering what had happened in November when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired and then promptly rehired following all the outrage, this wasn't a surprise.\n\nSutskever was a cofounder and chief scientist at OpenAI. He was also the man who was supposed to make ChatGPT and other AI products safe for us, and was instrumental in both Altman's firing and the CEO's return. That's what the public was told, at least.\n\nSutskever chose to depart OpenAI at a time when the newest ChatGPT developments were turning lots of heads. I'm talking about the GPT-4o model OpenAI unveiled a day before Google's big I/O 2024 event, which was focused almost entirely on AI.\n\nI said at the time I couldn't wait to see what Sutskever would be working on next, as he teased \"a project that is very personally meaningful to me about which I will share details in due time.\" Fast-forward to mid-June, we now have the name and purpose of said project.\n\nThe new AI company is called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), and we probably won't hear any specifics about its products anytime soon.\n\nSafe Superintelligence has two other cofounders: Former Apple AI lead Daniel Gross, and former OpenAI engineer Daniel Levy. Sutskever announced the new venture on X, where he outlined the purpose of Safe Superintelligence. Here's a part of the announcement:\n\nSSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI.\n\nWe approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\n\nThis way, we can scale in peace.\n\nOur singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\n\nThat sounds great, at least in theory. A company that develops safe superintelligence is the dream we, humanity, didn't know we needed until recently.\n\nWe want superintelligence to be safe. We wouldn't want AI to take over the world and eventually destroy humanity. That's the worry out there, and it's why it was so important that Sutskever was working on ensuring the safety of ChatGPT. It's also why the massive changes at OpenAI's superalignment team were so disturbing.\n\nI can't help but wonder whether or not what Sutskever wants to deliver is possible. In an interview with Bloomberg, Sutskever said that the company won't launch any products anytime soon. \"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then,\" he said.\n\nSutskever didn't reveal the names of his backers or the amount of money he raised for his Safe Superintelligence startup. Those backers will want some sort of return, no matter how aligned they might be with Sutskever's interests. That's harder to do without a commercial product.\n\nSafe superintelligence, the product, should be artificial intelligence that's far beyond what humans can do. The next step in AI should be AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI that can reason as well as humans. But that's not necessarily the path we'll take. We could always reach superintelligence before AGI.\n\nSafe Superintelligence will not be the only player in the industry trying to achieve superintelligence. It's very likely that many other tech giants and startups, including OpenAI, are also pursuing that goal.\n\nAlso, reputation aside, Sutskever doesn't have a monopoly on AI safety. It's not like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple want to develop unsafe AI. But all these companies will be able to test their AI innovations via commercial products, whereas Safe Superintelligence will not launch anything anytime soon.\n\nI'll also say that Sutskever's work on safe AI doesn't guarantee that his AI or another AI won't go rogue. Anyone with the right resources can train AI models. The theoretical risk remains that someone will reach AGI or superintelligence without properly aligning AI with humanity's interests.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_smith@bgr.com", "name": "Chris Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rsz_gettyimages-1258459705.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

In an official post, the startup said it has \"one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.\"\n\n\"We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product. We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team,\" Sutskever said.\n\nSSI is currently led by Sutskever, Daniel Gross, and another former OpenAI researcher, Daniel Levy. The investors behind the startup remain unknown at the time of writing.\n\nHowever, the company noted in the announcement that the entire \"team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve \"a safe superintelligence.\" The remark somewhat comes off as a shade at OpenAI, which was once sued by Elon Musk for putting profit first before humanity and abandoning its original mission.\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nSutskever announced he's leaving OpenAI on May 15 after working for almost a decade at the leading AI company. Before then, he had gone radio silent following a failed attempt to oust the CEO Sam Altman from OpenAI in December last year.\n\nAnother OpenAI executive, Jan Leike, resigned following Sutskever.

Investors in SSI were not disclosed.\n\nThe trio said developing safe superintelligence -- a type of machine intelligence that could supersede human cognitive abilities -- was the company's \"sole focus\". They added it would be unencumbered by revenue demands from investors, such as calling for top talent to join the initiative.\n\nOpenAI had a similar mission to SSI when it was founded in 2015 as a not-for-profit research lab to create superintelligent AI that would benefit humanity. While Altman claims this is still OpenAI's guiding principle, the company has turned into a fast-growing business under his leadership.\n\nSutskever and his co-founders said in a statement that SSI's \"singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures\". The statement added that the company will be headquartered in both Palo Alto and Tel Aviv.\n\nSutskever is considered one of the world's leading AI researchers. He played a large role in OpenAI's early lead in the nascent field of generative AI -- the development of software that can generate multimedia responses to human queries.\n\nThe announcement of his OpenAI offshoot comes after a period of turmoil at the leading AI group centred on clashes over leadership direction and safety.\n\nIn November, OpenAI's directors -- who at the time included Sutskever -- pushed Altman out as chief executive in an abrupt move that shocked investors and staff. Altman returned days later under a new board, without Sutskever.\n\nAfter the failed coup, Sutskever remained at the company for a few months but departed in May. When he resigned he said he was \"excited for what comes next -- a project that is very personally meaningful to me about which I will share details in due time\".\n\nThis is not the first time OpenAI employees have broken off from the ChatGPT maker to make \"safe\" AI systems. In 2021, Dario Amodei, a former head of AI safety at the company, spun off his own start-up, Anthropic, which has raised $4bn from Amazon and hundreds of millions more from venture capitalists, at a valuation of more than $18bn, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nAlthough Sutskever has said publicly that he has confidence in OpenAI's current leadership, Jan Leike, another person who has recently quit and who worked closely with Sutskever, said his differences with the company leadership had \"reached a breaking point\" as \"safety culture and processes have taken a back seat to shiny products\".

The ultimate goal is to create a \"safe superintelligence\" that will not harm humanity and will operate based on values like liberty and democracy.\n\n\"At the most basic level, safe superintelligence should have the property that it will not harm humanity at a large scale,\" he told Bloomberg.\n\nSSI will have headquarters in the United States and Israel and is hiring right now.\n\n\"We offer an opportunity to do your life's work and help solve the most important technical challenge of our age,\" the new company tweeted.\n\nThis development comes after OpenAI decided to disband its super alignment team, responsible for long-term AI safety, following the departure of key members.\n\nSutskever was part of the OpenAI board that initially fired CEO Sam Altman due to safety concerns, only for Altman to be reinstated a few days later with a new board he controlled. After these events, a new safety team under Altman's control was formed with many of the members in charge of developing safety practices either being fired, moved, or forced to resign.\n\nAs an example, Leopold Aschenbrenner, a former OpenAI safety researcher, recently criticized the company's security practices as \"egregiously insufficient.\" He is currently working on an investment firm focused on AGI development, which he co founded alongside Patrick Collison, John Collison, Nat Friedman, and Gross, who also co founded SSI with Sutskever.\n\nBesides Aschenbrenner, Jan Leike, former head of OpenAI's alignment team, also left the company alongside Sutskever and criticized the company for prioritizing profitability over safety. Shortly after his resignation he announced that he would be joining rival firm Anthropic -- which itself was founded by ex-OpenAI researchers worried about the company's poor approach to safe AI development.\n\nAnd Gretchen Krueger, a policy researcher at OpenAI left the company citing the same concerns shared by Leike and Sutskever.\n\nFormer board members further accused Sam Altman of fostering a \"toxic culture\" in the working environment.

Sutskever said on X that the new lab will focus solely on building a safe \"superintelligence\" -- an industry term for a hypothetical system that's smarter than humans.\n\nSutskever is joined at Safe SuperIntelligence Inc. by co-founders Daniel Gross, an investor and engineer who worked on AI at Apple till 2017, and Daniel Levy, another former OpenAI employee. The new American-based firm will have offices in Palo Alto, Calif., and Tel Aviv, according to a description Sutskever shared.\n\nSutskever was one of OpenAI's founding members, and was chief scientist during the company's meteoric rise following the release of ChatGPT. In November, Sutskever took part in the infamous attempt to oust OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, only to later change his mind and support Altman's return. When Sutskever announced his resignation in May, he said he was \"confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial\" under Altman's leadership.\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc. says it will only aim to release one product: the system in its name. This model will insulate the company from commercial pressures, its founders wrote. However, it's currently unclear who will fund the new venture's development or what exactly its business model will eventually be.\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles,\" the announcement reads, perhaps subtly taking aim at OpenAI. In May, another senior OpenAI member, Jan Leike, who co-led a safety team with Sutskever, accused the company of prioritizing \"shiny products\" over safety. Leike's accusations came around the time that six other safety-conscious employees left the company. Altman and OpenAI's President, Greg Brockman, responded to Leike's accusations by acknowledging there was more work to be done, saying \"we take our role here very seriously and carefully weigh feedback on our actions.\"\n\nRead more: A Timeline of All the Recent Accusations Leveled at OpenAI and Sam Altman\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Sutskever elaborated on Safe Superintelligence Inc.'s approach, saying, \"By safe, we mean safe like nuclear safety as opposed to safe as in 'trust and safety'\"; one of OpenAI's core safety principles is to \"be a pioneer in trust and safety.\"\n\nWhile many details about the new company remain to be revealed, its founders have one message for those in the industry who are intrigued: They're hiring.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_booth@time.com", "name": "Harry Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sutskever.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Image Credit: AFP, Reuters\n\nIlya Sutskever, one of the co-founders of OpenAI, has started a new company called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), just one month after officially leaving OpenAI.\n\nSutskever, who was OpenAI's chief scientist, teamed up with former Y Combinator partner Daniel Gross and ex-OpenAI engineer Daniel Levy to establish SSI.\n\nAt OpenAI, Sutskever played a crucial role in the company's efforts to enhance AI safety, especially with the advent of \"superintelligent\" AI systems. He worked closely with Jan Leike, who co-led OpenAI's Superalignment team.\n\nHowever, both Sutskever and Leike left OpenAI in May following a significant disagreement with the company's leadership over how to handle AI safety. Leike has since joined Anthropic, another AI-focused company, where he now leads a team.\n\nSutskever has long been an advocate for addressing the challenging aspects of AI safety. In a 2023 blog post co-written with Leike, he predicted that AI with intelligence surpassing humans could emerge within the next decade. He emphasized that such AI might not necessarily be friendly and stressed the need for research into methods to control and restrict it.\n\nHis commitment to AI safety remains strong. On Wednesday, Sutskever announced the formation of his new company, SSI, via a tweet. Sutskever stated, that SSI is a mission, and is the basis on which his new organisation will work. He further added that the SSI team, its investors, and its business model, all, are aligned to achieve safe superintelligence.\n\nSutskever further added, that they approach safety and capabilities in tandem, and that technical problems should be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nHe added, \"We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace.\" The singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles. Their business model prioritises safety, security, and progress over short-term commercial pressures, he added.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Sutskever discussed the new company in more detail but did not disclose its funding status or valuation.\n\nUnlike OpenAI, which initially launched as a non-profit in 2015 and later restructured to accommodate the immense funding required for its computing power, SSI is being designed as a for-profit entity from the start. Given the current interest in AI and the team's impressive credentials, SSI may soon attract significant capital. Daniel Gross told Bloomberg, \"Out of all the problems we face, raising capital is not going to be one of them.\"\n\nSSI has established offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv and is actively recruiting technical talent.\n\nThe company aims to push the boundaries of AI capabilities while ensuring that safety measures are always a step ahead. With a focus on revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs, SSI is poised to make significant contributions to the field of AI safety.\n\nThe formation of SSI highlights the ongoing debate and concern within the AI community about the potential risks associated with superintelligent AI.\n\nSutskever's new venture aims to address these risks head-on, ensuring that the development of AI technologies is both safe and beneficial for society.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/06/OpenAI-co-founder-Ilya-Sutskever-launches-new-firm-focused-on-developing-a-safe-super-AI-2024-06-0fde25fc14de6bf4390408c2be49b5d6-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\" a statement posted to the company's website reads. \"We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amid growing concerns in the tech world and beyond that AI may be advancing more quickly than research on using the technology safely and responsibly, as well as a dearth of regulation that has left tech companies largely free to set safety guidelines for themselves.\n\nSutskever is considered one of the early pioneers of the AI revolution. As a student, he worked in a machine learning lab under Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \"Godfather of AI,\" where they created an AI startup that was later acquired by Google. Sutskever then worked on Google's AI research team, before helping to found what would become the maker of ChatGPT.\n\nBut things got complicated for Sutskever at OpenAI when he was involved in an effort to oust CEO Sam Altman last year, which resulted in the dramatic leadership shuffle that saw Altman fired, then rehired and the company's board overhauled, all within about a week.\n\nCNN contributor Kara Swisher previously reported that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \"too far, too fast.\" But days after Altman's ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return, and later said he \"deeply\" regretted his role in the dustup.\n\nLast month, Sutskever said he was leaving his role as chief scientist at OpenAI -- one of a string of departures from the company around the same time -- to work on \"a project that is very personally meaningful to me.\"\n\nIt is not clear how Safe Superintelligence plans to translate a \"safer\" AI model into revenue or how its technology will manifest in the form of products. It's also not clear exactly what the new company thinks of as \"safety\" in the context of highly powerful artificial intelligence technology.\n\nBut the company's launch reflects the belief among some in the tech world that artificial intelligence systems that are as smart as humans, if not smarter, are not some far-off science fiction dream but an impending reality that is not so far away.\n\n\"By safe, we mean safe like nuclear safety as opposed to safe as in 'trust and safety,'\" Sutskever told Bloomberg in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nSome employees who recently departed OpenAI had criticized it for prioritizing commercial growth over investing in long-term safety. One of those former employees, Jan Leike, last month raised alarms about OpenAI's decision to dissolve its \"superalignment\" team, which was dedicated to training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. (OpenAI, for its part, said it was spreading superalignment team members throughout the company to better achieve safety objectives.)\n\nThe launch announcement from Safe Superintelligence suggests that the company wants to take a different approach: \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nJoining Sutskever in launching the new company are Daniel Levy, who had worked at OpenAI for the past two years, and Daniel Gross, an investor who previously worked as a partner at the startup accelerator Y Combinator and on machine learning efforts at Apple. The company says it will have offices in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

One month later, he's started his own AI company -- Safe Superintelligence Inc.\n\n\"We have started the world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,\" Sutskever wrote Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter. \"We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.\"\n\nSutskever is joined in his new venture by Daniel Gross, who formerly directed Apple's AI efforts, and Daniel Levy, another ex-OpenAi researcher. The startup has offices in Tel Aviv and Palo Alto, California.\n\nAlongside Jan Leike -- who also left OpenAI in May and now works at Anthropic, an AI firm started by former OpenAI employees -- Sutskever led OpenAI's Superalignment team. The team was focused on controlling AI systems and ensuring that advanced AI wouldn't pose a danger to humanity. It was dissolved shortly after both leaders departed.\n\nSafe Intelligence -- as implied from its name -- will be focusing on similar safety efforts to what Sutskever's old team did.\n\n\"SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus,\" the company's co-founders wrote in a public letter. \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nThe firm is also promising that its \"singular focus\" will prevent management interference or product cycles from getting in the way of their work. Several members of OpenAI, including founding member Andrej Karpathy, have left the company in recent months. Several former staffers last month signed an open letter raising the alarm over \"serious risks\" at OpenAI over oversight and transparency issues.\n\nSutskever was one of OpenAI's board members who attempted to oust fellow co-founder and CEO Sam Altman in November, who was quickly reinstated. The directors had criticisms over Altman's handling of AI safety and allegations of abusive behavior. Former board member Helen Toner has said Altman's manipulative behavior and lies had created a toxic culture that executives labeled \"toxic abuse.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Levy_(Canadian_actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Levy (Canadian actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/2ec493951dd5bcb309389d43ff5e5802.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\nOpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever announced he is launching a new AI firm that will primarily focus on developing a \"safe superintelligence.\"\n\nFormer OpenAI member Daniel Levy and former Apple AI lead Daniel Gross are also co-founders of the firm, dubbed Safe Superintelligence Inc., according to the June 19 announcement.\n\nAccording to the firm, superintelligence is \"within reach,\" and ensuring that it is \"safe\" for humans is the \"most important technical challenge of our age.\"\n\nThe firm added that it intends to be a \"straight-shot safe superintelligence (SSI) lab\" with technology as its sole product and safety its primary goal. It added:\n\n\"We are assembling a lean, cracked team of the world's best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on SSI and nothing else.\"\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc. said it aims to advance capabilities as quickly as possible while pursuing safety. The firm's focused approach means that management, overhead, short-term commercial pressures, and product cycles will not divert it from its goal.\n\n\"This way, we can scale in peace.\"\n\nThe firm added that investors are on board with the approach of prioritizing safe development over everything else.\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview, Sutskever declined to name financial backers or state the amount raised so far, while Gross commented broadly and said that \"raising capital is not going to be\" an issue for the company.\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc. will be based in Palo Alto, California, with offices in Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nThe launch of Safe Superintelligence follows a dispute at OpenAI. Sutskever was part of the group that attempted to remove OpenAI CEO Sam Altman from his role in November 2023.\n\nEarly reporting, including from The Atlantic, suggested that safety was a concern at the company around the time of the dispute. Meanwhile, an internal company memo suggested Altman's attempted firing was related to a communication breakdown between him and the firm's board of directors.\n\nSutskever left the public eye for months after the incident and officially left Open AI a few weeks ago in May. He did not cite any reasons for his departure, but recent developments at the AI firm have brought the issue of AI safety to the forefront.\n\nOpenAI employees Jan Leike and Gretchen Krueger recently left the firm, citing concerns about AI safety. Meanwhile, reports from Vox suggest that at least five other \"safety-conscious employees\" have left since November.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Sutskever said that he maintains a good relationship with Altman and said OpenAI is aware of the new company \"in broad strokes.\"", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_dalton@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Mike Dalton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ai-merge.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 440, "textEnd": 447}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

They share a similar vision of having a \"small, lean, cracked team\" solely focused on AI safety.\n\nSafe Superintelligence would be based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv.\n\nSafe Superintelligence was a throwback to what OpenAI was initially conceptualized as: a research firm trying to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that could equal or surpass humans on many tasks.\n\nHowever, without further information, investors would have to gamble that Safe Superintelligence would hit breakthroughs and give it an edge over its rivals.", "source": {"uri": "vcpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Venture Capital Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_resurreccion@vcpost.com", "name": "Jose Resurreccion", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://data.vcpost.com/data/thumbs/full/106203/620/0/0/0/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-reveals-new-ai-startup-safe-superintelligence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

It aims to produce superintelligence -- a machine that is more intelligent than humans -- in a safe way, according to company spokesperson Lulu Cheng Meservey.\n\nSutskever, who has said he regretted moving against Altman, declined to comment. The news was reported earlier by Bloomberg.\n\nSutskever, 38, left OpenAI last month and announced at the time that he would be starting a new project but did not provide details. Meservey declined to name who is funding the company or how much it has raised. She said that as it builds safe superintelligence, the company will not release other products.\n\nSutskever founded the company alongside Daniel Gross, who worked on AI at Apple, and Daniel Levy, who worked with Sutskever at OpenAI. Sutskever's title at the new company will be chief scientist, but he describes his role, according to Meservey, as \"responsible for revolutionary breakthroughs.\"\n\nIn November 2022, OpenAI captured the world's imagination with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write term papers, generate computer code and even mimic human conversation. The tech industry rapidly embraced what it called generative artificial intelligence: technologies that can generate text, images and other media.\n\nMany experts believe these technologies are poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants. Some believe this transformation will have as big an impact as the web browser or the smartphone.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.)\n\nAltman became the face of the movement toward generative AI as he met with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world and testified before Congress. In November, Sutskever and three other OpenAI board members unexpectedly ousted him, saying they could no longer trust him with the company's plan to one day create a machine that can do anything the human brain can do.\n\nDays later, after hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Altman. Altman returned as CEO after he and the board agreed to replace two board members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Sutskever effectively stepped down from the board.\n\nLast year, Sutskever helped create what was called a Superalignment team inside OpenAI that aimed to ensure that future AI technologies would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that AI could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.\n\nJan Leike, who ran the Superalignment team alongside Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. He has since been hired by OpenAI's competitor Anthropic, another company founded by former OpenAI researchers.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Summers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

When he left OpenAI, he said that he had plans for a \"very personally meaningful\" project, but offered no details.\n\nSutskever said that it was his choice to leave OpenAI.\n\nDays after his departure, his team co-leader Jan Leike also resigned and leveled criticism at OpenAI for letting safety \"take a backseat to shiny products.\" OpenAI later announced the formation of a safety and security committee, but it's been filled mainly with company insiders.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of the AP's text archives.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text-to-image model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/preview-1673.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, Sutskever tweeted that he's starting a company called Safe Superintelligence.\n\n\"We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product. We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team,\" wrote Sutskever.\n\nThe company's website is currently just a text message signed by Sutskever as well as co-founders Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy (Gross was a co-founder of search engine Cue, which was acquired by Apple in 2013, while Levy ran the Optimization team at OpenAI). The message reiterates safety as the key component of building an artificial superintelligence.\n\n\"We approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead,\" the message reads. \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nWhile Sutskever never publicly explained why he left OpenAI, instead praising the company's \"miraculous\" trajectory, it's notable that safety is at the centre of his new AI product. Musk and several others warned that OpenAI is reckless about building AGI (artificial general intelligence), and the very departure of Sutskever and others in OpenAI's safety-focused team indicate the company may have been lax when it comes to making sure AGI is being built in a safe way. Musk also has beef with Microsoft's involvment in OpenAI, claiming that the company has been transformed from an nonprofit into a \"closed-source de facto subsidiary\" of Microsoft.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, published on Wednesday, Sutskever and co-founders did not name any backers, though Gross said that raising capital is not going to be a problem for the startup.

This venture comes shortly after Sutskever's departure from OpenAI, marking a significant shift in his career towards a singular focus on AI safety. SSI, which Sutskever co-founded with former Apple AI lead Daniel Gross and ex-OpenAI engineer Daniel Levy, aims to develop a safe and powerful AI system, prioritising safety alongside capabilities.\n\nAnnouncing his new company on X, Sutskever wrote, \"I am starting a new company.\" In another tweet, he mentioned that his new company will pursue \"safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product.\"\n\nThe announcement of SSI highlights the company's commitment to advancing AI technology while ensuring safety remains at the forefront. Sutskever's vision for SSI is clear: \"one goal and one product,\" focusing exclusively on creating superintelligent AI systems that are both advanced and safe. This approach allows SSI to avoid the distractions and pressures often faced by larger AI firms, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, which have to balance innovation with commercial and management demands.\n\nSutskever's departure from OpenAI made a lot of headlines earlier this year. He played a key role in the attempt to oust OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a move that led to significant internal conflict. Following this tumultuous period, Sutskever expressed regret for his involvement, emphasising his dedication to the mission they had built together at OpenAI. This experience seems to have shaped his approach at SSI, where the focus is on maintaining a stable and undistracted path towards safe AI development.\n\nSSI's approach to AI safety is rooted in the lessons learned from OpenAI. At OpenAI, Sutskever co-led the Superalignment team with Jan Leike, who also left the company in May to join Anthropic, a rival AI firm. The Superalignment team was dedicated to controlling and steering AI systems to ensure they remain beneficial. This mission continues at SSI, where safety and capabilities are treated as intertwined challenges to be addressed through innovative engineering and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Sutskever outlined SSI's business model, which is designed to insulate safety, security, and progress from short-term commercial pressures. This structure allows the company to focus solely on its mission without the distractions of management overhead or product cycles. Unlike OpenAI, which evolved from a non-profit to a for-profit entity due to the high costs of AI development, SSI has been established as a for-profit company from the outset, with a clear emphasis on raising capital to support its ambitious goals.\n\nSSI is currently building its team and has set up offices in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv.

He earlier resigned from the ChatGPT developer's board. Sutskever's departure is believed to be connected to his role in the brief ouster of OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman last November.\n\nSSI has offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. The company is incorporated as Safe Superintelligence Inc., a nod to its goal of prioritizing AI safety in its development efforts. \"We approach safety and capabilities in tandem,\" reads a brief announcement on SSI's one-page website. \"We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\"\n\nSutskever co-founded OpenAI in 2015 after helping to develop AlexNet, a groundbreaking computer vision model, at the University of Toronto. AlexNet demonstrated that AI models running on graphics processing units can be used for practical tasks. The algorithm is credited with inspiring a significant amount of subsequent research into deep learning.\n\nSutskever spent the three years that preceded the launch of OpenAI at Google LLC, where he made contributions to TensorFlow. He also worked on Seq2seq, a language model series that preceded the Transformer architecture and shares certain features with the latter technology.\n\nSutskever established SSI with former OpenAI researcher Daniel Levy and Daniel Gross, a one-time Y Combinator partner who at one point led Apple Inc.'s AI efforts. In the announcement posted on SSI's website today, the three founders wrote that the company's \"team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI.\" This hints that the company has secured venture funding.\n\nSutskever told Bloomberg that SSI \"will not do anything else\" besides its effort to develop a safe superintelligence. That indicates the company likely won't seek to commercialize its research in the near future.\n\nIn today's launch announcement, SSI's three founders didn't specify what approaches it will take to ensure the safety of its AI models. Before leaving OpenAI, Sutskever co-led a group known as the Superalignment team that explored ways of mitigating the risks posed by advanced neural networks. The since-disbanded group's research may provide an indication of how SSI plans to tackle AI safety.\n\nIn a paper published last November, the Superalignment team detailed an AI safety approach known as weak-to-strong generalization.

Today, a little over month since he departed OpenAI, Sutskever has announced the launch of his new venture, Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI). The company was incorporated in Delaware on June 6 and will have offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv.\n\nSSI is being described as the world's first \"straight-shot superintelligence lab\". Reportedly, it will focus solely on building a safe and powerful AI system, and has no near-term plans of selling AI products or services.\n\n\"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then,\" Sutskever explained in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg. \"It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.\"\n\nJoining Sutskever in this endeavor are two co-founders: Daniel Gross, a prominent investor and former Apple Inc. AI lead, and Daniel Levy, an AI researcher who worked alongside Sutskever at OpenAI.\n\nSSI's emphasis on prioritizing safety over short-term commercial gains is a notable stance. This singular focus will immediately set it apart from other AI research labs who often find themselves juggling multiple projects and products.\n\nHowever, the economic realities of the AI industry, including the ever-growing computational demands and the need for substantial funding, make SSI a gamble for investors. And while Sutskever and his team are confident in their ability to secure the necessary capital to get started, we will see how long that appetite will last.\n\nAdditionally, the very nature of their endeavor -- creating a superintelligence -- will scrutiny and skepticism. The state-of-the-art in AI today is still far from achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), let alone superintelligence. The very concept of \"safety\" in AI remains elusive and open to interpretation.\n\nDespite these challenges, the pedigree and expertise of SSI's founding team cannot be overlooked. Sutskever, Gross, and Levy bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the table, and their decision to embark on this ambitious project is a testament to their belief in the potential of superintelligence and the importance of developing it safely.", "source": {"uri": "maginative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maginative"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_scientific_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief scientific officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.maginative.com/content/images/size/w1200/2024/06/SSI-Ilya.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 485, "textEnd": 491}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Sutskever was one of the OpenAI board members who sought to oust CEO Sam Altman in November, a management coup that ultimately failed after a majority of employees, including eventually Sutskever himself, demanded his reinstatement following an intervention by Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI.\n\nSutskever finally left OpenAI in May, without ever going public on the reasons behind his decision, or for his original support for moves to replace Altman.\n\nWhile OpenAI began in 2015 as a non-profit with the goal of conducting research and development into artificial general intelligence (AGI) with the goal that it be built in a way that benefits humanity as a whole, the company changed its focus over the years. Now very much a for-profit company, former employees have accused OpenAI of sidelining AI safety in pursuit of financial reward.\n\nSSI currently consists of three people: Sutskever, Daniel Levy, another former OpenAI employee, and serial AI investor Daniel Gross. The post says that the startup is an American company based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, and that it is \"assembling a lean, cracked (sic) team\" of the world's \"best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on SSI and nothing else\".\n\nThere is no public information about any investors in the company.\n\nSSI is not the first startup to be founded by ex-OpenAI employees.

Sutskever has stated that the organization's sole aim will be the development of a safe superintelligence, steering clear of product development and market rivalry.\n\n\"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then\", Sutskever told Bloomberg. \"It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race\", he added.\n\nSSI will establish offices in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Palo Alto, California. Joining Sutskever are co-founders Daniel Levy, an ex-OpenAI researcher, and Daniel Gross, who led AI projects at Apple. This diverse team combines significant expertise and experience in AI research.\n\nThe formation of SSI underscores a growing concern for AI safety and ethics in the development of advanced systems. By separating research from commercial incentives, Sutskever says he aims to uphold the highest standards of safety and responsibility. This could influence other AI research organizations to similarly prioritize ethical considerations over market competition.\n\nFollowing his exit from OpenAI in May, amid Jan Leike's resignation from OpenAI's superalignment team citing a focus shift away from safety, Sutskever has remained supportive of the company's leadership.\n\nSutskever's departure from OpenAI followed the unveiling of the company\u00b4s latest generative AI model, GPT-4o, and major upgrades to the AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nA week before Thanksgiving 2023, Ilya Sutskever and OpenAI's CTO Mira Murati brought concerns regarding Sam Altman's behavior to the attention of the former board of directors, allegedly due to disputes about the direction of OpenAI. The previous board, counting Sutskever among its members, suddenly decided to terminate Altman's employment without informing the majority of OpenAI's employees. They attributed the dismissal to Altman's inconsistent transparency in his dealings with the board.\n\nThe decision incensed Microsoft and other investors, imperiled the company's stock sale, and prompted the majority of OpenAI employees, including Sutskever, to threaten resignation unless Altman was restored to his position. Altman was eventually reinstated, and much of the old board resigned. Sutskever never returned to work after that. Jakub Pachocki has effectively served as chief AI scientist at OpenAI since November last year.\n\nWhile Sutskever is doubling down on AI Safety, OpenAI is still in the process of restructuring.

It aims to produce superintelligence -- a machine that is more intelligent than humans -- in a safe way, according to company spokesperson Lulu Cheng Meservey.\n\nSutskever, who has said he regretted moving against Altman, declined to comment.

Meservey declined to name who is funding the company or how much it has raised. She said that as it builds safe superintelligence, the company will not release other products.\n\nSutskever founded the company alongside Daniel Gross, who worked on AI at Apple, and Daniel Levy, who worked with Sutskever at OpenAI. Sutskever's title at the new company will be chief scientist, but he describes his role, according to Meservey, as \"responsible for revolutionary breakthroughs.\"\n\nIn November 2022, OpenAI captured the world's imagination with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write term papers, generate computer code and even mimic human conversation. The tech industry rapidly embraced what it called generative artificial intelligence: technologies that can generate text, images and other media.\n\nMany experts believe these technologies are poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants. Some believe this transformation will have as big an impact as the web browser or the smartphone.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.)\n\nAltman became the face of the movement toward generative AI as he met with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world and testified before Congress. In November, Sutskever and three other OpenAI board members unexpectedly ousted him, saying they could no longer trust him with the company's plan to one day create a machine that can do anything the human brain can do.\n\nDays later, after hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Altman. Altman returned as CEO after he and the board agreed to replace two board members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Sutskever effectively stepped down from the board.\n\nLast year, Sutskever helped create what was called a Superalignment team inside OpenAI that aimed to ensure that future AI technologies would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that AI could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.\n\nJan Leike, who ran the Superalignment team alongside Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. He has since been hired by OpenAI's competitor Anthropic, another company founded by former OpenAI researchers.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Summers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

His departure came after his controversial involvement in the ouster of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI in late 2023, a decision he later reversed by supporting Altman's reinstatement.\n\nIn mid-May, Sutskever formally announced his exit from OpenAI, hinting that future \"personally meaningful\" projects would be revealed \"in due time.\"\n\nNow, Sutskever has unveiled Safe Superintelligence Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to creating advanced AI systems primarily focusing on safety.\n\n\"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then,\" Sutskever stated in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg.\n\nThe organization seeks to distance itself from the commercial and competitive pressures that companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic face, allowing it to focus solely on research and development.\n\nRead Also: Vox Media, The Atlantic Partner with OpenAI to Provide Content for ChatGPT\n\nThe new venture emphasizes AI safety, which Sutskever likens to \"nuclear safety\" rather than typical \"trust and safety\" measures. This distinction highlights the organization's commitment to fundamentally engineering safety into AI systems from the ground up rather than adding protective measures as an afterthought.\n\n\"Safe superintelligence should have the property that it will not harm humanity at a large scale,\" Sutskever explained, aiming to create an AI that promotes key democratic values such as liberty, democracy, and freedom.\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc. is co-founded by Daniel Gross, a former Apple AI lead and investor known for backing numerous high-profile AI startups, and Daniel Levy, an expert in training large AI models who previously worked with Sutskever at OpenAI. The organization will operate out of Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, reflecting the co-founders' Israeli roots.\n\nIn essence, Sutskever's new AI venture represents a return to OpenAI's original mission. OpenAI started as a research-focused entity before evolving into a commercial organization focused on revenue-generating products due to the immense costs associated with developing advanced AI technologies.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by Elon Musk, who, in a lawsuit that he later dismissed, claimed that OpenAI had shifted away from its initial goal of developing AI openly and for the benefit of humanity.

Altman spoke mainly about the benefits of AI and was busy persuading the audience why it would change the world for the better. Sutskever, the more charismatic of the two, shared with the audience with animated hand movements and an authoritative voice, his concerns about the capabilities of advanced AI that could get out of control.\n\n\"There will be bad people who can use AI in powerful ways,\" he said. \"And we'll have to limit the ways to use it. It's a very powerful technology and we still haven't reached its full potential. You could use it to cure all diseases, but you could also use it to create a disease that's much worse than anything known. If it gets out of control, it will be very bad. It would be a big mistake to build advanced AI that we don't know how to control.\"\n\nSutskever's warning, heard in Tel Aviv, was echoed in the relationship between him and Altman over the past year, until Sutskever stepped down from OpenAI last month. Last November, Sutskever participated the ousting of Altman and other company executives due to his concern that Altman is leading OpenAI in directions that are too commercial, and is not taking care to adequately curb future AI technologies that involve risks.\n\nTo justify the ousting, Sutskever, along with several members of the board, quoted the OpenAI charter that anyone violating the company's overarching aim to develop advanced AI for the benefit of humanity on a non-profit basis could face removal. Sutskever eventually backed down over the ousting, and Altman was brought back under pressure from investors and its major partner Microsoft.\n\nAfter that it was only a matter of time before Sutskever found himself on the outside. Six months after the failed attempt to oust Altman, Sutskever announced his departure, and yesterday announced the founding of a new company called Safe Superintelligence (SSI), which aims to build advanced but safe AI.\n\nSutskever presented two of his partners in the project: Daniel Levy, a former senior executive at OpenAI, who formerly worked with Sutskever at Google, and Daniel Gross, a former Israeli who was director of AI at Apple and was a partner in the prestigious YCombinator accelerator.\n\nGross grew up in Jerusalem's Katamon neighborhood, and studied in the Horev Yeshiva high school and the Mercaz Harav Yeshiva before jopining the YCombinator when it was managed by Sam Altman. Sutskever also grew up in Israel after immigrating to the country with his parents from Russia. He graduated from the Open University in 2002 before receiving a M.Sc. and PhD at University of Toronto, where he became a renowned AI researcher.\n\nSutskever has said that the company will have offices in California and Tel Aviv but so far it is not known of any offices that SSI has leased nor if the hiring process has begun. That said the announcement by a mega entrepreneur that the company will set up a development center in Tel Aviv in the midst of a war and storm over Israel's image is good news for the local tech industry, which is not in the forefront of AI, except for Nvidia's activities in the country.\n\nGroup 11 founding partner Dovi Frances, who brought Sutskever to Israel as part of the OpenAI delegation last year said, \"The visit gave him a taste of the talent that is here. The fact that the most important and most sought-after figure in the world of AI and the undisputed father of the AI revolution chose to found an operation in Israel cannot be taken for granted due to the global criticism of Israel and the tensions that have existed here since the start of 2023. This is an important statement towards the industry by Silicon Valley, and also towards some of the senior leaders in Israeli high-tech.\"\n\nThe company will be insulated from external pressures\n\nAs one of the founders of OpenAI, Sutskever's dissatisfaction with the path taken by the company was also expressed in his implicit criticism of the commercial companies in the field. SSI, unlike OpenAI, Entropik and Israel's AI21 Labs, is being founded as a non-profit organization with no plans to sell AI products or services, Sutskever told \"Bloomberg.\" He said, \"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then. It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a rat race.\"\n\nAnd what is the Superintelligence that Sutskever is talking about? It is a marketing term for the more scientific concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which describes systems able to learn by themselves based on making smart decisions. \"No one really knows what superintelligence is, these are terms that are thrown into the air,\" says Prof. Meir Feder, head of the Center for AI and Data Science at Tel Aviv University.\n\n\"What we are seeing is that there is gradual technological progress in the ability of a machine to make a decision through the use of statistical models, based on a certain database, and based on different criteria. It can replace search engines, write code or draw, but this is not a phenomenon that I would call intelligence. The AI revolution has progressed from object recognition and speech recognition based on patterns, to analyzing and understanding language.\n\nWhen we talk about AGI, we are talking about a process in which a machine learns in a way that resembles a human who doesn't need billions of documents to learn a language, but uses a few examples. This is how we would like to see it learn quickly, using a little data. They are talking about this issue, but no one knows if it is possible, where it will lead and what will happen with it. The safety that is required here is not unusual from the safety characteristics that are required in any new technology.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Sutskever shed light on his plans. He said in current systems, \"You talk to it (the chat bot), you have a conversation, and you're done.\" Autonomous, that's crazy, right? And we want to make it safer.\"\n\n\"Building OpenAI anew\"\n\nTel Aviv University Industrial Engineering Department head in the Faculty of Engineering Prof. Eran Toch said, \"OpenAI was founded as a not-for-profit organization to create open models to work with on ethics, safety, and commercial aspects, in contrast to Google and Microsoft, but it didn't go in that direction in the end.\"\n\n\"Due to its great success, a kind of \"parasite\" developed in this organization, a commercial company that was developed as a spin-off and that promises open models, and ethics committees that examined moral aspects and open research - we got nothing in the end, except for a company that sells its products to Microsoft and Apple. Contrary to the company's name, it first launched open models, but very quickly it moved to launching closed models. To a large extent, with people who accompanied him a long way at OpenAI, Sutskever is rebuilding OpenAI as it was supposed to be in his vision, for the existence of which he paid the price with his job.\"\n\nSuch a company would certainly require a lot of funding and hardware equipment costing billions of dollars. Investors will not be encouraged to invest in a non-profit, but according to Prof. Toch, achieving AGI is possible and closer than ever, and not necessarily very expensive. \"The large supply of AI models in open source allows entities like SSI to take them and train and work with them on the issues they want to develop. There is no need to develop everything anew, as was the case when OpenAI was founded,\" he says.", "source": {"uri": "globes.co.il", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05e1"},

He is heading for a new journey and has founded Safe Superintelligence Inc., a company which will focus on the safe development of superintelligent AI systems. The announcement surfaced after the departure of Sutskever from OpenAI, where he was one of the key players in developing advanced AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc. aims at pioneering the safe development of AI systems which will surpass human intelligence- often referred to as superintelligence. Sutskever and his co-founders, Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy have emphasized their commitment towards safety and security in AI, which has explicitly stated that their new enterprise would be shielded from the typical commercial pressures and management distractions that can sideline such priorities.\n\nHeadquartered in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel, Safe Superintelligence Inc. will leverage these tech hubs to recruit top-tier technical talent. Sutskever, along with Gross and Levy, will note that their choice of these locations highlights their deep connections and strategic advantage in accessing the best minds in AI research and development.\n\nSutskever's departure from OpenAI has marked a significant shift in his career and the decision was followed by a tumultuous period at OpenAI, where he had been part of a controversial attempt to expel the CEO Sam Altman.\n\nThe move, after which Sutskever later expressed regret, was highlighted as the internal conflicts regarding the prioritization of AI safety versus business opportunities. His exit, along with the subsequent resignation of Jan Leike, who co-led the safety team, and further signalled growing concerns about the direction OpenAI was taking.\n\nSutskever and his co-founders made it clear that Safe Superintelligence Inc. will not be swayed by the need for immediate product cycles or profit motives. Their goal is to ensure that the development of superintelligent AI adheres strictly to safety and ethical guidelines, free from the constraints that often accompany traditional business models.\n\nAs Sutskever embarks on this new venture, the AI community watches with keen interest. His departure from OpenAI and the founding of Safe Superintelligence Inc. highlight ongoing debates within the field about balancing rapid AI advancement with the imperative of ensuring these technologies develop in ways that are safe and beneficial for humanity.\n\nALSO READ: Lenovo Legion Go launching on June 27 in India: Details", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saumya_nigam@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Saumya Nigam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/06/openai-1718888830.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2589, "textEnd": 2596}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

But he left OpenAI earlier this year, after a rocky period that saw it try to remove its chief executive, Sam Altman.\n\nReports have suggested that Mr Sutskever was one of many concerned that OpenAI was focusing too much on the commercial possibilities of its technology, and not enough on the safety issues that it had been created to address.\n\nNow Mr Sutskever said he has launched a new organisation, focused specifically on safety. It is called Safe Superintelligence and that building safe AI was \"our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap\".\n\nIn a launch statement on the new company's website, the firm said it would approach \"safety and capabilities in tandem\" as \"technical problems to be solved\" and to \"advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead\".\n\nSome critics have raised concerns that major tech and AI firms are too focused on reaping the commercial benefits of the emerging technology, and are neglecting safety principles in the process - an issue raised in recent months by several former OpenAI staff members when announcing they were leaving the company.\n\nElon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has also accused the company of abandoning its original mission to develop open-source AI to focus on commercial gain.\n\nIn what appeared to be a direct response to those concerns, Safe Superintelligence's launch statement said: \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nMr Sutskever was involved in the high-profile attempt to oust Sam Altman as OpenAI chief executive last year, and was removed from the company's board following Mr Altman's swift return before leaving the company in May this year.\n\nHe has been joined at Safe Superintelligence by former OpenAI researcher Daniel Levy and former Apple AI lead Daniel Gross - both are named as co-founders at the new firm, which has offices in California and Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nThe trio said the company was \"the world's first straight-shot SSI (safe superintelligence) lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence\", calling it the \"most important technical problem of our time\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerging technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/14/09/SEI200986108.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

(SSI) with the goal of safely building \"superintelligence,\" which is a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence, possibly in the extreme.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\"We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product,\" wrote Sutskever on X. \"We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.\"\n\nSutskever was a founding member of OpenAI and formerly served as the company's chief scientist. Two others are joining Sutskever at SSI initially: Daniel Levy, who formerly headed the Optimization Team at OpenAI, and Daniel Gross, an AI investor who worked on machine learning projects at Apple between 2013 and 2017. The trio posted a statement on the company's new website.\n\nSutskever and several of his co-workers resigned from OpenAI in May, six months after Sutskever played a key role in ousting OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who later returned. While Sutskever did not publicly complain about OpenAI after his departure -- and OpenAI executives such as Altman wished him well on his new adventures -- another resigning member of OpenAI's Superalignment team, Jan Leike, publicly complained that \"over the past years, safety culture and processes [had] taken a backseat to shiny products\" at OpenAI. Leike joined OpenAI competitor Anthropic later in May.\n\nA nebulous concept\n\nOpenAI is currently seeking to create AGI, or artificial general intelligence, which would hypothetically match human intelligence at performing a wide variety of tasks without specific training. Sutskever hopes to jump beyond that in a straight moonshot attempt, with no distractions along the way.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then,\" said Sutskever in an interview with Bloomberg. \"It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.\"\n\nDuring his former job at OpenAI, Sutskever was part of the \"Superalignment\" team studying how to \"align\" (shape the behavior of) this hypothetical form of AI, sometimes called \"ASI\" for \"artificial super intelligence,\" to be beneficial to humanity.\n\nAs you can imagine, it's difficult to align something that does not exist, so Sutskever's quest has met skepticism at times. On X, University of Washington computer science professor (and frequent OpenAI critic) Pedro Domingos wrote, \"Ilya Sutskever's new company is guaranteed to succeed, because superintelligence that is never achieved is guaranteed to be safe.\"\n\nMuch like AGI, superintelligence is a nebulous term. Since the mechanics of human intelligence are still poorly understood -- and since human intelligence is difficult to quantify or define since there is no one set type of human intelligence -- identifying superintelligence when it arrives may be tricky.\n\nAlready, computers far surpass humans in many forms of information processing (such as basic math), but are they superintelligent? Many proponents of superintelligence imagine a sci-fi scenario of an \"alien intelligence\" with a form of sentience that operates independently of humans, and that is more or less what Sutskever hopes to achieve and control safely.\n\n\"You're talking about a giant super data center that's autonomously developing technology,\" he told Bloomberg. \"That's crazy, right? It's the safety of that that we want to contribute to.\"", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benj_edwards@arstechnica.com", "name": "Benj Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_scientific_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief scientific officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Domingos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Domingos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sentience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sutskever_altman_header-760x380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He now finds a home at Safe Superintelligence, alongside ex-OpenAI researcher Daniel Levy and former Apple AI lead Daniel Gross, both of whom are co-founders of the new firm with offices in California and Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nReferring to the new venture, they claimed: \"It's the world's first straight-shot SSI (safe superintelligence) lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.\" They said it was \"most important technical problem of our time\".", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martyn_landi@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Martyn Landi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Levy_(Canadian_actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Levy (Canadian actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33070203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ilya-sutskever-is-launching-safe-superintelligence-tim-goodepa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

In a farewell post he published on X on May 14, Sutskever only said that he was going to work on a \"project that is very personally meaningful\" to him.\n\nThe company's board said in a statement on November 17, 2023, that Altman's removal came after he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board\" but did not give further details.\n\nSutskever later expressed regret for his decision and called for Altman's reinstatement alongside other OpenAI employees.\n\nAltman was eventually brought back as CEO just five days after he was ousted, but the incident appeared to drive a wedge between him and Sutskever.\n\nFollowing Altman's return, Sutskever appeared to have been shut out of OpenAI, BI reported in December, citing people familiar with the situation.\n\nThis isn't the first time OpenAI has seen its staff members splintering off to start their own AI companies.\n\nIn 2021, former OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded their own AI startup, Anthropic.

The story was reported earlier by Bloomberg.\n\nDr. Sutskever, 38, left OpenAI last month, announcing at the time that she was starting a new project but giving no details.

Sutskever's title at the new company will be chief scientist, but Meservey said he describes his role as one of being responsible for revolutionary breakthroughs.\n\nIn November 2022, OpenAI attracted worldwide attention with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that can answer questions, write term papers, generate computer code, and even mimic human conversation. The tech industry has rapidly embraced what's known as generative artificial intelligence, a technology that can generate text, images, and other media.\n\nMany experts believe these technologies will reshape everything from email programs to internet search engines to digital assistants, with some saying the transformation will be as impactful as that of web browsers and smartphones.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement of news content related to the AI system.)\n\nAltman became the face of the movement for generative AI, meeting with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world and testifying before Congress. In November, Dr. Sutskever and three other OpenAI executives abruptly fired him, saying they could no longer trust him with the company's plans to one day build machines that can do anything the human brain can.\n\nDays later, after hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign, Dr. Sutskever said he regretted the decision to fire Altman. Altman returned as CEO after reaching a deal with the board to replace two directors with former Salesforce.com executive Brett Taylor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Dr. Sutskever effectively resigned from the board.\n\nLast year, Dr. Sutskever helped found a team within OpenAI called the Superalignment Team, which aims to ensure that future AI technology will not do harm.

We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead,\" the statement said.\n\nSutskever has co-founded this pioneering initiative with Daniel Levy, a former OpenAI employee, and Daniel Gross, an AI investor and entrepreneur with stakes in prominent tech companies like GitHub and Instacart, as well as AI ventures including Perplexity.ai, Character.ai, and CoreWeave.\n\nThe founders emphasize that SSI's mission is singular and undistracted by the need for revenue generation, allowing them to attract top talent dedicated solely to the development of safe superintelligence -- an advanced form of AI that could surpass human cognitive abilities. This focus is intended to free the company from the short-term commercial pressures that can compromise safety and ethical considerations.\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures,\" Sutskever said on X.\n\nSSI will operate with headquarters in both Palo Alto and Tel Aviv.\n\nSutskever's departure from OpenAI followed a period of internal turbulence at the leading AI company. In November, OpenAI's board, which included Sutskever at the time, made a controversial decision to oust Altman. The move, which shocked investors and staff alike, was quickly reversed, with Altman reinstated under a new board configuration, leading to Sutskever's resignation in May. At the time of his departure, Sutskever hinted at an exciting new project that held personal significance for him.\n\nThe founders of SSI assert that their exclusive focus on developing safe superintelligence will insulate their work from the distractions of management overhead and product development cycles. This approach harks back to OpenAI's original mission when it was founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab aimed at creating beneficial superintelligent AI.\n\nUnder Altman's leadership, OpenAI has transformed from a non-profit research institution into a rapidly expanding business. Despite this growth, the company has faced internal strife regarding its leadership direction and the prioritization of AI safety. Jan Leike, another recent OpenAI departure who worked closely with Sutskever, joined the rival start-up Anthropic, citing growing tensions over the diminishing emphasis on safety protocols at OpenAI.\n\nThe Rise of Spin-Offs\n\nSSI is not the first significant spin-off from OpenAI. In 2021, Dario Amodei, formerly head of AI safety at OpenAI, founded Anthropic, a start-up committed to developing safe AI systems. Anthropic has since secured $4 billion in funding from Amazon and hundreds of millions more from venture capitalists, achieving a valuation exceeding $18 billion.\n\nWidening The Safety Concern\n\nThe rapid proliferation of AI companies like SSI and Anthropic underlines the urgent need for robust AI regulation. As these companies push the boundaries of AI capabilities, the potential risks associated with superintelligent AI -- ranging from ethical concerns to safety and security issues -- become increasingly pronounced.\n\nThe influx of new AI enterprises necessitates comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure that advancements in AI technology are managed responsibly and ethically.\n\nRegulators worldwide are beginning to recognize this need. The European Union's AI Act, for instance, aims to create a legal framework to manage the risks associated with AI. Similarly, in the United States, there is growing bipartisan support for more stringent AI regulations to safeguard against potential misuse and ensure that AI development aligns with broader societal values.\n\nThe announcement of SSI has garnered significant attention within the tech community. Sutskever's reputation as a leading AI researcher and his instrumental role in OpenAI's early successes lend substantial credibility to the new venture. This move also highlights ongoing concerns about AI safety and governance within the rapidly evolving industry.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_nwite@tekedia.com", "name": "Samuel Nwite", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character.ai", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character.ai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20085528/SSI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

(SSI). The new company's goal and product are evident from its name.\n\nSSI is a United States company with offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. It will advance artificial intelligence (AI) by developing safety and capabilities in tandem, the trio of founders said in an online announcement on June 19.

Daniel Levy was among the researchers who left OpenAI a few days after Sutskever.\n\nRelated: OpenAI makes ChatGPT 'less verbose,' blurring writer-AI distinction\n\nSutskever and Jan Leike were the leaders of OpenAI's Superalignment team created in July 2023 to consider how to \"steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\" Such systems are referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI allotted 20% of its computing power to the Superalignment team at the time of its creation.\n\nLeike also left OpenAI in May and is now the head of a team at Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic. OpenAI defended its safety-related precautions in a long X post by company president Greg Brockman but dissolved the Superalignment team after the May departure of its researchers.\n\nOther top tech figures worry too\n\nThe former OpenAI researchers are among many scientists concerned about the future direction of AI. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Butertin called AGI \"risky\" in the midst of the staff turnover at OpenAI. He added, however, that \"such models are also much lower in terms of doom risk than both corporate megalomania and militaries.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, once an OpenAI supporter, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak were among more than 2,600 tech leaders and researchers who urged that the training of AI systems be paused for six months while humanity pondered the \"profound risk\" they represented.\n\nThe SSI announcement noted that the company is hiring engineers and researchers.", "source": {"uri": "cointelegraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cointelegraph"}, "authors":

This new enterprise aims to focus exclusively on the safe creation of \"superintelligence\" -- AI systems surpassing human intelligence.\n\nIn a public statement, Sutskever and his partners emphasized their commitment to avoiding the typical distractions of management and product cycles.

Safe Superintelligence is rooted in both Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, leveraging their strong connections in these regions to attract top-tier technical talent.\n\nThis announcement follows Sutskever's involvement in a failed attempt to oust OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year, a move that sparked significant internal conflict regarding the balance between business pursuits and AI safety priorities at OpenAI. Sutskever has since expressed regret over the boardroom upheaval.\n\nAt OpenAI, Sutskever co-led a team working on the safe advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), AI systems with capabilities beyond human intelligence. Upon his departure, he hinted at a \"very personally meaningful\" project, the details of which remained undisclosed until now.\n\nThe resignation of Jan Leike, Sutskever's team co-leader at OpenAI, shortly followed Sutskever's exit. Leike criticized OpenAI for prioritizing product development over safety. In response, OpenAI formed a safety and security committee, although it predominantly comprises internal members.\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc. represents Sutskever's intent to address these safety concerns by focusing entirely on the secure development of superintelligent AI, free from the pressures that he believes compromised his previous work at OpenAI.\n\n3.6 Crore Indians visited in a single day choosing us as India's undisputed platform for General Election Results.

Sutskever also built AlexNet, a neural network focused on image processing, in collaboration with Hinton and Alex Krizhevsky, which sold to Google in 2013.\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles.\"\n\nIn addition to Sutskever, SSI's other founders include Daniel Levy, a former member of technical staff at OpenAI, and Daniel Gross, Apple's former AI lead. According to Sutskever's LinkedIn, he will serve as both co-founder and chief scientist at SSI.\n\nIn a statement posted today on its new website, the company described itself as \"the world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.\"\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures,\" the company wrote.\n\nSuperintelligence refers to a theoretical form of advanced AI that is smarter than the human brain. However, a number of AI experts including Canadian AI pioneers like Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the threats that advanced AI systems could pose to humanity.\n\nRELATED: Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio warn \"risk of extinction from AI\" in public letter\n\nSutskever's former company OpenAI recently formed an internal team focused on governing potential superintelligent AI systems. However, TechCrunch reported in May that team members alleged they were not given the adequate compute resources to carry out their work.\n\nOpenAI has seen an exodus of employees who are known for their focus on AI safety in recent months. This group includes Sutskever, who left his role in May, Jan Leike, who was responsible for the development of ChatGPT and GPT-4, among other systems, and Daniel Kokotajlo, who recently told Vox he had \"lost trust\" in OpenAI leadership and the company's ability to handle the safety risks of AI.\n\nSutskever's last few months at OpenAI were contentious. Multiple outlets have reported he initially supported the board's ouster of CEO Sam Altman late last year, but later supported Altman's return to the top role.\n\nIn its statement today, SSI said it is positioning itself as a safety-first organization, noting it wants to \"advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\"", "source": {"uri": "betakit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BetaKit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabelle_kirkwood@betakit.com", "name": "Isabelle Kirkwood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geoffrey Hinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Krizhevsky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Krizhevsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AlexNet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Toronto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshua Bengio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/data-artificial-intelligence-stock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Sutskever almost forced Altman out of his AI startup back then.\n\nNow he has joined forces with OpenAI colleague Daniel Levy and Daniel Gross, a previous AI leader at Apple, to launch Safe Superintelligence Inc (SSI). This name clearly reflects the company's core objective: developing safe and beneficial artificial intelligence.\n\nThe newly formed company, Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), isn't mincing words about its mission. \"SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap,\" declared the founders, Ilya Sutskever, Daniel Levy, and Daniel Gross, in a statement on their website. They believe building safe superintelligence is \"the most important technical problem of our time.\"\n\nHere's why it's a big deal: Experts predict that machines won't stop getting smarter once they reach a human-level intelligence known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This hypothetical future stage, called Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), is what worries Sutskever and his team. Their company aims to ensure this superintelligence is developed safely and ethically.\n\nSutskever's focus on safe superintelligence isn't new. Leading computer scientists like Geoffrey Hinton have voiced concerns that ASI could pose an existential threat to humanity. In fact, ensuring safeguards that benefit humanity was a core mission for Sutskever during his time at OpenAI.\n\nHis departure from OpenAI in May was quite dramatic.

Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI, who left the company earlier this spring, is back in action with a new startup, Safe Superintelligence (SSI). Daniel Gross, former AI lead at Apple, and researcher Daniel Levy are co-founders of the company.\n\nSutskever is a well-respected and revered researcher who was part of Geoffrey Hinton's core research group and also at Google. His exit from OpenAI was closely followed. Bloomberg, which first reported the news, is scant on details about the what and how of the company. What does \"safe\" mean when it comes to superintelligence? Sutskever cryptically explains:\n\n\"By safe, we mean safe like nuclear safety as opposed to safe as in 'trust and safety.'\"\n\nOn SSI's company website, the three co-founders write:\n\nWe approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace. Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\n\nI have read fewer words, with more clarity.\n\nYou might remember Ilya as a key player in the OpenAI board-led ouster of Sam Altman as chief executive officer. Later, he reversed course, faded into the background, and eventually left OpenAI. He wasn't quite thrilled with the direction of OpenAI, which is looking to scrap its egalitarian roots for a more capitalistic model. The new startup seems to correct some of the sins of OpenAI, that is if you read between the lines.\n\n\"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then. It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.\"\n\nSutskever, in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nThis positioning is interesting and curious, though I agree that \"super intelligence\" isn't a business opportunity.

But at the highest level, this is OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever's new company:\n\nNow Sutskever is introducing that project, a venture called Safe Superintelligence Inc. aiming to create a safe, powerful artificial intelligence system within a pure research organization that has no near-term intention of selling AI products or services. In other words, he's attempting to continue his work without many of the distractions that rivals such as OpenAI, Google and Anthropic face. \"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then,\" Sutskever says in an exclusive interview about his plans. \"It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.\"\n\nI'm reminded of Coca-Cola Classic. That is, the branding the soda company had to go with after the 'New Coke' debacle in the 1980s to let everyone know that the original product they knew and loved was back. 'Safe Superintelligence' sounds a lot like 'OpenAI Original'. Ashlee Vance, who got the scoop on the new initiative, seems to agree:\n\nSafe Superintelligence is in some ways a throwback to the original OpenAI concept: a research organization trying to build an artificial general intelligence that could equal and perhaps surpass humans on many tasks. But OpenAI's structure evolved as the need to raise vast sums of money for computing power became evident. This led to the company's tight partnership with Microsoft Corp. and contributed to its push to make revenue-generating products. All of the major AI players face a version of the same conundrum, needing to pay for ever-expanding computational demands as AI models continue to grow in size at exponential rates.\n\nAs everyone is well aware at this point, Sutskever was part of the attempted coup at OpenAI as one of the board members that ousted CEO Sam Altman. But then in the truly bizarre days that followed, he apparently changed his mind - or was convinced to change his mind - and welcomed Altman back. Though interestingly, Sutskever, unlike Altman, was not welcomed back to the board after the fiasco. And all-the-right-things-said\u2122 aside, he was basically nowhere to be found within the company. And soon he was no longer found at all within the company.\n\nUpon leaving, again, despite all-the-right-things-said\u2122, it was a fairly awkward departure where he was stated to be going to work on something he was truly passionate about. This seemed to make it intentionally sound like he wasn't going to be working in the AI field any longer. And certainly not on something that competes with OpenAI. But of course he was going to work in AI, this is the space where he's arguably the best in the world at what he does. You don't just give that up and walk away. Certainly not right now! And certainly not if you're a true believer in the need for all of this to be done safely, as Sutskever clearly is!\n\nAnd so I guess you could argue that the new company isn't technically competing with OpenAI, but only because the Safe Superintelligence team presumably believes that OpenAI is clearly not doing what they aim to do from a safety perspective. They were perhaps doing that at one point with Sutskever and his co-founder and also former OpenAI colleague Daniel Levy, but now the focus is elsewhere. Perhaps still towards the goal of AGI, which this new company clearly wants to brand as \"Superintelligence\", but more from a product-perspective.\n\nSafe Superintelligence makes their mandate pretty clear on their spartan website:\n\nOur singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\n\nIn other words, if anything, OpenAI should perhaps be called 'Unsafe Superintelligence', from their vantage point.\n\nAnd just like that we have an exciting new chaotic wrinkle in the AI space, yet again. I'm not sure we've reached the limit of companies aiming for the same basic thing in slightly different ways, but surely we must be close to it. Right? Right?! The good news, I guess, is that all of these startups will push one another. The completely unknown news is... towards what, exactly?\n\nI can't wait to hear how Elon Musk is going to try to stir this stew. Presumably, he'll be um, aligned with Safe Superintelligence more than OpenAI, the company he also co-founded with Sutskever and Altman, but was also effectively ousted from and was until very recently suing for straying from their original goals. So yes, he's clearly not going to side with OpenAI, but may side with 'OpenAI Original', as it were. But, of course, he has his own play here now with xAI which he might deem to be the one true 'OpenAI Original'.\n\nAnd what must Microsoft think of all this? An OpenAI co-founder now founding another AI company that is not OpenAI. But maybe they're fine with that given that this co-founder was the key cog that led to the shitshow they had to step in to fix. And clearly, Sutskever was going to be a pain to them as they kept going down the commercialization path. But they may now be going down that path with or without OpenAI anyway. And OpenAI is sort of going down that path with Apple. It's all very Microsoft org-chart.\n\nAlso as Vance points out:\n\nSutskever has two co-founders. One is investor and former Apple Inc. AI lead Daniel Gross, who's gained attention by backing a number of high-profile AI startups, including Keen Technologies. (Started by John Carmack, the famed coder, video game pioneer and recent virtual-reality guru at Meta Platforms Inc., Keen is trying to develop an artificial general intelligence based on unconventional programming techniques.)\n\nGross is arguably the most active investor in AI at the moment. Maybe other than Altman. Or Microsoft. The race is officially on to scale \"no conflict, no interest\".\n\nThis fascination with Sutskever's plans only grew after the drama at OpenAI late last year. He still declines to say much about it. Asked about his relationship with Altman, Sutskever says only that \"it's good,\" and he says Altman knows about the new venture \"in broad strokes.\" Of his experience over the last several months he adds, \"It's very strange. It's very strange. I don't know if I can give a much better answer than that.\"\n\n\"It's very strange.

While announcing his departure from the AI startup, Sutskever indicated that after a decade at the company, he was leaving to focus on a project that was \"personally meaningful.\"\n\nDetails about the personally meaningful project remained a mystery until now. Sutskever disclosed he is starting a new company dubbed Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI). The company will mainly focus on building safe superintelligence, which remains a critical issue in the new age of AI.\n\nAccording to Sutskever:\n\n\"We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product. We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.\n\nWe approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\n\nOur singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nOpenAI has been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons, mostly. It's no secret that OpenAI and Sam Altman aim for superintelligence, but at what cost? Jan Leike, former Head of alignment, super alignment lead, and executive also left the OpenAI around the same period as Sutskever.\n\nLeike indicated that he left the company after having multiple disagreements with top executives over its core priorities on next-gen models, security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and more.\n\nWhile Leike joined the company with the thought that it was the best place in the world to research, it seemingly turned a blind eye to safety processes and culture to prioritize the development of shiny products. \"Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor,\" Leike added. \"OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity.\"\n\nPredictions indicate AI might be smarter than humans by the end of 2026, while other reports state that the technology will eventually take over all jobs and render work a hobby. What happens if we have technology that is smarter than humans? Could this potentially mean it might spiral out of control and take over humanity and the world?\n\nWhether AI is a fad remains debatable, but one thing is certain. It's rapidly growing and being widely adopted across the world. Even NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang says we might be on the verge of reaching the next phase of AI with self-driving cars and humanoid robots at the forefront.\n\nIf Sutskever and Safe Superintelligence Inc. can deliver safe superintelligence, it could give OpenAI a run for its money.

In an OpenAI blog post published in 2023, Sutskever worked with Jan Leike to discuss the potential for AI systems to become much smarter than humans.\n\nAs Sutskever and Leike point out, we don't have a solution for controlling a potentially superintelligent AI. Right now, our best technique for aligning AI is reinforcement learning from human feedback. Although this works for current deployments, it relies on humans directly supervising the AI.\n\n\"But humans won't be able to reliably supervise AI systems much smarter than us, and so our current alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence,\" the blog post stated. \"We need new scientific and technical breakthroughs.\"\n\nWhile this blog post went on to discuss certain actions OpenAI wants to take, Sutskever's departure from the company makes it clear that he wants to do more with SSI. The company's website points out that working toward safe superintelligent AI is SSI's \"singular focus\" which \"means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles.\"\n\nThe website goes on to mention that the company is working to attract the world's best engineers and researchers who will focus on SSI and \"nothing else.\"\n\nAt the moment, Sutskever and SSI are light on details concerning exactly how they will achieve SSI. Sutskever gave an interview to Bloomberg on his new venture, and he mentioned that the new venture will hope to bring about SSI by engineering safety protocols within the AI system itself, rather than tacking on guardrails after initial development.\n\nThat said, he seems to have a specific vision in mind for the direction he wants this technology to move.\n\n\"By safe, we mean safe like nuclear safety as opposed to safe as in 'trust and safety,'\" Sutskever said to Bloomberg.\n\nWhile we don't know much about what SSI will be in the near future, it's clear that Sutskever and the other founders have a singular devotion to safely implementing superintelligent AI tools.

This move comes just a month after he left OpenAI, signalling a significant shift in his focus towards AI safety.\n\nA Mission for Safe Superintelligence\n\nSafe Superintelligence (SSI) was born from Sutskever's commitment to addressing what he calls the \"most important technical problem of our time\" - creating a safe superintelligence. According to SSI's official X account, the company's mission is to ensure that superintelligent AI is developed with a primary focus on safety.\n\nPrioritizing Safety\n\nSutskever's departure from OpenAI was largely due to his growing concerns over the rapid pace at which AI technology was advancing under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman. Known for his outspoken stance, Sutskever even led efforts to remove Altman from the board of directors late last year. This internal conflict highlighted broader concerns about the potential dangers of unchecked AI development.\n\nIn response, Sutskever's new venture, Safe Superintelligence, aims to tackle these issues head-on. As stated on SSI's X account, the company's entire mission, name, and product roadmap revolve around the concept of safe superintelligence. \"SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\" the company emphasized.\n\nSSI plans to approach the development of AI by balancing safety and capability advancements. \"We approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace,\" the company added.\n\nThe Impact on OpenAI\n\nSutskever's entry into the AI arena with SSI naturally sets up a potential rivalry with OpenAI. However, OpenAI holds a significant advantage with its years of experience and established products like GPT-4. Additionally, OpenAI's strategic partnerships with companies such as Apple position it well for continued growth and innovation.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Sutskever emphasized that SSI's primary focus will be achieving safe superintelligence, even if it means delaying the release of mass-market products. This cautious approach underscores his commitment to safety, suggesting that it may be some time before SSI brings any major products to market.\n\nAs the AI landscape continues to evolve, Sutskever's new venture could play a crucial role in shaping the future of safe AI development. Whether SSI will emerge as a serious competitor to OpenAI remains to be seen, but its focus on safety sets it apart in the rapidly advancing world of artificial intelligence.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/06/20/1455876-iiya-sutskever.avif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

(SSI). The new company's goal and product are evident from its name.\n\nSSI is a United States company with offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. It will advance artificial intelligence (AI) by developing safety and capabilities in tandem, the trio of founders said in an online announcement on June 19. They added:\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nSutskever and Jan Leike were the leaders of OpenAI's Superalignment team created in July 2023 to consider how to \"steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\" Such systems are referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI allotted 20% of its computing power to the Superalignment team at the time of its creation.\n\nLeike also left OpenAI in May and is now the head of a team at Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic. OpenAI defended its safety-related precautions in a long X post by company president Greg Brockman but dissolved the Superalignment team after the May departure of its researchers.\n\nThe former OpenAI researchers are among many scientists concerned about the future direction of AI.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Butertin called AGI \"risky\" in the midst of the staff turnover at OpenAI.\n\nHe added, however, that \"such models are also much lower in terms of doom risk than both corporate megalomania and militaries.\"\n\n\"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then,\" Sutskever says in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg about his plans.\n\n\"It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, once an OpenAI supporter, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak were among more than 2,600 tech leaders and researchers who urged that the training of AI systems be paused for six months while humanity pondered the \"profound risk\" they represented.\n\nMusk replied to a post on X that highlighted the potential for this all to go very wrong: \"...based on the naming conventions established by OpenAI and StabilityAI, this may be the most dangerous AI company yet...\"\n\nThe SSI announcement noted that the company is hiring engineers and researchers.\n\n[ZH: Finally, we have a simple question -

According to reports, Sutskever had not been seen during the company's daily operations for the past several months.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Sutskever's departure, Altman shared that the news was \"very sad\" and hailed the co-founder as \"one of the greatest minds of our generation\".\n\n\"This is very sad to me; Ilya is easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend,\" Altman wrote on X.\n\n\"His brilliance and vision are well known; his warmth and compassion are less well known but no less important,\" Altman added.\n\nGlobalData forecasts that the overall AI market will be worth $909bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual rate of 35% between 2022 and 2030.\n\nIn the GenAI space, revenues are expected to grow from $1.8bn in 2022, to $33bn in 2027, a CAGR of 80%.", "source": {"uri": "verdict.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Verdict"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kurt_robson@verdict.co.uk", "name": "Kurt Robson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Levy_(Canadian_actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Levy (Canadian actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1258459659-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 81, "textEnd": 88}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Building safe superintelligence, they went on to argue, was \"the most important technical problem of our time.\"\n\nArtificial superintelligence, or ASI, is believed to be the ultimate breakthrough in AI, since experts predict machines will not stop developing once they reach the kind of general-purpose intelligence know as AGI that is comparable to humans.\n\nLuminaries in the field like the computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton believe ASI to be an existential danger to mankind and building safeguards that align with our interest as a species was one of the top missions Sutskever had at OpenAI.\n\nHis high-profile departure in May came almost six months to the day after he joined independent board directors Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley and Adam D'Angelo in removing Altman as CEO against the will of chair Greg Brockman, who immediately resigned.\n\nThe spectacular coup, which Toner recently blamed on a pattern of deception by Altman, threatened to tear the company apart. Sutskever quickly expressed his regret and reversed his position, demanding Altman be reinstated to prevent the potential downfall of OpenAI.\n\nIn the aftermath, Toner and McCauley left the non-profit board, while Sutskever seemingly vanished from the public eye all the way up until he announced his departure last month.\n\nIn his resignation announcement, he implied he was voluntarily going to commit to a project \"very personally meaningful to me\" and promised to share details at a later unspecified date.\n\nHis departure nonetheless set in motion events that quickly revealed deep governance issues that appeared to confirm the board's initial suspicions.\n\nFirst, Sutskever's co-lead Jan Leike accused the company of breaking its promise to give their AI safety team 20% of its compute resources and resigned. Later it emerged employees at OpenAI were slapped with water-tight gag orders that forbade them from criticizing the company after they left, at the penalty of losing their vested shares.\n\nFinally, actress Scarlett Johansson -- who portrayed an AI chatbot in Spike Jonze's 2013 sci-fi film Her -- then sued the company claiming Altman effectively stolen her voice to use for their latest AI product. OpenAI refuted the claim but pledged to change the sound anyway out of respect for her wishes.\n\nThese instances suggested OpenAI had abandoned its original purpose of developing AI that would benefit all of humanity -- instead to pursue commercial success.\n\n\"The people interested in safety like Ilya Sutskever wanted significant resources to be spent on safety, people interested in profits like Sam Altman didn't,\" Hinton told Bloomberg last week.\n\nSutskever has long been one of the brightest minds in the field of AI, researching artificial neural networks that conceptually mimic the human brain in order to train computers to learn and abstract based on data.\n\nIn 2012, he teamed up with Hinton to collaborate on the 2012 landmark development of Alex Krizhevsky's deep neural network AlexNet, commonly considered AI's Big Bang moment. It was the first machine learning algorithm that could accurately label images fed to it, revolutionizing the field of computer vision.\n\nWhen OpenAI was founded in December 2015, Sutskever received top billing over co-chairs Altman and Elon Musk even though he was only research director. That made sense at the time, as it was formed originally as a non-profit that would create value for everyone rather than shareholders, prioritizing \"a good outcome for all over its own self-interest\".\n\nSince then, however, OpenAI has effectively become a commercial enterprise, in Altman's words 'to pay the bills' for its compute-heavy operations. In the process it adopted a complicated structure with a new for-profit entity where returns were capped for investors like Microsoft and Khosla Ventures, but control remained with the non-profit board.\n\nAltman called this convoluted governance necessary at the time in order to keep everyone on board. Recently The Information reported he sought to change OpenAI's legal structure, opening the door for a controversial IPO.\n\nSutskever's new commercial enterprise dedicated to safe superintelligence will be located in Silicon Valley's Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, Israel, in order to best recruit top talent.\n\n\"Our team, investors and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\" they wrote, pledging there would be \"no distraction by management overhead or product cycles\".\n\nHow he and his two co-founders aim to both create ASI endowed with robust guardrails while also paying the bills and earning a return for their investors was not immediately clear from the statement, however. Whether it too has a capped for-profit structure, for example, was not revealed.\n\nThey merely said only that the business model of Safe Superintelligence was designed from the outset to be \"insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christiaan_hetzner@fortune.com", "name":

This isn't a kill switch, and it's just a soft pact to abide by some ethical standards in model development,\" Camden Swita, head of AI and machine learning innovation at AI firm New Relic,, told PYMNTS.\n\n\"Tech companies have made these kinds of agreements before (related to AI and other things like social media), so this feels like nothing new,\" Swita added.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_Murati", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mira Murati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kill switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-artificial-intelligence-Safe-Superintelligence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

However, as AI systems become more advanced, worries about their safety and possible dangers have also increased. This concern is now the main focus of a new startup created by AI experts who used to work at OpenAI, one of the top AI research companies.\n\nSafe Superintelligence, Inc. (SSI) was launched on June 19th by Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist at OpenAI, along with Daniel Levy, a former OpenAI engineer, and Daniel Gross, an investor and ex-partner at the prestigious startup accelerator Y Combinator. Their mission? To develop artificial intelligence that is not only extraordinarily capable but also provably safe and aligned with human values.\n\nThe founders stated their \"singular focus\" will be advancing AI safety and capabilities hand-in-hand, insulated from short-term business pressures. With offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, SSI aims to attract top engineers and researchers dedicated to tackling this monumental challenge.\n\nSutskever and Levy left OpenAI in May due to disagreements and changes within the company following Sam Altman's temporary dismissal as CEO. They were part of the \"Superalignment\" team formed in 2022 to tackle the challenge of managing superintelligent AI systems much smarter than humans, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nWhen Superalignment leads, including Jan Leike who moved to Anthropic, left OpenAI, the special safety team was disbanded. Despite this, OpenAI stays focused on developing AI responsibly through different efforts.\n\nMany influential people are worried about the future of super-intelligent AI. Vitalik Buterin, who helped create Ethereum, thinks that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is risky, but he believes that the bigger dangers come from companies being too ambitious and the military using AI for their purposes.\n\nElon Musk and Steve Wozniak from Apple, along with more than 2,600 others, have signed a letter asking for a six-month break in training advanced AI. They want this break so that we can carefully think about and understand the risks involved.\n\nYet the race among tech giants and startups to push AI boundaries continues rapidly. While companies like Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic tout responsible development, critics argue profit motives could compromise safety considerations for transformative but unpredictable technology.\n\nThis situation shows how important it is to have organizations like SSI that are fully committed to ensuring AI safety in the lead. As Sutskever and Levy pointed out, being free from commercial distractions allows these organizations to focus completely on making sure highly advanced AI systems align with human values and societal welfare.\n\nOf course, tackling the big challenge of AI safety is a huge technical obstacle. Just figuring out clear goals and measures is a tricky philosophical issue that hasn't been settled yet. However, the SSI founders strongly think that the risks are so serious that AI safety should be the most important thing as the field moves ahead.\n\nWhile excitement builds over AI's potential to help humanity, a growing group also warns we must remain watchful about the risks. As Musk said, \"We're simply the least intelligent species there has ever been.\" The launch of SSI represents a high-profile initiative to ensure we don't create something smarter than us that leads to unexpected - and potentially disastrous - consequences.", "source": {"uri": "coingabbar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coin Gabbar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "coin_gabbar@coingabbar.com", "name": "Coin Gabbar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitalik Buterin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Wozniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://d3iuzwoiyg9qa8.cloudfront.net/webadmin/storage/public/crypto-news/thumbnail/mWpg34qzUIHRvIefQkw02zjNTmzzGUenpxl2AoMu.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 534, "textEnd": 543}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Sutskever has made several major contributions to the field of deep learning. He is notably the co-inventor, with Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton, of AlexNet, a convolutional neural network. From November to December 2012, Sutskever spent about two months as a postdoc with Andrew Ng at Stanford University. He then returned to the University of Toronto and joined Hinton's new research company DNNResearch, a spinoff of Hinton's research group. Four months later, in March 2013, Google acquired DNNResearch and hired Sutskever as a research scientist at Google Brain.\n\nAt Google Brain, Sutskever worked with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Viet Le to create the sequence-to-sequence learning algorithm, and worked on TensorFlow. He is also one of the many co-authors of the AlphaGo paper.\n\nAt the end of 2015, he left Google to become cofounder and chief scientist of the newly founded organization OpenAI. He was personally recruited by Elon Musk into OpenAI. Tesla Inc. CEO and xAI founder Elon Musk held former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever in such high regard that he broke his friendship with Alphabet co-founder Larry Page over it.\n\nSutskever is considered to have played a key role in the development of ChatGPT.\n\nHe has now been funded with a new company that will create Safe Superintelligence.\n\nHe claims he does not need to partner with a multi-trillion dollar company. He will clearly get tens of billions to buy the Nvidia hardware to develop Artificial Superintelligence. There is big money that is willing to make that bet on Ilya.\n\nThe safety of the ASI will be engineered on top of a system that will have core values like liberty and freedom.\n\nIlya likely is well positioned and well informed to determine that Superintelligence is achievable and he likely has a clear plan for doing it. The questions are when will he do it? Will it be ahead of OpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon and Tesla/XAI, Anthropic, Chinese AI companies ?\n\nMost of the major AI teams seem to have gotten to OpenAI GPT4-level AI systems within about one year of the leader.\n\nIf all of the teams get there within a year of each other then what will that mean?\n\nIf all major AI teams make huge AI advances then it will be a world with robotaxi, advanced humanoid robots and superintelligence and increasing amounts of AI.\n\nIf the superintelligence comes from the same large language model based approach then it does seem like any one team can form a large lead and create a sustainable gap in capability.\n\nIf Ilya is still building upon the neural network foundation that he has been advancing then it means all teams will get to superintelligence. His insight seems to be related to a foundation that includes safety values engineered at the start.\n\nThe other gap AI companies can create is in areas where their business models creates sustainable data and manufacturing advantages.

That's my note to the well-intentioned Ilya Sutskever, formerly OpenAI's Chief Scientist and cofounder and now launching his own artificial intelligence firm with an eponymous goal and name: Safe Superintelligence.\n\nWhile Sutskever isn't a household name like OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, he is widely recognized as the guy who may have \"solved\" superintelligence late last year, a breakthrough that sparked a meltdown at the ChatGPT parent and led to the sudden - but not long-lived - ouster of Altman.\n\nAfter Altman returned, there were reports that the Super AI, or General AI intelligence breakthrough, something that could quickly lead to AI intelligence outstripping above-average human intelligence, had so freaked out the OpenAI board and Sutskever that they sought to put the brakes on the whole thing. Altman was likely not on board with that, so out he went until cooler heads prevailed.\n\nBy May of this year, Sutskever announced he was leaving OpenAI, news that arrived just days after the company unveiled the eerily powerful GPT-4o (you remember, the one that appears to abscond with Scarlett Johannson's voice?). At the time, Altman expressed sadness at his partner's departure and Sutskever would only say he was working on a project \"meaningful to him.\" No one thought he was about to start throwing clay and selling pottery.\n\nThe new company, announced on both X (formerly Twitter) and on a new, spare website, is that passion project in full. It's a direct response to what clearly left Ilya shaken at OpenAI. On the site, Sutskever explains, Safe Superintelligence \"is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI.\"\n\nTo achieve this goal, the company will pursue super intelligence and safety in tandem, with an emphasis, it seems, on the former.\n\nI suspect Sutskever is not much of a pop culture fan, movie, or even necessarily sci-fi aficionado. Otherwise, how could he or any of his team avoid snickering when saying the company name out loud? He could be forgiven for missing 2020's poorly-reviewed comedy Superintelligence in which, according to IMDB, \"...an all-powerful Superintelligence chooses to study average Carol Peters, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. As the A.I. decides to enslave, save or destroy humanity, it's up to Carol to prove that people are worth saving.\"\n\nWhile the movie got an abysmal 5.4 rating, it's not alone in dire predictions of humans versus superintelligence. The term has been around for well over a decade and while few would deny its potential, it's never had the full sheen of hope and promise. I stumbled on a 2014 book by Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. Note that \"Dangers\" gets a plumb second billing. The book description ponders, \"Superintelligence asks the questions: What happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence? Will artificial agents save or destroy us?\"\n\nThere is scarcely a TV show or movie that sees superintelligent AI differently. When artificial intelligence is smarter than us, all bets are off. It's the free-floating anxiety of culture, letters, and everyone I know.\n\nNot a day goes by now when I do not have a conversation about AI. It's not just at work where you'd expect it. It's with my wife and adult children. It's at parties and TV shoots. A mixture of excitement and dread is common. No one knows exactly where it's going and most share a simmering fear that AI will outstrip human intelligence and doom first our careers and then us all. They don't know the term \"superintelligence\" but the concept is crystal clear in their minds. It's not just about AI that's smarter than us, it's the potential of superintelligence living in all the devices we carry in our pockets and use on our desktops.\n\nThis week, dozens of new laptops arrived with Microsoft's Copilot+ baked deep inside the silicon. It is not, to be clear, anything approaching superintelligence. In fact, the demos I saw present a quite narrow viewport through which to view AI's true system-level potential. But as someone noted to me yesterday, if all these AIs get smarter and become aware of each other and of us, especially our foibles, what's to say they don't just take control of those systems and our lives?\n\nAs someone who covers all this, I can tell you with some certainty that's not going to happen, at least not in my lifetime.\n\nEven so, I once thought general AI or superintelligence might arrive when I'm a doddering old fool. Now, I predict 18 months.\n\nThat's why I find Sutskever's company name almost comical. The pace of AI development is moving at an exponential pace. Imagine soapbox racing downhill, brakeless, and with a driver who only understands how 80% of the controls work, you get the idea.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"Safe Superintelligence.\" Responsible Superintelligence is possible and, if I'd been in the room when Sutskever and his team were naming his company I would've suggested it. Ultimately, that's all any of these AI companies can promise, acting in responsible and, perhaps, humane ways. That may lead to \"safer\" superintelligence, but full safety is illusory at best.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_ulanoff@techradar.com", "name": "Lance Ulanoff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_scientific_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief scientific officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bostrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwC594VTwZ6QZA7LSJFzSh-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead,\" notes the SSI website, adding that \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nInterestingly, safety is a concern only a few frontier AI labs have. In recent history, OpenAI's safety team got the spotlight for being neglected, and the company's safety lead, Jan Leike, publically criticized safety practices before moving to Anthophic. Antrophic is focused on providing safe AI models, with its Claude Opus being one of the leading AI models to date. What is to come out of SSI? We still don't know. However, given the team of Ilya Sutskever, Daniel Gross, and Daniel Levy, we assume they attracted the best-in-class talent for developing next-generation AI models, focusing on safety. With offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, SSI can tap a vast network of AI researchers and policymakers to establish safe ASI, free from short-term commercial pressure and focused on research and development. \"Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\" says the SSI website.", "source": {"uri": "techpowerup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechPowerUp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gross_(journalist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gross (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Colleges and Universities", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.techpowerup.com/img/iYFThoKFfqrLfgBE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

However, AI is not just limited to chatbots. AI agents, AGI, and Superintelligence are the next paradigms of the AI era we are about to witness. So in this article, I explain what is Superintelligence and how Safe Superintelligence can protect mankind from powerful AI systems.\n\nAs the name suggests, Superintelligence is a form of intelligence that far surpasses the brightest and most ingenious human minds in every domain out there. It possesses knowledge, skills, and creativity, an order of magnitude higher than biological humans.\n\nKeep in mind that Superintelligence is a hypothetical concept where AI systems gain superior cognitive abilities, beyond human capabilities. It can unlock new paradigms in scientific discovery, solve problems that have challenged human minds for centuries, think and reason much faster than humans, and perform actions in parallel.\n\nIt's often said that Superintelligence will be even more capable than AGI -- Artificial General Intelligence. David Chalmers, a cognitive scientist, says that AGI will gradually lead to superintelligence. An AGI system can match the abilities of humans in reasoning, learning, and understanding. However, Superintelligence can go beyond that and exceeds human intelligence in all aspects.\n\nIn May 2023, OpenAI shared its vision of superintelligence and how it can be governed in the future. The blog written by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever, states that \"it's conceivable that within the next ten years, AI systems will exceed expert skill level in most domains, and carry out as much productive activity as one of today's largest corporations.\"\n\nSince Superintelligence can surpass human capabilities, there are many risks associated with this technology. Nick Bostrom, a prominent thinker argues that there is an existential risk to humanity if Superintelligence is not aligned with human values and interests. It can lead to unimaginable outcomes for human society, possibly leading to human extinction.\n\nApart from that, Bostrom also raises questions about ethical issues regarding the creation and use of superintelligent systems. What will happen to the rights of the individual, who is going to control it, and what will be the impact on society and welfare? Once such a system is developed, there is a high chance that it can evade human attempts to control or limit its actions.\n\nNot just that, Superalignment can lead to an \"Intelligence Explosion\", a term coined by the British mathematician I.J. Good in 1965. He theorized that a self-improving intelligent system can design and create even more powerful intelligent systems leading to an intelligence explosion. In such a scenario, unintended consequences may follow which can be harmful to mankind.\n\nMany AI theorists have argued that taming and controlling a superintelligent system will require rigorous alignment with human values. Such a system must be aligned in a way that it interprets and performs actions correctly and responsibly.\n\nIlya Sutskever, the co-founder of OpenAI and former co-lead of the Superalignment project at the company, set out to work on aligning powerful AI systems. However, in May 2024, Sutskever left OpenAI along with Jan Leike, the superalignment head working at the company.\n\nLeike alleged that \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\" He has now joined Anthropic, a rival AI lab. Sutskever, on the other hand, has announced a new company called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) that aims to create a safe superintelligent system. SSI says that it's \"the most important technical problem of our time.\"\n\nLed by Sutskever, the company wants to solely work on achieving safe superintelligence, without having to engage with management or product cycles. While working at OpenAI, Sutskever gave an interview to The Guardian where he emphasized the potential risks and benefits of powerful AI systems.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arjun_sha@beebom.com", "name": "Arjun Sha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bostrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discovery (observation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global catastrophic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Chalmers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human extinction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I.

He was one of the board members to fire Sam Altman earlier this year before resigning himself when Altman returned.\n\nThat is what he hopes to continue with his new company SSI Inc. This is the first AI lab to skip artificial general intelligence (AGI) and go straight for the sci-fi-inspired super brain. \"Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\" the company wrote on X.\n\nThe founders are Sutskever, Daniel Gross, a former Apple AI lead turned investor in AI products and Daniel Levy a former OpenAI optimization lead and expert in AI privacy.\n\nArtificial superintelligence (ASI) is AI with beyond human levels of intelligence. \"At the most fundamental level, this superintelligent AI has cutting-edge cognitive functions and highly developed thinking skills more advanced than any human,\" according to IBM.\n\nUnlike AGI, which is generally as or more intelligent than humans, ASI would need to be significantly more intelligent in all areas including reasoning and cognition.\n\nThere is no strict definition of superintelligence and each company approaching advanced AI has different interpretations. There is also disagreement over how long it will take to achieve this level of technology with some experts predicting decades.\n\nOne aspect of superintelligence would be an AI capable of improving its own intelligence and capabilities, leading to even further distance between human and AI capabilities.\n\nThe problem with creating an AI model more intelligent than humanity is it could be difficult to keep it controlled or stop it from outsmarting us. It could opt to destroy humanity if it isn't properly aligned to human values and interests.\n\nTo solve this every company working on advanced AI is also developing alignment techniques. These are approaches vary from systems that work on top of the AI model and others that are trained alongside it. That is the SSI Inc approach.\n\nSSI says that focusing exclusively on superintelligence will allow them to ensure it is developed alongside alignment and safety. \"SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus,\" they wrote on X.\n\n\"We approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs,\" the company added. \"We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\"", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_morrison@tomsguide.com", "name": "Ryan Morrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drBf8ViFzmWAwNB2oCMgsa-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

He joins a growing list of Big Tech employees leaving to start their own AI startups, many of whom became disillusioned with the tech giants' promises on user privacy and safety.\n\nSutskever's new company is called Safe Superintelligence, whose \"singular focus\" is on a safe AI space. This means \"no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures,\" he said in a post.\n\nStarting from scratch\n\nSutskever's exit also threw up questions as it came a day after the company announced the launch of a new AI model called GPT-4o, capable of realistic voice conversation and able to interact across texts and images. In November, Sutskever was one of several OpenAI board members who moved to fire Altman, a decision that touched off a whirlwind five days at the company.\n\nJan Leike, who ran the Superalignment team at OpenAI, also resigned, saying that safety was no longer a priority for the company, but only \"shiny new products\".\n\n\"I joined because I thought OpenAI would be the best place in the world to do this research. However, I have been disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company's core priorities for quite some time, until we finally reached a breaking point,\" he said in a post.\n\nFor Leike, Sutskever's exit was the last straw following disagreements with the company, a source told Reuters.\n\nLeike joined Anthropic, an AI startup founded by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, former OpenAI employees who sought a more safety-focussed approach to the viral technology. The founders were unhappy with Microsoft's investment in the company, saying that such a deal would make the company's products too commercialised, and safety would take a backseat.\n\nThis is in line with current and former employees at OpenAI writing an open letter earlier this month, voicing their concerns about the AI industry's fast advancement without oversight.\n\nOpenAI also effectively dissolved a team focused on ensuring the safety of possible future ultra-capable AI systems, following the departure of the group's two leaders, Sutskever and Leike.\n\nBranching out of Google\n\nGoogle has seen multiple such exits by developers whose AI products were getting delayed due to internal bureaucracy and a slow translation of research into products.\n\nMistral AI, another company founded in 2023 which builds open source and commercial AI models, was created by former researchers at Google Deepmind and Meta.\n\nUncharted Labs, a new generative AI startup, was founded by three Google Deepmind researchers David Ding, Charlie Nash, and Yaroslav Ganin, known for their work in AI-generated music and images. It was reported that their decision to leave the tech giant was due to red tape and the Deepmind merger.\n\nTokyo-based Sakana AI is another startup founded by two prominent former Google researchers David Ha and Llion Jones. The latter is a co-author on Google's 2017 research paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", which introduced the \"transformer\" deep learning architecture that formed the basis for viral chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nDevelopers of Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA), Noam Shazeer, and Daniel De Freitas, went on to found Character AI, a neural language model chatbot service that can generate human-like text responses and participate in contextual conversation.\n\nAnother example is ElevenLabs, a voice AI research and deployment company, aiming to make content universally accessible.

To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.)\n\nFormer OpenAI chief scientist forms new AI company\n\nOpenAI's co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has announced that he will be starting a new AI company. Titled Safe Superintelligence, the firm will be focused on AI safety with offices based out of Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. In a post on X, Sutskever said that their focus from safety will not be distracted by management or product cycles or competitive pressures from the ongoing AI race in the tech industry.\n\nFormer OpenAI researcher, Daniel Levy and co-founder of Cue, Daniel Gross along with a former AI lead at Apple are listed as co-founders of the AI firm besides Sutskever. The AI researcher left OpenAI after being a major part of CEO Sam Altman's firing last year. Sutskever was later removed from the company board after Altman's return.\n\nStudents refuse to work at Google, Amazon\n\nMore than 1,100 STEM students and young workers from across 120 universities have signed a pledge to not take job offers or internships from Google or Amazon unless they stop being a part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract that offers cloud computing services and infrastructure to the Israeli government.\n\nThe students are from colleges like Stanford, UC Berkeley, University of San Francisco and San Francisco State University and also participated in a rally outside the Google office in SF with other workers and activists. These companies are the top employers for graduate students from these STEM schools according to LinkedIn data. Google had earlier clarified that Project Nimbus wasn't for military work but leaked documents have showed that the contract is for Israeli military.\n\nNew GST regime harmful for skill based gaming industry\n\nThe new GST regime has been either harmful to the revenue of skill based online gaming companies or been turned their business model non-functional, a study by the Ernst & Young and the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum stated. After the changes in the EST structure, the pay-to-play online skill gaming industry has to pay 28% on deposits.\n\nSince the new tax regime was introduced, no capital has been raised in the sector since 1st October 2023 with some companies reporting a complete withdrawal of global investors, the report added. The Indian gaming sector has attracted $2.6 billion in FDI since 2019 from both domestic and global investors with 90% going to the pay-to-play format.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri":

We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product,\" Sutskever said via X (formerly Twitter).\n\nSSI is co-founded by Daniel Gross, who previously led AI efforts at Apple, and Daniel Levy, a former member of the technical staff at OpenAI.\n\nThe startup's mission is to create an AI system that prioritizes safety over commercial pressures.\n\n\"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures,\" SSI said, in a post on X.\n\nGuzman y Gomez was Australia's 'best' IPO for years\n\nGuzman y Gomez (ASX:GYG), a Sydney-based Mexican restaurant chain, made a soaring stock market debut down-under, marking Australia's 'best' IPO for around three years.\n\nThe stock gained over 39% on its first day of dealing, hitting A$30.28 at one point and finishing trading day at $30.\n\nIts IPO previously priced the new shares at $22 each, raising A$200 million for the themed restaurant firm to expand internationally.\n\nThe company operates more than 200 Guzman y Gomez fast-food outlets across Australia, Singapore, Japan, and the United States.\n\n\"We're on a mission to reinvent fast food for the better, changing the way the masses eat one burrito at a time,\" co-chief executive Steven marks says on the company's investor website.\n\n\"Who said fast food has to be bad food!\"\n\nNvidia chips are precious commodities in \"fourth industrial revolution\" - analyst\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is being hailed as the AI economy's new precious commodity, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, who rates the semiconductor firm at 'outperform.'\n\nIves described Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang as \"the godfather of AI,\" noting that Nvidia has recently become the world's most valuable company, surpassing both Apple and Microsoft. These tech giants are now vying to be the first $4 trillion company, driven by the growth in AI.\n\n\"Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway,\" Ives said in a note.\n\nIves also addressed concerns about valuations, stating, \"While the bears will continue to harp on valuations of Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, MongoDB, ServiceNow, and other AI pure plays, we believe investors that have missed the biggest transformational tech stocks the last decade including Amazon, Netflix, Meta, Apple, Alphabet among many others have dogmatically stuck with the forward PE valuation approach on these unique tech stories.\"\n\nHe predicts a substantial increase in AI-driven spending, estimating an incremental $1 trillion over the next decade.\n\nDr Martens outlook is uncertain says analyst\n\nDr Martens PLC (LSE:DOCS) stock market rating is currently uncertain, according to analysts at Barclays.\n\nThe boot maker's direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales channel visibility, particularly in the United States, is seen as crucial for determining its financial outlook.\n\nA recent trading update from Dr. Martens did little to clarify the company's prospects for the remainder of the year. Barclays analyst Richard Taylor highlighted that while some retail market indicators are moderately encouraging, the demand in the U.S. is a critical factor.\n\n\"We believe there are a wide range of potential outcomes for financial performance, and believe that observing D2C trends, especially any signs of improvement in the US, will be critical to judge whether a recovery can be achieved, or whether forecasts are still too optimistic,\" Taylor noted in a report.\n\nIn late May, Dr. Martens warned investors about its sales, which it described as \"very second-half weighted.\" Taylor's analysis on the day of the company's results for the 2024 financial year, released on 30 May, described the numbers as \"expectedly poor.\" He also pointed out the ongoing weak consumer demand in the United States as a significant factor.\n\n\"Given the revenue decline, the company note that FY25 will be 'very second-half weighted, particularly from a profit perspective', and we assume a loss before tax in H1 of \u00a326 million, before a rebound to PBT of \u00a347 million in H2 FY25, vs \u00a350 million in H2 FY24,\" Taylor stated.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk",

Augmedix has designed its software specifically for the noisy, chaotic environment of hospital emergency rooms.\n\nStethoscopes, thermometers, and cardiac monitoring machines are go-to technologies in hospital emergency departments -- and now you can add generative AI to the list.\n\nAugmedix, a San Francisco-based company that provides AI-powered medical documentation tools, today announced a partnership with Emergency Services Inc. that will bring a version of the company's technology created specifically for the chaos of the emergency room environment to seven Ohio facilities and over 50 doctors. Using proprietary LLMs as well as Google Cloud's MedLM's suite of medically tuned models, Augmedix Go ED is designed to capture conversations between physicians and ER patients via Bluetooth and draft medical notes almost instantaneously. The technology will take over a task previously performed by emergency room doctors as they rushed between patients and, hopefully, curb the administrative overload that's causing them to quit.\n\n\"Clinician burnout is at a record high. The administrative overload that plagues doctors is staggering,\" said Eric Drobny, MD, FACEP, CFO of Emergency Services Inc., explaining the problem the medical services group hopes to solve by integrating the technology. According to the 2023 Medscape Physician Burnout and Depression Report, physicians in emergency medicine reported the highest rate of burnout (65%) of all doctors, with most citing bureaucratic demands as the primary cause for burnout. Recent years have also seen a significant drop in applications for previously competitive ER positions.\n\nOther tools for ambient medical documentation exist, including from Augmedix. Abridge, founded by practicing cardiologist Shiv Rao and valued at $850 million in its last funding round in February, is focused on using generative AI to compose medical notes too. It has signed up a number of major health care systems as customers and now integrates with Epic, one of the major electronic medical record software vendors. Microsoft owns medical scribe software provider Nuance, which is also competing in this space.\n\nBut the emergency room environment has unique challenges that some other available solutions aren't designed to meet. \"We cannot use just any documentation solution,\" Drobny said, adding that the medical provider has tried out several different approaches -- from human scribes to AI scribes that don't specialize in the emergency departments -- in search of a solution, only to run into challenges with each.\n\n\"To address the unique and complex needs of the emergency department, documentation solutions need to effectively capture notes amid a significant amount of background noise. Additionally, patient conversations are often complex and involve disparate, nonlinear interactions with multiple clinicians. These challenges do not exist when a patient schedules a regular office visit with their doctor,\" Manny Krakaris, CEO of Augmedix, told Eye on AI.\n\nAugmedix Go ED was released in April and underwent a pilot program with HCA Healthcare, which is also expanding the use of the technology following the pilot, according to Augmedix. While the public is still unclear on the benefits of many of the most buzzy AI models, a technology that can lessen the burden on doctors, allowing them to spend more time -- and cognitive power -- on patient care, has obvious advantages. Augmedix Go, a related product focused on ambulatory care settings, saves up to one hour or more per clinic day, according to Augmedix, which shared the data with Eye on AI but said the study is not yet available online.\n\nOf course, this use of AI is also extremely high-stakes. There's no margin for error in life-or-death situations. Additionally, medical facilities deal with some of the most sensitive PII (personally identifiable information) and thus have additional responsibility and strict security and governance requirements for their data. Krakaris said Augmedix is HIPAA compliant and is committed to adopting the most rigorous measures to protect patient data.\n\nGenerative AI is still very new, and there are a lot of kinks to work out. Still, Drobny believes \"the benefits of Augmedix Go ED will largely outweigh everything else\" and deliver accurate medical notes faster than the doctors ever could.\n\nOpenAI cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever launches a new AI lab. Called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), the company says it has one singular goal and product, \"a safe superintelligence,\" and that it's set up to be \"insulated from short-term commercial pressures,\" according to its website. He told Bloomberg the company will not do anything else until meeting that goal and declined to disclose its financial backers or the amount raised. In addition to Sutskever, SSI is also cofounded by Daniel Levy, another former technical staff member of OpenAI, and Daniel Gross, a former AI lead at Apple who has become a prominent investor in AI startups.\n\nThe vision described for SSI sounds similar to the origins of OpenAI -- before it linked up with Microsoft for cash and compute and started commercializing products. Sutskever, who developed key AI advances as a university researcher and then worked as a scientist at Google before joining OpenAI, was a major figure in the effort to oust CEO Sam Atman last year. He resigned from OpenAI in May, followed days later by his co-lead on the superalignment team, Jan Leike, who publicly criticized the company for prioritizing \"shiny products\" over safety. SSI isn't the first AI company to be started by former OpenAI employees who left over safety concerns -- it's the founding story of rival Anthropic as well (where Leike has since taken on a role leading up a similar-sounding superalignment team focused on long-term AI risks).\n\nNvidia passes Microsoft's market cap to become the world's most valuable public company. The chipmaker on Tuesday climbed to a $3.34 trillion valuation, eclipsing Microsoft's $3.32 trillion. It was just two weeks ago that the company stole the number two spot from Apple. Nvidia maintains around 80% market share for AI chips and data centers and has seen its share price rise 170% this year, according to CNBC.\n\nLeading AI chatbots are spreading Russian propaganda. That's according to Axios. NewsGuard, an organization that works to combat misinformation, tested 10 AI tools by entering 57 prompts asking about narratives known to be disinformation (specifically, narratives created by American fugitive John Mark Dougan, who the New York Times reports creates and spreads misinformation from Moscow). Across OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, You.com's Smart Assistant, Grok, Inflection, Mistral, Microsoft's Copilot, Meta AI, Anthropic's Claude, Google Gemini, and Perplexity, NewGuard found that the chatbots often presented false information as fact and spread Russian disinformation narratives 32% of the time.\n\nAnthropic's rivalry with OpenAI rivalry heats up with its claim new Claude AI surpasses GPT-4o -- by Sharon Goldman\n\nAI boom means Europe's universities are becoming the new Harvard and Stanford for finding tech talent -- by Ryan Hogg\n\nMicrosoft's U.K. CEO says the tech giant actually has more vacancies on LinkedIn than it did before the AI boom -- by Ryan Hogg\n\nThat's around how many inbound requests Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue said he's receiving every week from AI startup founders who are looking to be acquired. \"This year, in particular, it has increased quite a lot,\" he told Bloomberg. Hugging Face, which was valued at $4.5 billion last August, made its fourth acquisition last week: Argilla, a collaboration platform for AI engineers, which it bought for $10 million.\n\nThe rising interest in selling AI startups likely represents founders looking to strike while the market is hot. At the same time, there's a lot of competition (not to mention uphill battles) in the very crowded AI space -- a rush to sell could also feed fears the hype bubble is about to pop. AI startups not affiliated with deep-pocked Big Tech companies have been struggling to raise enough money to pay for the compute needed to build ever-more powerful models", "source": {"uri":

In a statement, some policymakers on the bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voiced worries that some underlying measures of inflation, such as in the services sector, remain elevated, which could be stoked further if interest rates are cut too soon. The decision, which was widely anticipated by economists, is likely to disappoint the governing Conservative Party ahead of the U.K.'s general election in two weeks time.\n\nFrance's Macron, African leaders push for vaccines for Africa after COVID-19 exposed inequalities\n\nPARIS (AP) -- French President Emmanuel Macron is joining African leaders to kick off a planned $1 billion project to accelerate the rollout of vaccines in Africa. The effort comes after the coronavirus pandemic exposed gaping inequalities in access to vaccines globally. The African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator will provide financial incentives to vaccine manufacturers. Many African leaders and advocacy groups say Africa was unfairly locked out of access to COVID-19 treatment tools, vaccines and testing equipment when the pandemic swept the globe starting in 2020.\n\nOpenAI founder Sutskever sets up new AI company devoted to \"safe superintelligence\"\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) -- One of the founders of OpenAI who was involved in a failed effort to push out CEO Sam Altman says he's starting a safety-focused artificial intelligence company. Ilya Sutskever, a respected AI researcher who left the ChatGPT maker last month, said in a social media post on Wednesday that he's setting up Safe Superintelligence Inc. with two co-founders. The company's only goal and focus is safely developing \"superintelligence\" - a reference to AI systems that are smarter than humans. The company vowed not to be distracted by \"management overhead or product cycles,\" and under its business model, work on safety, security, and progress would be \"insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\n\nStock market today: Global stocks are mixed as central banks hold off on rate cuts\n\nHONG KONG (AP) -- European markets have opened higher after a mixed day of trading in Asia. Trading was thin after U.S. markets were closed in observance of Juneteenth. The Bank of England was expected to keep its main interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% at a policy meeting Thursday. China's central bank kept its key interest rates unchanged and the yuan was trading at its lowest level this year. Indonesia's central bank also kept its benchmark rate steady, at 6.25%. Ahead of Wall Street's reopening, the future for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed while that for the S&P 500 rose 0.4%.\n\nSnapchat Inc. to pay $15 million to settle discrimination and harassment lawsuit in California\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Snapchat Inc. will pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by California's civil rights agency. The California Civil Rights Department accused the company of discriminating against female employees, failing to prevent workplace sexual harassment and retaliating against women who complained. The department announced Wednesday that the settlement covers women who worked for the company in California between 2014 and 2024. It is subject to court approval. The bulk of the settlement will pay compensation to employees who faced discrimination at the company. The company says it disagrees with the agency's claims but that it decided to settle to avoid costly and lengthy litigation.\n\nEU envoys agree on more Russia sanctions. LNG imports are among the targets.\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) -- European Union envoys have reached agreement on a \"powerful and substantial\" new series of sanctions that are part of its ongoing response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The EU's Belgian presidency posted on social media on Thursday that the package provides new targeted measures and maximizes the impact of existing sanctions by closing loopholes. The measures will notably target imports of Russian liquid natural gas and make it harder to move around. The EU estimates that about 4 billion-6 billion cubic meters (141 billion-212 billion cubic feet) of Russian LNG was shipped on to third countries via EU ports last year. Details about the sanctions are likely to be released early next week if EU foreign ministers endorse them as expected on Monday.\n\nOpenAI founder Sutskever sets up new AI company devoted to \"safe superintelligence\"\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) -- One of the founders of OpenAI who was involved in a failed effort to push out CEO Sam Altman says he's starting a safety-focused artificial intelligence company.

President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva -- who nominated Chambriard -- attended the ceremony Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro. Chambriard said Petrobras management was fully aligned with Lula's vision for the country. Fears of government intervention date to the sprawling \"Car Wash\" investigation that discovered billions of dollars in kickbacks related to construction contracts Petrobras awarded. Car Wash's prosecutions of scores of politicians and executives were celebrated at the time as great achievements against impunity but have been steadily dismantled.\n\nCanadian airline WestJet begins canceling flights as mechanics threaten to strike\n\nCanadian airline WestJet is starting to cancel some flights as it braces for a possible strike this week by aircraft maintenance technicians. The airline said Wednesday that it expects to cancel about 40 flights between Tuesday and Wednesday, affecting 6,500 passengers. The airline says it is canceling the flights to avoid leaving passengers and planes stranded in remote locations if there is a walkout. The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association has said that it intends to strike as soon as Thursday night after rejecting a WestJet contract offer. WestJet is hoping that the Canadian Industrial Relations Board will force both sides into binding arbitration.\n\nA Missouri mayor says a fight over jobs is back on. Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, says an economic 'border war' between his state and Kansas has restarted. Mayor Quinton Lucas blames a plan approved by the Kansas Legislature that's aimed at luring his city's two major-league sports franchises from Missouri. It would allow Kansas to issue bonds to help pay for new stadiums for the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals. In the past, the two states used subsidies to pull businesses across the border that runs through the Kansas City metropolitan area but their governors signed a truce in 2019. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said it doesn't apply to professional sports.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Powerhouse", "body": "Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, its creator, OpenAI, has quickly become a household name. In the past 18 months, the company's astronomical rise in valuation has paralleled its booming headcount. In January 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated it was operating with 375 employees. LinkedIn currently puts the employee count at over 2,000.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime.\n\nSee all of our newsletters\n\nOpenAI was founded in December 2015 by Altman along with three other co-founders: Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and Elon Musk. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel and corporate investors, including Amazon and Infosys, were early backers who helped the company start research and operations with $1 billion in funding.\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI split into the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary called OpenAI Global, LLC. The OpenAI we know today operates by a capped-profit model, which sets a maximum limit on the profit investors can retrieve from their investments. (In early June, it was reported that OpenAI is considering shifting from a capped-profit model to an entirely for-profit one.) Meanwhile, the nonprofit arm allows it to take on costly long-term research projects.\n\nOpenAI has seen significant leadership changes in recent years as its business soared, most notably Altman's abrupt firing and reinstatement in November 2023 and the ensuing board overhaul. OpenAI's former board of directors included Altman, Musk (who left in early 2018), Sutskever and several non-founding investors and A.I. experts. Today, the company is governed by an entirely new board, consisting of seven members from various backgrounds in tech, policy and academia.\n\nHere are the nine notable executives and seven board directors running OpenAI: Sam Altman, 39, CEO\n\nAltman became the CEO of OpenAI's for-profit entity when it was created in 2019. He was briefly fired in November 2023 only to be reinstated days later after over 95 percent of OpenAI employees signed an open letter demanding his return.\n\nAltman dropped out of Stanford University at 19 and co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile app that he successfully sold. He joined the startup accelerator Y Combinator as a partner in 2011 -- initially working part-time to balance co-founding the venture capital firm Hydrazine Capital with his brother, Jack Altman -- and was promoted to president in 2014. He was forced to resign from Y Combinator in 2019 for spending too much time on non-company projects, including OpenAI.\n\nOutside of OpenAI, Altman is also the chairman of clean energy companies Oklo Inc. and Helion Energy. Altman's involvement in outside business endeavors was reportedly one of the reasons OpenAI's former board wanted to push him out.\n\nGreg Brockman, 36, president and chairman\n\nGreg Brockman co-founded OpenAI and has led the company's research and engineering efforts, including product development. Brockman was fired along with Altman in November 2023 and returned shortly after Altman's reinstatement. Previously, he was the chief technology officer of Stripe, the fintech company led by Jack Dorsey.\n\nMira Murati, 35, chief technology officer\n\nMira Murati began working at OpenAI in June 2018 as vice president of applied A.I. and partnerships. She was later promoted to senior vice president of research, product and partnerships and CTO in 2022.\n\nMurati has a blended background in business and engineering. Prior to joining OpenAI, she was a senior product manager at Tesla, focusing on its Model X vehicle. Before that, she worked as an engineer at the aerospace company Zodiac Aerospace and was vice president of product and engineering at virtual and augmented reality development company Leap Motion (which later merged with Ultrahaptics to become Unleap).\n\nJakub Pachocki, 33, chief scientist\n\nSince OpenAI works toward both research and A.I. products, the company has a chief scientist and a chief technology officer. The chief scientist focuses on research, while the CTO focuses on application and product development.\n\nJakub Pachocki became chief scientist after his predecessor Sutskever resigned in May 2024. Formerly OpenAI's director of research, the Polish scientist led the development of GPT-4 and OpenAI Five. Pachocki joined OpenAI in early 2017 after completing his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University and serving as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. He has been commended for contributing to OpenAI's research in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning optimization research.\n\nSarah Friar, 51, CFO\n\nOne of the newest additions to OpenAI's C-suite, Sarah Friar joined the company in June 2024 as its first CFO. Friar most recently served as the CEO of Nextdoor, a neighborhood-based social networking app. Before that, she was a banker at Goldman Sachs and worked for Salesforce and Square between 2012 and 2018. Friar is on the board of ConsenSys, a blockchain company, and previously sat on Slack and New Relic boards.\n\nJason Kwon, 46 to 48, chief strategy officer\n\nJason Kwon became chief strategy officer in July 2023 after serving as OpenAI's general counsel for a little over two years. He oversees the company's strategy, particularly investments, and shapes its direction concerning its growing competition. Kwon has an extensive legal background, having served as general counsel for Y Combinator, where he focused on the YC Continuity Fund, as assistant general counsel for Khosla Ventures and as an associate for the Goodwin global law firm.\n\nChe Chang, general counsel\n\nAmidst the several legal battles facing OpenAI, it's no surprise that the company boasts a growing in-house legal team. Che Chang brings his legal expertise in tech from his previous position as a senior corporate counsel for Amazon. Chang is the lead attorney on OpenAI's in-house team, providing legal advice and guidance for the company, from mitigating risks and ensuring legal compliance to serving as its official legal representation in court.\n\nHannah Wong, 39 or 40, communication chief\n\nHannah Wong joined OpenAI in February 2021, leaving a seven-year public relations stint at Apple. She became OpenAI's head of public relations and later vice president in 2023. Wong began her career at Edelman, a global communications firm, working primarily on Xbox and Xbox LIVE, Charles Schwab and Twitter accounts.\n\nAfter a short time freelancing in corporate communications at Gap, she eventually worked as Apple's PR manager -- and then senior manager -- mainly focusing on the iPad, Apple Pay, Apple Card, and iCloud. At OpenAI, she leads the communication strategy and PR and oversees employee communications and brand design teams.\n\nAlissa Rosenthal, 40, head of sales\n\nAlissa Rosenthal began her career in tech at S&P Global and served as the director of strategic partnerships at A.I.-powered market intelligence at Quid. She started her first sales job at Mixpanel as sales director, then at InVisionApp Inc., before\n\nBefore joining OpenAI in June 2022, Alissa Rosenthal was most recently vice president of sales at the SaaS company WalkMe. In an interview with VentureBeat in February, Rosenthal revealed that she currently manages a 150-person team. She describes the primary purpose of the sales team as aiding users in transitioning into artificial generative intelligence (AGI), although AGI remains undefined industry-wide.\n\nCurrent board members Adam D'Angelo, 39, co-founder and CEO of Quora Bret Taylor, 43, co-founder of Sierra, an A.I. startup Lawrence Summers, 69, former National Economic Council Director under former President Barack Obama Sue Desmond-Hellmann, 66, Pfizer board member and former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Nicole Seligman, 67, former executive vice president and general counsel of Sony Corporation and former president of Sony Corporation of America Fidji Simo, 38, CEO of Instacart and co-founder of the Metrodora Institute Paul M.

(SSI), a new artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on creating a safe and powerful AI system, marking another evolution from OpenAI's roots.\n\nTo understand Ilya Sutskever's new venture, consider the goals of OpenAI, the company he co-founded in 2015. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), a system that can rival human abilities. Their mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity, not just a select few.\n\nOpenAI comprises two entities: the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. and its for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Global, LLC. The organization has been at the forefront of the ongoing AI boom, developing several technologies, including advanced image generation models like DALL\u00b7E and the AI-enabled chatbot ChatGPT, and is often credited with sparking the current AI frenzy.\n\nOpenAI was founded by a group of prominent AI researchers and entrepreneurs, including Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata and Wojciech Zaremba. Sam Altman and Elon Musk served as the initial board of directors members.\n\nOpenAI has received significant investments from Microsoft, totaling $11 billion as of 2023. These investments have allowed the organization to pursue its ambitious research goals and develop AI technology.\n\nDespite its success, OpenAI has faced criticism for its shift toward a more commercial focus, with some experts arguing that the organization has strayed from its original mission of developing safe and beneficial AGI.\n\nThis criticism has been fueled by the recent leadership changes at OpenAI, which saw Altman removed as CEO and Brockman resigning as president before both returned after negotiations with the board. The board now includes former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chairman and retired U.S. Army general and National Security Agency (NSA) head Paul Nakasone as a member, with Microsoft also obtaining a non-voting board seat.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sutskever has launched SSI, which he claims will approach safety and capabilities in tandem, allowing the company to advance its AI system while prioritizing safety. The announcement emphasized the company's commitment to avoiding distractions from management overhead or product cycles, which often pressure AI teams at companies like OpenAI, Google and Microsoft.\n\n\"Our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures,\" the announcement said. \"This way, we can scale in peace.\"\n\nThe launch of the new company follows a turbulent period at OpenAI. In late 2023, Sutskever was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to remove CEO Sam Altman from his position. By May, Sutskever decided to leave the company entirely.\n\nSutskever's exit is part of a broader trend. Shortly after his departure, two other notable OpenAI employees -- AI researcher Jan Leike and policy researcher Gretchen Krueger -- also announced their resignations. Both cited concerns that OpenAI was prioritizing product development over safety considerations.\n\nThese departures have sparked discussions within the AI community about balancing rapid technological advancement and responsible development practices. Many interpret Sutskever's decision to start SSI as a response to what he perceives as a shift in OpenAI's focus.\n\nAs OpenAI continues to forge partnerships with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, SSI is taking a different approach, focusing solely on developing safe superintelligence without the pressure of commercial interests.\n\nThis has reignited the debate over the possibility of achieving such a feat, with some experts questioning the feasibility of creating a superintelligent AI, given the current limitations of AI systems and the challenges in ensuring its safety.\n\nCritics of the superintelligence goal point to the current limitations of AI systems, which, despite their impressive capabilities, still struggle with tasks that require common sense reasoning and contextual understanding. They argue that the leap from narrow AI, which excels at specific tasks, to a general intelligence that surpasses human capabilities across all domains is not merely a matter of increasing computational power or data.\n\nAdditionally, even among those who believe in the possibility of superintelligence, there are concerns about ensuring its safety. The development of a superintelligent AI would require advanced technical capabilities and a deep understanding of ethics, values and the potential consequences of such a system's actions. Additionally, skeptics argue that the challenges involved in creating a safe superintelligence may be insurmountable given our current understanding of AI and its limitations.\n\nAs the AI landscape continues to evolve, the debate over the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence is likely to intensify. While the goal of creating a safe and beneficial superintelligent AI remains a distant and controversial prospect, the work of researchers like Sutskever and his colleagues at SSI will likely shape the future of this rapidly advancing field, just as OpenAI's achievements have done in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Blackwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Livingston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonsense reasoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/OpenAI-SSI-Safe-Superintelligence-AI.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665836", "eventUri": "eng-9665836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 456619598, "relevance": 2}

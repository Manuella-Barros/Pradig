It was perfect! Very comfy material, and can be dressed up or down or pieces can be separated. I wore the top and bottom to dinner and drinks with heels and then changed into comfy shoes and some black pants to walk the strip in the late evening. I got it in black too. I want more colors! Definitely try this set out.\" \u2014Chris & Lauren Get it from Amazon for $43.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and in 17 colors).", "summary": "<h1>We love no-fuss outfit equations.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/18/15/asset/7ec579129003/sub-buzz-676-1718725056-1.jpg?crop=1026:684;0,359\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/anamariaglavan/gorgeous-matching-sets-that-take-the-guesswork-out-of\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/anamariaglavan/gorgeous-matching-sets-that-take-the-guesswork-out-of", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/20/20/campaign_images/4a673c19f55d/28-gorgeous-matching-sets-that-take-the-guesswork-3-1834-1718916421-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:31:02", "author": "Anamaria Glavan,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Anamaria Glavan", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.233}

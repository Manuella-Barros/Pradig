Kristi Noem returned to the Sunday talk shows after being ripped last month for shooting her dog, but unlike the ill-fated canine, the story just won\u2019t die. Ms. Noem once again defended the decision to include the dog-shooting incident in her book \u201cNo Going Back,\u201d telling CNN anchor Dana Bash in a testy Sunday interview that she was protecting her children from a dangerous animal. Asked if she had \u201cregrets\u201d about sharing the tale, Ms. Noem pushed back, saying \u201cThat story\u2019s the 20-year-old story of a mom who made a very difficult decision to protect her children from a vicious animal that was attacking livestock, and killing livestock, and attacking people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s in the book because it was difficult for me, and there\u2019s a lot in that book that I think people need to read,\u201d said Ms. Noem, a Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read it or not.\u201d Interjected Ms. Bash: \u201cI\u2019ve read the whole thing.\u201d Ms. Noem replied: \u201cOh, good, well, I\u2019m glad you did. Thank you for doing that,\u201d then pivoted to the 2024 presidential election. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot in that book that\u2019s very important,\u201d said the Republican governor. \u201cI hope people will read it because it\u2019s a how-to guide for the average citizen on how to get their government back and why I believe that we need to have President Trump back in the White House.\u201d \u2019We\u2019ve Covered This!\u2019 Kristi Noem Bristles at Dana Bash\u2019s Biting Questions About Dog-Gate in Tense CNN Interview https://t.co/gUlpUUgEfy \u2014 Mediaite (@Mediaite) June 9, 2024 Like a pup with a bone, however, Ms. Bash refused to drop the matter, saying, \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing is no regrets, not just about writing about it, but actually shooting the dog.\u201d Ms. Noem shot back with \u201cWe\u2019ve covered this.\u201d She then said that a 9-year-old South Dakota boy was recently killed by a dog. \u201cThat happens. And that 9-year-old boy will never be in his parents\u2019 lives again,\u201d Ms. Noem said. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be in his family\u2019s lives again. People are put in tough situations in life, and we learn from it.\u201d Ms. Bash asked: \u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve learned that challenging times and hard decisions are hard,\u201d the governor said. \u201cAnd that when you get into public office, you learn from every single one of them.\u201d \u201cAnd you use that knowledge to go forward and to make wise decisions that are best for America,\u201d Ms. Noem said before blasting President Biden. \u201cThat\u2019s why Joe Biden\u2019s such a train wreck,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guy\u2019s 80 years old and making the worst decisions I\u2019ve ever seen him make in his entire life and destroying our country.\u201d", "summary": "South Dakota Gov.

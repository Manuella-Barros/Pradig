They were eventually forced out of their Catholic school, Saint Francis High School. The students later sued the school.\n\nThe Santa Clara County jury reportedly sided with the ex-students on two of the five claims made in the lawsuit. They were awarded $500,000 each as well as $70,000 tuition reimbursements. This comes four years after the incident.\n\n\"Our primary goal was to clear (our clients') names,\" the plaintiffs' attorney, Krista Baughman, told the San Francisco Chronicle after the jury's decision on Monday. \"It was quite clear the jury believed these were innocent face masks. They are young kids, their internet trail is going to haunt them for the next 60 years. Now they don't have to worry about that.\"\n\nThe former students were identified as H.H. and A.H. Back in 2020, the boys and their parents filed a lawsuit against the school for $20 million after their photos, clicked in 2017, went viral and they were subsequently accused of doing blackface. The photos show the two plaintiffs, as well as a third boy who did not attend the same school, posing in front of a mirror wearing green face masks. The lawsuit claimed these were acne medications.\n\nThe photos were said to have re-emerged in 2020 in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, when they were shared in a chat group. Parents assumed they were making a racist joke, and allegedly pressured the school to act against them.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, the school gave the two boys an ultimatum due to public pressure. They were told they could either voluntarily withdraw, or be expelled. The plaintiffs were 14 at the time.\n\n\"Defendants took it upon themselves to use the innocent and wholly unrelated photograph of the boys to make the malicious and utterly false accusation that the boys had been engaging in 'blackface,' and to recklessly assert that the photograph was 'another example' of racism at SFHS,\" the suit states.\n\n\"The boys did not use the facemasks or take the photograph with any ill-intent, bias or prejudice, let alone in connection with any racist sentiments or epithets,\" it adds.\n\nThe jury eventually found the school guilty of two of the five claims made in the suit. These included failing to properly investigate and breach of an oral contract.\n\n\"We appreciate the jury's verdict rejecting the plaintiffs' two primary claims of defamation and breach of contract and thank them for their thoughtful analysis. The jury rightly found we did not breach our handbook, did not violate the students' free speech rights, and did not defame the students,\" a spokesperson from the school told Fox News Digital. \"However, we respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process and are exploring legal options, including appeal as there is no legal precedent applying that claim to a high school.\"\n\n\"We are grateful for the strong support of our community throughout this case,\" the statement added. \"We look forward to putting this matter behind us so we can return to focusing solely on educating our vibrant student body and living the Catholic values of the Holy Cross tradition, which are rooted in hope, respect, integrity and family.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_High_School_(Mountain_View,_California)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Francis High School (Mountain View, California)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_the_Holy_Cross", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College of the Holy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/Court_1715244404206_1715244404610.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552536", "eventUri": "eng-9552536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Now they don't have to worry about that.'\n\nTwo California teens who were forced to withdraw from a prestigious Catholic high school over 'blackface' allegations were awarded $1 million and tuition reimbursement on Monday\n\nThe boys sued Saint Francis High School in August 2020 after photos circulated of them wearing acne treatment masks three years prior\n\nThe boys were accused of performing blackface and were ultimately pressured into withdrawing from the prestigious Mountain View school\n\nThe teens lost on three other claims alleging breach of contract, defamation and a violation of free speech.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially sought $20 million when they filed suit in Santa Clara County Superior Court, three years after they and a friend - who attended another school and was not included in the lawsuit - snapped a selfie while donning acne treatment masks.\n\nIn the offending photo, the boys' faces were covered in dark green medication. A photo taken a day earlier revealed that they had tried on white face masks as well.\n\nAccording to documents reviewed by DailyMail.com, another SFHS student obtained a copy of the photograph from a friend's Spotify account and uploaded it to a group chat in June 2020.\n\nThe photo resurfaced on the same day recent SFHS graduates created a meme pertaining to the murder of George Floyd, which sparked its own outrage and controversy.\n\nThe student insinuated that the teens were using 'blackface' and deemed the photo 'another example' of racist SFHS students, before urging everyone in the group chat to spread it throughout the school community.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, Dean of Students Ray Hisatake called the boys' parents to ask them if they were aware of the photograph.\n\nThe parents asserted that the teens had applied green facemasks three years earlier, 'with neither ill intent nor racist motivation, nor even knowledge of what \"blackface\" meant,' according to the suit.\n\nThe offending photo resurfaced on the same day recent SFHS graduates created a meme pertaining to the murder of George Floyd, sparking its own deal of outrage\n\nPrincipal Katie Teekell told one of the boys' parents that he could choose to 'voluntarily' withdraw, and any mentions of disciplinary action would be scrubbed from his record - but she later went back on her promise\n\nLess than four business hours later, Principal Katie Teekell called H.H's parents and said the teen was 'not welcomed back to SFHS.'\n\nWhen the boy's father reiterated that his son had not engaged in blackface, Teekell responded that her decision was not based on 'intent,' but 'optics' and 'the harm done to the St. Francis community'.\n\nTeekell said H.H. could choose to 'voluntarily' withdraw, rather than be expelled, with the incident scrubbed from his student record.\n\n'At no time did Ms. Teekell, or anyone else from the SFHS administration, offer to investigate the allegations against the boys, or assist in removing the Photograph in any way,' the lawsuit asserts.\n\nBy June 17 the school's attorney was telling the families the image's 'disrespect was so severe as to warrant immediate dismissal'.\n\nThe school then backed a protest by parents who used the image as evidence of 'kids participating in black face (sic) and thinking that this is all a joke,' according to a Facebook page.\n\nThe teens ultimately withdrew on June 19, but H.H. encountered a problem when he attempted to join the football team at his new school.\n\nDespite Teekell's promise, SFHS was required to disclose that he had switched schools to avoid disciplinary action. This would see him banned from playing sports for a year, per regional rules.\n\nRead More Two teenage boys sue exclusive Catholic school for $20 million claiming photo of them in 'blackface' which saw them 'forced out by leadership' was actually green acne medication\n\nThe lawsuit asserted that the principal's violation of her verbal agreement constituted a breach of oral contract.\n\nH.H. ultimately moved to Utah with his family in order to be eligible to play football during his senior year of high school.\n\nAs part of the jury award, SFHS must reimburse the teen's moving and living costs.\n\n'This lawsuit is our attempt to redeem our names and reputations, and to correct the record to reflect the truth of what actually happened,' the boys' families said in a joint statement at the time.\n\n'A photograph of this innocent event was plucked from obscurity and grossly mischaracterized during the height of nationwide social unrest.\n\nThey claimed SFHS and its leadership had 'rebuffed' their attempts to correct the misunderstanding and 'seemed to have no interest in entertaining the truth'.\n\nJudge Thang Barrett decided against dismissing the suit in January 2021, noting that there was no evidence of an investigation into the matter by administrators.\n\nAfter Monday's verdict, SFHS released its own statement.\n\nRepresentatives for the school said they 'respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process'.\n\nSFHS is now 'exploring legal options,' including an appeal.", "source":

This case is one of several demonstrating how progressive characteristics are becoming increasingly prevalent in many schools.\n\nThe lawsuit centered on Saint Francis High School, a private Catholic institution, whose leadership decided to expel two students for supposedly posting a picture on social media in which they wore blackface. The problem? The kids were not actually wearing blackface as the school claimed.\n\nA Santa Clara County jury has awarded $1 million and tuition reimbursement to two former students who sued an elite Catholic high school in Mountain View, saying administrators forced them out over an alleged blackface photo that actually showed teens masked in acne medication.\n\nThe jury sided with the plaintiffs on two claims against Saint Francis High School, for breach of oral contract and lack of due process, said Frank Hughes, the father of one of the students. However, Hughes said, he and the other plaintiffs lost on three other claims alleging breach of contract, defamation and a violation of free speech.\n\n\"Our primary goal was to clear (our clients)' names,\" the plaintiffs'' attorney, Krista Baughman, said in an interview after the jury award, which was handed down Monday. \"It was quite clear the jury believed these were innocent face masks. They are young kids, their Internet trail is going to haunt them for the next 60 years. Now they don't have to worry about that.\"\n\nThose representing the school said they \"respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process\" and indicated they might seek an appeal.\n\nThe incident occurred in August 2017 when a boy experiencing acne wore a mask.\n\nIn August 2017, a boy identified as A.H. in the lawsuit donned a green mask that his mother had purchased, intended to cure severe acne. He snapped a bathroom selfie with another boy in a white acne mask. The following day A.H., a friend referred to as H.H., and a third boy, Minor III, rubbed green medication on their faces in solidarity and took a picture of themselves, according to the lawsuit. Court exhibits show a photo of three shirtless boys, one flashing rock 'n roll horns.\n\nAlthough the students said they had taken the photos not out of racial animus but as a joke, it went viral amid a national reckoning over race and inequality. Some who viewed the photo believed it was clearly intended as a depiction of blackface. One parent shared the photo ahead of a planned march to protest \"outrageous behavior\" online and pressure the school to take action.\n\nHowever, the pictures were not discovered until 2020 amid the national controversy over the murder of George Floyd. Students and parents connected to the school argued that the boys were making a racist joke and applied public pressure to have them removed from the school.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the school of using \"the innocent and wholly unrelated photograph of the boys to make the malicious and utterly false accusation that the boys had been engaging in 'blackface,' and to recklessly assert that the photograph was 'another example' of racism at SFHS.\"\n\nThere have been multiple \"scandals\" involving blackface over recent years. In November, a Deadspin author attempted to smear a nine-year-old child for supposedly wearing blackface at a Kansas City Chiefs game. It was later revealed that the young boy was wearing the team's colors.\n\nThese incidents, as well as others, come against the backdrop of heightened racial tensions in America.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_High_School_(Mountain_View,_California)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Francis High School (Mountain View, California)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadspin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadspin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/rs/images/up/2024/47/e1431737-c6f5-467b-86ba-ed488f3b4171.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552536", "eventUri": "eng-9552536", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-", "textStart": 1935, "textEnd": 1946, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Why backlash? Because the green masks appeared to be blackface.\n\n\"Some who viewed the photo believed it was clearly intended as a depiction of blackface,\" the Chronicle notes. \"One parent shared the photo ahead of a planned march to protest 'outrageous behavior' online and pressure the school to take action.\"\n\nAs the criticism mounted, Saint Francis High School gave A.H. and N.H., the boys attending the school, the choice to withdraw voluntarily or be expelled.\n\n\"Tragically, defendants achieved their goal of portraying plaintiffs as poster children of racism at [Saint Francis High School], resulting in the devastating destruction of the boys' young lives,\" the boys' attorney wrote in their lawsuit.\n\nThe suit also accused the school of \"virtue signaling\" by rushing to punish them without first conducting a fair investigation.\n\nAfter the boys left Saint Francis, they tried to enroll at other schools, but the principal at Saint Francis promised he wouldn't reveal the reason for their ouster. There was just one problem, according to Frank Hughes, the father of one of the boys.\n\n\"Hughes' son played football and wanted to join the team at his new school, which required Saint Francis to disclose that he had switched schools to avoid a disciplinary action,\" according to the Chronicle. \"With that disclosure, the boy would be automatically banned from playing sports for a year, under a regional regulation for high school athletic programs.\"\n\n\"The principal's breach of a verbal agreement underpinned the plaintiffs' oral contract claim in the lawsuit. Hughes wound up moving his family to Utah so his son would be eligible to play football during his senior year,\" the Chronicle notes.\n\nLong story short, a Santa Clara County jury sided with the kids, awarding them $1 million in damages and tuition reimbursement.\n\n\"Our primary goal was to clear [our clients'] names,\" lead attorney Krista Baughman said after the ruling. \"It was quite clear the jury believed these were innocent face masks. They are young kids. Their internet trail is going to haunt them for the next 60 years. Now they don't have to worry about that.\"\n\n\"This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California, which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them. The jury rightly confirmed that Saint Francis High School's procedures were unfair to our clients and that the school is not above the law,\" she added.\n\nThe jury specifically ruled that Saint Francis High School had breached an oral contract and also violated the boys' due process rights. However, the jury rejected the boys' claims of breach of contract, defamation, and violation of free speech.\n\nThe school wasn't pleased with the overall ruling. In a statement, reps for the school said they \"respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process\" and that they're \"exploring legal options,\" including a potential appeal.\n\nThe only bad news is that the two boys and their parents had initially sought a whopping $20 million. Still, $1 million is better than nothing.\n\n\"We want to sincerely thank the jury and the court system for helping our boys and our families find justice, which now paves the way for their names to be cleared for things they never did,\" A.H.'s family said in a statement, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

A Santa Clara County jury sided with the teens, identified by the initials A.H. and H.H., on two claims concerning breach of oral contract and lack of due process. The boys sued Saint Francis High School in August 2020 after photos circulated of them sporting acne treatment masks.\n\nThe controversy started when the boys were accused of performing blackface and were ultimately pressured into withdrawing from the prestigious Mountain View school. 'It was quite clear the jury believed these were innocent face masks,' attorney Krista Baughman told the San Francisco Chronicle after Monday's judgement. 'They are young kids, their internet trail is going to haunt them for the next 60 years. Now they don't have to worry about that.' The teens lost on three other claims alleging breach of contract, defamation and a violation of free speech.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially sought $20 million when they filed suit in Santa Clara County Superior Court, three years after they and a friend - who attended another school and was not included in the lawsuit - snapped a selfie while donning acne treatment masks. In the offending photo, the boys' faces were covered in dark green medication. A photo taken a day earlier revealed that they had tried on white face masks as well. According to documents reviewed by DailyMail.com, another SFHS student obtained a copy of the photograph from a friend's Spotify account and uploaded it to a group chat in June 2020.\n\nThe photo resurfaced on the same day recent SFHS graduates created a meme pertaining to the murder of George Floyd, which sparked its own outrage and controversy. The student insinuated that the teens were using 'blackface' and deemed the photo 'another example' of racist SFHS students, before urging everyone in the group chat to spread it throughout the school community. On June 4, 2020, Dean of Students Ray Hisatake called the boys' parents to ask them if they were aware of the photograph. The parents asserted that the teens had applied green facemasks three years earlier, 'with neither ill intent nor racist motivation, nor even knowledge of what \"blackface\" meant,' according to the suit.\n\nLess than four business hours later, Principal Katie Teekell (pictured) called H.H's parents and said the teen was 'not welcomed back to SFHS.' When the boy's father reiterated that his son had not engaged in blackface, Teekell responded that her decision was not based on 'intent,' but 'optics' and 'the harm done to the St. Francis community'. Teekell said H.H. could choose to 'voluntarily' withdraw, rather than be expelled, with the incident scrubbed from his student record. 'At no time did Ms. Teekell, or anyone else from the SFHS administration, offer to investigate the allegations against the boys, or assist in removing the Photograph in any way,' the lawsuit asserts. By June 17 the school's attorney was telling the families the image's 'disrespect was so severe as to warrant immediate dismissal'.\n\nThe school then backed a protest by parents who used the image as evidence of 'kids participating in black face (sic) and thinking that this is all a joke,' according to a Facebook page. The teens ultimately withdrew on June 19, but H.H. encountered a problem when he attempted to join the football team at his new school. Despite Teekell's promise, SFHS was required to disclose that he had switched schools to avoid disciplinary action. This would see him banned from playing sports for a year, per regional rules. The lawsuit asserted that the principal's violation of her verbal agreement constituted a breach of oral contract. H.H. ultimately moved to Utah with his family in order to be eligible to play football during his senior year of high school. As part of the jury award, SFHS must reimburse the teen's moving and living costs.\n\n'This lawsuit is our attempt to redeem our names and reputations, and to correct the record to reflect the truth of what actually happened,' the boys' families said in a joint statement at the time. 'A photograph of this innocent event was plucked from obscurity and grossly mischaracterized during the height of nationwide social unrest. They claimed SFHS and its leadership had 'rebuffed' their attempts to correct the misunderstanding and 'seemed to have no interest in entertaining the truth'.\n\nJudge Thang Barrett decided against dismissing the suit in January 2021, noting that there was no evidence of an investigation into the matter by administrators. After Monday's verdict, SFHS released its own statement.\n\nRepresentatives for the school said they 'respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process'. SFHS is now 'exploring legal options,' including an appeal.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The image surfaced online in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and amid racial justice protests. The students were around 14 years old in the photo when it was taken.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that a jury in Santa Clara County agreed that Saint Francis High School administrators overstepped when issuing the expulsion, and failed to give the students a fair hearing before tossing them from the school.

However, we respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process and are exploring legal options, including appeal as there is no legal precedent applying that claim to a high school.

While the former students had lost on three of their five claims, the jury sided with them for the school's breach of oral contract and lack of due process, the outlet reported. (RELATED: Parents Sue School Board After School Suspends Student For Saying 'Illegal Aliens')\n\n\"This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California, which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them,\" partner at the Dhillon Law Group Krista Baughman stated in a press release. \"The jury rightly confirmed that St. Francis High School's procedures were unfair to our clients and that the school is not above the law.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by the SF Chronicle, stated that in August 2017 a boy who was identified as A.H. had worn a green acne facemask purchased by his mother and took a bathroom selfie with another boy who was wearing a white acne facemask. The next day, A.H., a friend identified as H.H., and a third boy labeled as Minor III, all put on the green acne facemask, taking a picture of themselves which was provided within the lawsuit.\n\nAs the photo of the boys went viral, they stated that it had been taken as a joke and not out of racial animosity, the outlet reported. However, claims circulated that the boys had taken the photo allegedly intending to portray blackface. Backlash against the school built, with one parent reportedly sharing the photo ahead of a planned march protesting the \"outrageous behavior\" online, according to the SF Chronicle.\n\nThe school administrators gave the students an option to either voluntarily withdraw or be expelled, and by 2020 the teens and their parents sued the school, initially seeking $20 million.\n\nFollowing the issue, A.H.'s father, Frank Hughes stated that after his son left Saint Francis and attempted to enroll in other schools, the principal allegedly promised to not disclose the reason behind their transfer. As A.H. was seeking to play football and was set to join his new school's team, Saint Francis was required to disclose that he had transferred to avoid disciplinary action. The information automatically banned him from playing sports for a year due to regional regulations for high school athletic programs, the SF Chronicle reported.\n\nWhile the boys' family thanked the jury in a statement, Saint Francis officials called out the dismissal of the plaintiff's primary legal claims regarding defamation and breach of contract, as well as finding that the administration had not interfered with the boys' rights to free speech, the SF Chronicle reported. In a statement given to the outlet by a school representative, they officials stated they \"respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process,\" claiming other \"legal options\" would be looked into.\n\n\"Twenty percent of our boys' lives have been spent seeing this process come to fruition. But the sacrifice is worth it to clear our boys' names, and to try and make sure that St. Francis can never again assume a child is guilty without giving a child the opportunity to show their innocence. To never again sacrifice any child to protect the school's reputation like they did our boys,\" the Hughes family stated in response to the verdict.\n\n\"Despite being afforded time to reflect and contemplate after the heat of the moment had subsided, President Jason Curtis and Principal Katie Teekell don't regret their actions. They would do the same thing today. We hope this will lead the Board of Directors to hold those responsible for these actions and make needed changes to protect students moving forward. And to restore the sanctity of St. Francis as a Holy Cross high school.\"\n\nSince A.H.'s ban from football for a year, he and his family moved to Utah so he would be able to play football for his senior year, according to the SF Chronicle. In addition to the award granted to the boys, the private school will be required to reimburse Hughes for moving and living expenses, the outlet reported.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_High_School_(Mountain_View,_California)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Francis High School (Mountain View, California)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis of Assisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_the_Holy_Cross", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College of the Holy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2015-12-16T120000Z_609235302_GF10000267924_RTRMADP_3_LOSANGELES-THREAT-scaled-e1715223962534.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552536", "eventUri": "eng-9552536", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-", "textStart": 1237, "textEnd": 1248}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Push back against Big Tech and media gatekeepers. Subscribe to Reclaim The Net.\n\nWith a verdict defending the rights of minors against premature judgment, two teenagers from California, formerly ousted from an illustrious Catholic high school for alleged \"blackface\" activities that went viral on social media, emerged victorious in court this week, receiving a $1 million reward and reimbursement for tuition fees.\n\nA jury from Santa Clara County backed the teenagers, known by their initials A.H. and H.H., about the issues of violated verbal agreements and denial of due process.\n\nThree years ago, the youngsters sued Saint Francis High School after photographs of them wearing acne treatment masks sparked a widespread controversy. Accusations of \"blackface\" performance led to their coerced withdrawal from the esteemed institution in Mountain View. \"It was quite clear the jury believed these were innocent face masks,\" affirmed Krista Baughman, the boys' attorney, speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle in the aftermath of Monday's judgment.\n\nDespite their landmark victory, the plaintiffs did not succeed on all fronts, losing out on three other allegations about contract breach, defamation, and impingement of free speech. When the lawsuit was initially filed at Santa Clara County Superior Court, the teenagers sought $20 million in damages, stemming from an incident three years prior when they and a friend - not involved in the legal case - posed for a selfie wearing acne treatment masks with a dark green hue.\n\nThis photo, innocuously depicting a skincare routine, was later repurposed as racist evidence against the students years later. A fellow student, who had procured a copy of the photograph from a friend's Spotify account, uploaded the image to a group chat in June 2020, amidst the global upsurge in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.\n\nThe photo surfaced coincidently with a meme posted by recent SFHS graduates commenting on the death of George Floyd, thereby creating its own share of backlash.\n\nBuilding on assumptions of \"blackface,\" the student went on to distribute the photo across the school community, portraying it as an example of the school's racist culture. The parents of the accused teens maintained that the green masks had been used with no malicious intent or racial bias; they claim their sons were unaware of the implications of \"blackface\" at the time.\n\nAs matters spiraled out of control, the school administration, instead of investigating, leaned towards the side of public sentiment. No assistance was offered by the SFHS administration in refuting these allegations or in containing the spread of the photograph. Instead, Principal Katie Teekell pressured H.H's parents into having him \"voluntarily\" withdraw from the school, ostensibly to avoid public humiliation. Yet, regardless of her assurances, the school was compelled to reveal H.H.'s previous actions, leaving him prohibited from participating in athletics for a year according to regional rules.\n\nThe court has decreed that SFHS must cover the teenager's relocation costs after he relocated with his family to Utah so he could continue playing football for his senior high school year.\n\nSFHS and its leadership had refused the families' multiple attempts to rectify the misunderstanding and flatly refused to entertain the truth, as alleged by the boys' families. Ultimately, Judge Thang Barrett opted not to dismiss this significant lawsuit in January 2021, acknowledging the school administrators' apparent lack of due process. The school maintains its dissent with the jury's findings and is currently examining potential legal recourse, which may include an appeal.\n\n\"We want to sincerely thank the jury and the court system for helping our boys and our families find justice, which now paves the way for their names to be cleared for things they never did,\" said a statement from the family of one of the boys, as supplied to Reclaim The Net. \"Because that's why we filed this lawsuit, and endured four years while it worked its way through the court system. Twenty percent of our boys' lives have been spent seeing this process come to fruition. But the sacrifice is worth it to clear our boys' names, and to try and make sure that St. Francis can never again assume a child is guilty without giving a child the opportunity to show their innocence. To never again sacrifice any child to protect the school's reputation like they did our boys.\"\n\nThis case creates new legal precedent by expanding the fair procedure rights established by the California Supreme Court in Boermeester v. Carry from private universities to private high schools, including religious ones. It ensures that students at these schools are given proper notice of charges and a fair chance to respond before disciplinary actions are enforced.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, this incident throws a spotlight on the broader societal conundrum of cancel culture and the perils of policy overreach. The tale of two California high schoolers mistakenly tagged as racists for wearing green acne masks is a stark illustration of how swiftly and harshly the online world can judge, often without all the facts.\n\nThe school's rush to placate public outrage without diligent inquiry into the matter is a clear-cut example of policies stretched too thin, motivated more by the fear of public shaming than by justice. Such knee-jerk decisions not only skip due process but also trample on fairness.", "source": {"uri": "reclaimthenet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reclaim The Net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_squires@reclaimthenet.org", "name": "Ben Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bface-kids-school-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552536", "eventUri": "eng-9552536", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 1838, "textEnd": 1847}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The plaintiffs said when his two friends saw him applying the cream, the two boys then followed suit in solidarity.\n\nIn court filings, the school's attorney says administrators disagreed with the families' explanation that the photo was innocent.\n\nWhile two of the boys' families say Saint Francis High mishandled the situation and are seeking damages for defamation and breach of contract, the school says it had \"sole discretion\" to punish the two students and that the families left voluntarily in June 2021.\n\nThe former students and their parents initially sought $20 million when they sued Saint Francis High in 2020, shortly after the photo surfaced online.\n\nAs criticism mounted, school administrators gave the boys a choice of voluntarily withdrawing or being expelled. The students withdrew.\n\n\"Tragically, defendants achieved their goal of portraying (the) plaintiffs as poster children of racism at (Saint Francis High School), resulting in the devastating destruction of the boys' young lives,\" attorneys for the Dhillon Law Group wrote in their court complaint, in which they accused the school of \"virtue signaling\" and rushing to punish the teens without a fair investigation.\n\nFollowing Monday's verdict, Saint Francis High must pay both students $500,000 each, as well as a little under $60,000 for tuition reimbursement, court filings said.\n\nConcord man elicits sex from minors, watches them 'overdose repeatedly,' prosecutors say\n\n\"The jury rightly found we did not breach our handbook, did not violate the students' free speech rights, and did not defame the students. However, we respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process,\" Saint Francis High School said in a statement to KRON.\n\nAs a result of the disagreement, the school claims to explore further legal options, \"including appeal as there is no legal precedent applying that claim to a high school.\"\n\nSaint Francis High here references the plaintiffs' appeal for breach of contract, claiming no school has ever given the option to expel a student without giving them a fair chance for trial among administrators at the school.\n\ndocument-2Download\n\n\"We are grateful for the strong support of our community throughout this case.

One of the boys, who was hosting the other two, had severe acne, and his friends applied the masks in an act of playful solidarity. They took the picture because they thought they looked \"silly.\"\n\nThree years later, after another teenager obtained the picture and posted it online, the two St. Francis students were falsely accused of posing in blackface and forced to leave the school under the threat of expulsion. This week a California jury awarded the boys, identified as A.H. and H.H. in their lawsuit against the school, $1 million in damages, plus a tuition reimbursement of about $70,000.\n\n\"A photograph of this innocent event was plucked from obscurity and grossly mischaracterized during the height of nationwide social unrest,\" the boys' familes said when they filed their lawsuit in 2021. The photo came to light in June 2020, a month after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd. \"St. Francis became involved in a number of racial scandals,\" NBC News reports, \"including one where recent graduates of the school posted a meme about Floyd's death on Instagram.\" Because of that context, A.H. and H.H. argued, St. Francis officials rushed to judgment, tarring the students as racist and disrupting their lives without giving them a chance to explain the photo.\n\n\"The boys did not use the facemasks or take the photograph with any ill-intent, bias or prejudice, let alone in connection with any racist sentiments or epithets,\" the lawsuit said. \"Defendants took it upon themselves to use the innocent and wholly unrelated photograph of the boys to make the malicious and utterly false accusation that the boys had been engaging in 'blackface,' and to recklessly assert that the photograph was 'another example' of racism\" at St. Francis. That false accusation, according to the complaint, interrupted the boys' educations, destroyed their local reputations, and forced their families to move.\n\nThe jury agreed that St. Francis had treated the boys unfairly, thereby violating an oral contract. More controversially, the jury accepted a claim under the California Supreme Court's \"common law doctrine of fair procedure,\" which extends due process requirements to private actors such as unions, hospitals, insurers, and professional organizations. Last year, the court ruled that the doctrine also applies to private universities. But according to the attorneys who represented A.H. and H.H., this is the first time the doctrine has been applied to a private secondary school.\n\n\"This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California, which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them,\" said Dhillon Law Group partner Krista Baughman. \"The jury rightly confirmed that St. Francis High School's procedures were unfair to our clients and that the school is not above the law.\"\n\nKarin Sweigart, another lawyer at the firm, emphasized that it took four years to definitively refute the school's erroneous claim about the supposedly racist nature of the photo. \"The jury's verdict finally cleared our clients' names after four long years of repeated personal attacks from St. Francis High School,\" she said. \"Schools are supposed to protect and nurture children, not sacrifice them when it is convenient for public relations purposes.\"\n\nThe school's representatives said they \"respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion\" about \"the fairness of our disciplinary review process.\" They added that the school is \"exploring legal options,\" including a possible appeal.\n\nThe plaintiffs' attorneys note that \"St. Francis expelled the boys within 24 hours, without considering their evidence or offering any hearing.\" They add that \"the school's actions led to significant personal, educational, and emotional consequences for the students.\"\n\nThe boys' parents amplified that point. \"We would never wish the pain, humiliation, and suffering St. Francis has inflicted on our families on anyone,\" they said, \"but we are thankful that the jury has spoken,\" \"vindicated our boys,\" and \"forced St. Francis to finally take responsibility for their repeated personal attacks.\"\n\nEven with \"time to reflect and contemplate after the heat of the moment had subsided,\" the parents said, St. Francis officials \"don't regret their actions\" and \"would do the same thing today.\" Although the case has consumed \"twenty percent of our boys' lives,\" they said, \"the sacrifice is worth it to clear our boys' names\" and \"to try and make sure that St. Francis can never again assume a child is guilty\" without giving him \"the opportunity to show [his] innocence.\"", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_sullum@reason.com", "name": "Jacob Sullum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

It was immediately seized upon as an example of the racism that was supposedly everywhere in the aftermath of the deadly Black Lives Matter riots.\n\nRather than launch a proper investigation, which would have undoubtedly cleared the boys of any wrongdoing, the teens' school effectively branded them as racists then had them expelled.\n\n\"We would never wish the pain, humiliation, and suffering St. Francis has inflicted on our families on anyone,\" said the Hughes family\n\nSaint Francis High School in Mountain View, California, has paid the price for rushing to judgment.\n\nWith the help of the Dhillon Law Group, which has represented other minors similarly traduced over racially-charged hoaxes, the teens, Holden Hughes and Aaron Harley, sued the high school with their parents for over $20 million. While ultimately unable to exact the full toll for their malignment, the former students walked walked away this week with $1 million plus tuition reimbursement.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times indicated that a Santa Clara County jury sided with the former students who claimed the school breached an oral contract and failed to give them due process before expelling them.\n\n\"Twenty percent of our boys' lives have been spent seeing this process come to fruition. But the sacrifice is worth it to clear our boys' names, and to try and make sure that St. Francis can never again assume a child is guilty without giving a child the opportunity to show their innocence. To never again sacrifice any child to protect the school's reputation like they did our boys,\" the Hughes family said in a statement.\n\n\"We would never wish the pain, humiliation, and suffering St. Francis has inflicted on our families on anyone, but we are thankful that the jury has spoken, and vindicated our boys, and forced St. Francis to finally take responsibility for their repeated personal attacks on the boys,\" added the family.\n\nThe original complaint indicated that on Aug. 17, 2017, Hughes and Hartley, then both 14 years old, put on white acne masks that Hartley's mother purchased to help with his skin condition, reported NBC News.\n\n\"Believing themselves to look 'silly' in the masks, [Harley] and [a friend from another school identified as Minor III] took a time-stamped photograph of themselves in the masks,\" said the lawsuit.\n\nThe next day, Hughes, Hartley and Minor III instead tried on a light green acne face mask.\n\n\"Again, they took a silly photograph in this mask, which had turned dark green by the time it dried on their faces,\" said the lawsuit.\n\nThe boys did not share the image online. However, Minor III shared it to a friend, who ultimately \"tagged a music playlist on her Spotify account with a copy of the photograph.\"\n\nYears later, a student at the school reportedly obtained a copy of the photo, named the students, and insinuated that they had engaged in blackface.\n\nAlicia Labana, a parent originally named as a defendant in the suit, made matters worse by allegedly posting the photo on Facebook ahead of a planned march to protest \"outrageous behavior\" and to pressure the school to act.\n\nAccording to lawsuit, the image was condemned by school staff and parents alike and prompted a parent-led protest against the minors.\n\nJason Curtis, president of the school, reportedly rushed to issue a public condemnation. Absent an investigation into the image, a hearing taking up the accusations or the involvement of the school's review board, Hartley and Hughes were told within 24 hours of the scandal breaking they had to withdraw from the school or face expulsion.\n\nThe teens left the school in June 2020 and filed suit the following year.\n\nHughes reportedly indicated his family had to put up security cameras around their home and pled with the Los Altos Police to execute additional patrols in the area for fear of attacks.\n\nHartley said his family had to move away on account of the persistent harassment and that he had to complete high school remotely, reported the Post.\n\nThe Palo Alto Post reported that a jury of 12 reached their verdict on Monday following 20 days of testimony and three days of deliberation. The boys will receive $500,000 each from the high school and be reimbursed for their tuition, an estimated $70,000 for their three years at Saint Francis High School.\n\nSaint Francis High School spokesman Jamie Perkins said in a statement obtained by the Post, \"We respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion ... regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process and are exploring legal options, including appeal as there is no legal precedent applying that claim to a high school.\"\n\nThe former students' legal team suggested that this case establishes a new precedent by extending protections set by the California Supreme Court in Boermeester v. Carry, which requires fair procedure rights for students at private universities. Accordingly, such fair procedure rights will allegedly apply to private high schools.\n\nKrista Baughman, partner at the Dhillon Law Group, stated, \"This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California, which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them.\"\n\n\"The jury's verdict finally cleared our clients' names after four long years of repeated personal attacks from St. Francis High School. Schools are supposed to protect and nurture children, not sacrifice them when it is convenient for public relations purpose,\" added Karin Sweigart, counsel with the Dhillon Law Group.\n\nThe former students' parents expressed hope that this result will prompt the school's board of directors to \"hold those responsible for these actions and make needed changes to protect students moving forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

(CITC) -- Two California students accused of wearing blackface received $1 million on Monday in a settlement with their former high school, according to the Dhillon Law Group, which represented them.\n\nSaint Francis High School purportedly expelled the students, referred to as A.H. and H.H., after photos showing them in acne face masks at 14 years old surfaced in 2020. Parents allegedly took issue with the pictures, which the students took three years earlier, and protested Saint Francis's tolerance of what was deemed racially insensitive behavior.\n\nThe school forced the students to withdraw or face expulsion and denied their ability to appeal, according to the attorneys. Saint Francis Principal Katie Teekell allegedly told the students' parents the expulsions were for \"optics,\" rather than \"intent.\"\n\nThe jury's verdict finally cleared our clients' names after four long years of repeated personal attacks from St. Francis High School,\" attorney Jarin Sweigart said. \"Schools are supposed to protect and nurture children, not sacrifice them when it is convenient for public relations purposes.\"\n\nThe settlement sets a precedent of allowing high school students to have a fair opportunity to respond to disciplinary actions, according to the attorneys. Saint Francis disputed the jury's conclusion it had unfair disciplinary procedures.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process and are exploring legal options, including appeal as there is no legal precedent applying that claim to a high school,\" the school told Crisis in the Classroom. \"We look forward to putting this matter behind us.\"\n\nThe jury rejected the students' claims Saint Francis defamed and violated their right to free speech, according to the school. The students' parents alleged their children suffered reputational damage as a result of Saint Francis's actions.\n\n\"We would never wish the pain, humiliation, and suffering St. Francis has inflicted on our families on anyone, but we are thankful that the jury has spoken, and vindicated our boys, and forced St. Francis to finally take responsibility for their repeated personal attacks on the boys,\" the parents said.\n\nThey argued the school also risked their children's safety and health while jeopardizing the students' ability to complete high school, gain admittance to a \"suitable college\" and compete in sports.\n\n\"Twenty percent of our boys' lives have been spent seeing this process come to fruition,\" the parents said. \"But the sacrifice is worth it to clear our boys' names, and to try to make sure that St. Francis can never again assume a child is guilty without giving a child the opportunity to show their innocence. To never again sacrifice any child to protect the school's reputation like they did our boys.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbs6albany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRGB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_lewis@cbs6albany.com", "name": "Ray Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francis of Assisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_High_School_(Mountain_View,_California)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Francis High School (Mountain View, California)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expulsion (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Child_and_Adolescent", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Child and Adolescent", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Youth and High School", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media/74572d5e-ea34-4058-ac53-3657389aead3-large16x9_0987654323456789.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552536", "eventUri": "eng-9552536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The Santa Clara County jury ruled in favor of the teens, identified only as A.H. and H.H., on charges of breach of oral contract and denial of due process.\n\nThe dispute began when photos of the teens wearing acne treatment masks were misinterpreted as blackface, leading to their pressured withdrawal from the prestigious Mountain View school. The photos, which had been taken three years earlier, showed the boys using dark green face masks, a day after they had tried white masks.\n\nThe controversy erupted in June 2020 when the images were circulated alongside a meme related to the murder of George Floyd, causing a significant backlash. A fellow student shared the image in a group chat, erroneously accusing the teens of engaging in blackface and labeling it as further evidence of racism at SFHS.\n\nAmidst the heated atmosphere, the school's administration, led by Principal Katie Teekell, suggested that one of the boys voluntarily withdraw to avoid expulsion and a permanent mark on his academic record\u010f\u017c\"\"a promise which was later retracted. Teekell's decision was purportedly based not on the intent behind the photograph but on its optics and the alleged harm caused to the school community. The boys were officially withdrawn from SFHS by June 19, 2020.\n\nThe lawsuit filed against the school claimed that the administration did not adequately investigate the matter nor did they offer assistance in correcting the misinterpretations of the photograph. Following their withdrawal, the boys faced further challenges, including restrictions on participating in sports at new schools due to the circumstances under which they left SFHS.\n\nAfter a series of legal proceedings, the jury\u010f\u017c\" s decision awarded the plaintiffs $1 million and covered additional costs related to the boys' relocation and tuition. The families of the boys stated that the lawsuit was aimed at reclaiming their reputation and clarifying the true nature of the incident.\n\nDespite the jury\u010f\u017c\" s decision, SFHS has expressed disagreement with the findings regarding the fairness of their disciplinary process and is considering appealing the decision.

The jury also agreed that the school breached an oral contract after promising that they would not share the reason for the school transfer with other schools, then reversing their decision, said Krista Baughman, partner at Dhillon Law Group, which represented the plaintiffs in the case.\n\n\"Since the day this happened, the clients were cast with this accusation that wasn't true,\" Baughman said. \"They're young men. They've got their whole lives ahead of them. The primary goal of this case was to clear their good names.\"\n\nThe boys, who were identified by their initials in the case and were minors at the time it was filed, lost on three other claims of violation of free speech, defamation and breach of contract.\n\nSaint Francis High School disagreed with the jury's decision about the fairness of the school's disciplinary process, a school spokesperson said in a statement. The school is considering its future legal options, including appealing the case, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We appreciate the jury's verdict rejecting the plaintiffs' two primary claims of defamation and breach of contract and thank them for their thoughtful analysis,\" the Saint Francis High School spokesperson said. \"The jury rightly found we did not breach our handbook, did not violate the students' free speech rights and did not defame the students.\"\n\nIn early June 2020, Saint Francis officials learned of the photograph of the boys wearing the face mask after another student sent it in a group chat, according to the complaint. The school called the parents of each boy on June 4; the parents explained the photo was not of blackface but rather of the boys wearing acne face masks three years earlier.\n\nA day later, the school told the boys that they would not be welcome to return to the school. The complaint stated that the school's principal told one of the boy's parents that \"this isn't about intent, it's about optics.\"\n\nThe school gave the boys the option to leave voluntarily or face expulsion. The principal said that she would not share the reason for the transfer if the boys left, Baughman said. One of the boys planned to continue playing football with the goal of playing in college, but the principal reneged on her prior promise, according to the family lawyer, and said she would have to disclose that he was transferring due to a disciplinary situation when given a specific form required for high school athletes transferring between California schools.\n\nThat essentially blacklisted the plaintiff from playing sports in California, Baughman said. To continue his playing career, he moved to Utah, forcing the family to live separately for his final year of high school.\n\nIn its decision, the jury agreed with the boys' contention that the school did not conduct a thorough investigation into the photo before expulsion, violating their right to due process. The decision extends a previous California Supreme Court decision that recognized the right to due process for college students at private universities in the state.\n\nThe jury \"gave the boys the fair hearing they never got from Saint Francis,\" Baughman said.\n\nThe jury's decision, once finalized, will require that all high schools across the state uphold students' right to due process. Schools will be able to create their own rules, Baughman said, but this decision ensures that students will \"have some form of ability to present their evidence and have it heard in a fair manner.\"\n\nThe jury also awarded one defendant his expenses related to relocating to Utah to continue playing sports, Baughman added.\n\n\"We want to sincerely thank the jury and the court system for helping our boys and our families find justice, which now paves the way for their names to be cleared for things they never did,\" the Hughes family, the family of one of the two boys, said in a statement. \"St. Francis can never again assume a child is guilty without giving a child the opportunity to show their innocence.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The plaintiffs said when his two friends saw him applying the cream, the two boys then followed suit in solidarity.\n\nIn court filings, the school's attorney says administrators disagreed with the families' explanation that the photo was innocent.\n\nWhile two of the boys' families say Saint Francis High mishandled the situation and are seeking damages for defamation and breach of contract, the school says it had \"sole discretion\" to punish the two students and that the families left voluntarily in June 2021.\n\nThe former students and their parents initially sought $20 million when they sued Saint Francis High in 2020, shortly after the photo surfaced online.\n\nAs criticism mounted, school administrators gave the boys a choice of voluntarily withdrawing or being expelled. The students withdrew.\n\n\"Tragically, defendants achieved their goal of portraying (the) plaintiffs as poster children of racism at (Saint Francis High School), resulting in the devastating destruction of the boys' young lives,\" attorneys for the Dhillon Law Group wrote in their court complaint, in which they accused the school of \"virtue signaling\" and rushing to punish the teens without a fair investigation.\n\nFollowing Monday's verdict, Saint Francis High must pay both students $500,000 each, as well as a little under $60,000 for tuition reimbursement, court filings said.\n\n\"The jury rightly found we did not breach our handbook, did not violate the students' free speech rights, and did not defame the students. However, we respectfully disagree with the jury's conclusion as to the lesser claim regarding the fairness of our disciplinary review process,\" Saint Francis High School said in a statement to KRON.\n\nAs a result of the disagreement, the school claims to explore further legal options, \"including appeal as there is no legal precedent applying that claim to a high school.\"\n\nSaint Francis High here references the plaintiffs' appeal for breach of contract, claiming no school has ever given the option to expel a student without giving them a fair chance for trial among administrators at the school.\n\n\"We are grateful for the strong support of our community throughout this case. We look forward to putting this matter behind us so we can return to focusing solely on educating our vibrant student body and living the Catholic values of the Holy Cross tradition, which are rooted in hope, respect, integrity and family,\" Saint Francis Highschool said.", "source": {"uri": "kron4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KRON4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hamza_fahmy@kron4.com", "name": "Hamza Fahmy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francis of Assisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_High_School_(Mountain_View,_California)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Francis High School (Mountain View, California)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRON-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KRON-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_the_Holy_Cross", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College of the Holy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Child_and_Adolescent", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Child and Adolescent", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Youth and High School", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/High School", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/05/GettyImages-1230467232.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552536", "eventUri": "eng-9552536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 452988929, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 28, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 28}}}

With Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone all in pot one, fans knew there would be no all-Dundee or top flight Tayside clashes thrown up. Similarly, Raith Rovers and Dunfermline were together in pot two, ruling out a Fife derby in the group stages. Nevertheless, the draw, broadcast live on the SPFL\u2019s YouTube channel on Wednesday, did contain a number of eye-catching contests, with Raith Rovers\u2019 Vs Ross County shaping up to be particularly tasty after the sides\u2019 Premiership play-off encounter. Dundee United United were the first Tayside team out of the hat, finding themselves in Group B. The newly promoted Tangerines were joined by Ayr United, Falkirk, Stenhousemuir and Buckie Thistle, leaving the Honest Men as the only side in the group who did not win their league last season. Dundee Tony Docherty\u2019s Dark Blues were first pick in Group D. Inverness Caley Thistle\u2019s subsequent arrival raised the prospect of a long journey up the A9 for both sides, given ICT\u2019s new training base in Kelty. But Arboath were the third side picked, giving the Dee one tie with a local feel. Annan Athletic and and Bonnyrigg Rose completed the group, affording Dundee a good chance of progressing to the knockout stages. St Johnstone Saints found themselves in Group F and were soon joined by Greenock Morton, Alloa, East Fife and Brechin City. The Perth side endured a rotten group stage last season. This time around, they will look to give their fans hope for the campaign ahead after yet another poor season in the Premiership. Dunfermline Dunfermline joined newly-relegated Livingston in Group E. Cove Rangers, Spartans and Forfar filled it out, giving the Pars a decent shot at reaching the next stage, albeit with Livi as something of an unknown quantity after the drop. Raith Rovers Rovers were handed a quick-fire shot at revenge against Ross County after finding themselves in Group H with their play-off foes. Hamilton Accies, Stirling Albion and Stranraer were the other sides drawn. But all eyes will surely be on Rovers\u2019 clash with County as the pair renew hostilities.

{"id": 231349494, "title": "Alexander: A perfectly eloquent appreciation of Vin Scully", "text": "Vin Scully never wrote an autobiography, and in fact he turned down multiple requests, from multiple authors, to collaborate on a book. The one biography that was published, Curt Smith\u2019s \u201cPull Up A Chair,\u201d released in 2010, was done without Scully\u2019s cooperation \u2013 and, as the story goes, Vin wasn\u2019t terribly thrilled with it. \u201cAnd he\u2019d always give a different reason\u201d for not wanting to do a book project, recalled Tom Hoffarth, a former sports media columnist for the Daily News and the guy who recently filled that vacuum with \u201cPerfect Eloquence: An Appreciation of Vin Scully,\u201d a collection of essays about the late Scully, the 67-year voice of the Dodgers. \u201cI really think, (a), he didn\u2019t want to put the time into it because it would take away from his family, and (b), I don\u2019t think he was interested in feeding his own ego that way,\u201d Hoffarth said in a recent phone conversation. \u201cAnd then \u2013 the reaction he gave to me was that he just didn\u2019t want to favor one writer over another, which was kind of a nice way to say it.\u201d Consider Hoffarth, then, the unofficial archivist of all things Scully. That was the genesis of the book that was released May 1, a collection of \u2013 in a freakish coincidence \u2013 67 essays from people with their own memories of Scully, be it hiding the transistor radio under the pillow at night or having a personal interaction with Vin. Hoffarth had a lot to work with. Like most of us who occasionally or frequently showed up in the Dodger Stadium press box, he had plenty of conversations with Scully, some informal, some in passing, some when Vin would stop at one of the writers\u2019 tables in the press dining room to chat and kibitz and swap jokes. And occasionally we\u2019d set up formal interviews, chances for Vin to pull up a chair and spend some time with us. Or vice versa. I\u2019d say that whenever that happened, I got way more out of it than he did. For instance, in 2015 I was working on a retrospective of the 50th anniversary of Sandy Koufax\u2019s perfect game, and it was a given that I\u2019d want to talk to Scully, whose ninth-inning play-by-play \u2013 ad-libbed but a near-perfect narrative in its own right \u2013 was every bit as memorable as Sandy\u2019s pitching. And at the end of our conversation, he told me: \u201cI didn\u2019t do much for you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do a heck of a lot better with it.\u201d Hoffarth said he had \u201c30 years\u2019 worth of material, interviews and things that maybe 10 percent gets in your column and 90 percent is just kind of sitting there. Great stuff. You can\u2019t use it anywhere. So I just kind of knew I had all this material. And I think when he died, in August of 2022, I was thinking, \u2018I wonder how many people are going to be able to give him a eulogy.\u2019 And then I wondered how many people really wanted to give him a eulogy. I\u2019m sure the numbers that wanted to far outreached the numbers that did, and I think it\u2019s because the funeral was such a private affair.\u201d This book was their platform, because those essays are the guts of it. Hoffarth wrote the text that bridged the individual remembrances, incorporating some of the material he\u2019d picked up through the years. It is, appropriately, divided into nine chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of Scully\u2019s life and work, with such subtitles as \u201cFamily and Faith,\u201d or \u201cThe Voice of a Storyteller,\u201d or \u201cHumility and Sincerity.\u201d Among those who contributed were: Baseball people (Peter O\u2019Malley, Bud Selig, Bruce Froemming, Orel Hershiser, Eric Karros, Steve Garvey, Ned Colletti). Broadcasters (Bob Costas, Al Michaels, Joe Buck, Bob Miller, Jim Hill, John Ireland, Jill Painter Lopez, colleagues Ross Porter and Jaime Jarr\u00edn and current Dodger broadcasters Joe Davis and Jessica Mendoza, who were in the booth in San Francisco the night Vin passed away Aug. 2, 2022). Those of us in the print media (including the late T.J. Simers, Bill Dwyre, Steve Dilbeck, Brian Golden and Lisa Nehus Saxon, as well as current Daily News columnist Dennis McCarthy). There were others you might not expect, like author/historian David Halberstam, women\u2019s basketball legend Ann Meyers Drysdale, the widow of pitcher and later Dodger broadcast colleague Don Drysdale, and actors Bryan Cranston and Harry Shearer. And Doug Mann, who handled statistics for most of this region\u2019s broadcast crews at one time or another. Mann, like Simers, recently passed away, but each got to see the finished product. While he didn\u2019t get her to write an essay, Hoffarth did get a promotional blurb from Annette Bening (thanks to L.A. Times columnist Patt Morrison, who was a contributor). Also providing blurbs: Political columnist George Will and Ron Shelton, the director of the movie \u201cBull Durham.\u201d And Koufax, who simply wrote: \u201cVin was more than a broadcaster, he was my friend.\u201d The title of the book, Hoffarth said, came from a May, 2016 Sports Illustrated story by Tom Verducci, early in Scully\u2019s final season as a broadcaster, that detailed a seminar class he had taken as a freshman at Fordham. The title, in Latin: \u201cEloquentia Perfecta.\u201d It was \u201cbasically about how to be a good orator, and how you\u2019re not the story,\u201d Hoffarth said. \u201cYou\u2019re the conveyor of this, and you do this with humility. (That\u2019s) the perfect way to explain what Vin did.\u201d Vin was a storyteller at heart, and I\u2019ve always said that he could tell the same story multiple times and it would sound fresh each time. Similarly, a good number of the essays in this book repeated anecdotes or stories, each through an individual\u2019s perception, and \u2026 yes, they were fresh. Put together, and grouped as the essays were into different facets of Scully\u2019s life, the book flows seamlessly. \u201cVin had so many stories about different things that I forgot about, and it was nice to go and find those things again, whether it was about patriotism, or little things (like) all those note cards that I got over the years (from him) thanking me for a column I wrote or something,\u201d Hoffarth said. \u201cAnd the great thing was, it was a common thing so I could get reinforcement from all those other essayists, like, \u2018Oh, yeah, he did this for me,\u2019 (or) \u2018He made a call to a person that was sick and just gave them a nice feeling that day.\u2019\u201d And that brings us to the other facet of Vin Scully. As accomplished as he was at his job, he was equally humble and unaffected and willing to engage with the public. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great life lesson on how to be a humble, graceful person, and not think that you have to feed your ego by saying or doing certain things,\u201d Hoffarth said. \u201cYou can really have an impact on people just by being nice and kind to them. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s just a great reminder every day, how to try to be a better person. And everything he did was modeling that.\u201d This is not the last word, either. Hoffarth said his plan is to create a website, the \u201cVin Scully Appreciation Book,\u201d for others to submit stories and create a living tribute. The initial motivation is to create a giant thank you card for the family by the time the 100th anniversary of Scully\u2019s birth rolls around in 2027. And maybe, just maybe, even as society and its media evolve, the fundamentals of storytelling will remain consistent, and the art\u2019s greatest practitioner will still have an influence. \u201cThis was a guy who held your attention, and he did it for these reasons and these reasons still stick with people,\u201d Hoffarth said. \u201cIt sticks with us when we\u2019re trying to tell stories. We know there has to be a beginning, a middle and an end, and there has to be a purpose to it. And Vin, you know, had the basics of storytelling down. And now we take that into different places in our life. \u201cWhether we have to write a term paper or a column, we\u2019re all following Vin\u2019s lead.\u201d Then again \u2013 as you might tell from the length of this column \u2013 we don\u2019t all have to wrap up our stories before the third out. jalexander@scng.com", "summary": "The collection of essays edited by former Daily News media columnist Tom Hoffarth is a tribute to baseball's greatest storyteller.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/08/alexander-a-perfectly-eloquent-appreciation-of-vin-scully/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hoffy-w-book-cropped-16x9-1.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:00:02", "author": "Jim Alexander", "authors": ["Jim Alexander"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.001}

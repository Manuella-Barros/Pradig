Thursday's Presidential debate saw Trump and Joe Biden clash head-to-head, as the former U.S. President battles to return to the Oval Office. Apart from their differences in policy and decision-making routes, their conversation veered towards a competition of their golfing ability Both Trump and Biden are keen about golf during their downtime away from office, yet Trump's standing in the sport appears to be somewhat murky.

As the title expresses, Trump's relationship with golf is marred by claims of cheating \"To say ' Donald Trump cheats' is like saying 'Michael Phelps swims,'\" the ex-Sports Illustrated journalist columnist wrote. \"He cheats at the highest level. He cheats when people are watching and he cheats when they aren't. He cheats whether you like it or not. \"He cheats because that's how he plays golf ... if you're playing golf with him, he's going to cheat.\" In addition to these controversial assertions, Reilly delved into the ongoing debate about Trump's golf handicap. The former President boasts a handicap index of 2.8, ranking him among the top five percent of U.S. golfers. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. Yet, Reilly is sceptical, claiming that if Trump's really a 2.8 handicap golfer then the late Queen Elizabeth 'is a pole vaulter'. Trump brought his golfing prowess into the spotlight during Thursday's debate, criticising Biden's reported six handicap and boasting about his own club championship victories. \"To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way and I do it. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match, he can't hit a ball 50 yards.\" Biden responded by proposing a long drive contest and a round of golf. \"I got my handicap, which when I was vice president, down to a six,\" Biden claimed. \"And by the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it? \" Trump, doubting Biden's golfing abilities, retorted: \"That's the biggest lie that he's a six handicap of all.\" Biden seemed to catch his own slip-up, saying: \"I was an eight handicap. Yeah. Eight.\" Trump, on the other hand, boasts ownership of 16 golf courses worldwide, including a dozen in the US, two in Scotland, one in Ireland, and another in the United Arab Emirates.", "summary": "Donald Trump and Joe Biden went head-to-head in a Presidential debate on Thursday, with the conversation soon turning to who was the better golfer out of the pair", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/donald-trump-accused-cheating-highest-33130835", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33130832.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-1589802944.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:00:00", "author": "Joshua Lees", "authors": ["Joshua Lees"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.221}

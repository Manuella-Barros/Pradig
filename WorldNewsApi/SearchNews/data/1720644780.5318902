Cricket\u2019s most iconic rivalry is all set to resume in New York on 6 June, as India will face arch-rivals Pakistan in a Group A encounter of the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024. Billed as the \u2018blockbuster event\u2019 of the first-ever World Cup in the USA, the titanic clash will be viewed by millions across the globe via television and OTT screens. People from all over the world are flocking to Long Island to watch the high-voltage game at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, which is certain to be filled to the brim.The two South Asian giants have got off to sharply contrasting starts at the event. While India thumped Ireland easily, Pakistan was stunned by World Cup debutants USA in their opening match. Given this curious context, the key question is \u2013 will India maintain an upper hand in the upcoming clash, or will mercurial Pakistan roar back to surprise Rohit Sharma and his warriors?T20 World Cup: A Look at India and Pakistan's T20I Rivalry Over the YearsSunil Chhetri & Virat Kohli \u2013 Destined To Fail. Fated To Fall. Still, They Rose.Who Could Be India\u2019s Next Sunil Chhetri? What Do Indian Football Fans Think?This seemingly simple but tantalising query cannot be easily answered with confidence, given the history of close contests India vs Pakistan clashes have invariably produced. This match will also be the first T20 meeting between India and Pakistan since their electrifying encounter in Australia at the T20 World Cup of 2022. Etched in the memory of all fans is the manner in which India pulled off an incredible victory, thanks largely to a masterclass by Virat Kohli in that pulsating thriller. Kohli's unbeaten 82 off 53 balls under enormous pressure reflected his batting brilliance and reinforced his stature as one of the greatest chasers of the game. No wonder, most fans in New York and even experts think that \u2018King Kohli\u2019 could well be a critical factor in the clash on Sunday. Besides Kohli, India have a bunch of other match-winning performers in its batting unit. Skipper Rohit Sharma is in good nick and his fine 51 against Ireland has made him only the third batter after Kohli and Mahela Jayawardene to score over a thousand runs in T20 World Cup. The dynamic Suryakumar Yadav, who tops the T20I batters' rankings, adds an explosive dimension to Indian batting. Rishabh Pant\u2019s heartening comeback enriches India\u2019s batting resources and the big-hitting prowess of all-rounders Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube provides greater depth and firepower to Team India. On the bowling front, pace-ace Jasprit Bumrah leads the pack and his form is especially critical as Mohammed Shami is absent due to injury. In Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj and Hardik, India has good pace and seaming options while spinners, Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav are all crafty and the ever-reliable Ravindra Jadeja further bolsters the spin arsenal. Although the Rohit Sharma-Rahul Dravid thinktank faces some tough selection dilemmas, the practice game with Bangladesh and the World Cup match with Ireland have shown that India is well-prepared to take on Pakistan. In sharp contrast, Pakistan\u2019s defeat to the USA in their tournament opener was an absolute shocker, although known for their unpredictability, they might well bounce back. Hopes will be pinned on captain Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, the bulwarks of Pakistan batting for years, and the likes of Fakhar Zaman and Iftikhar Ahmed to bolster the batting. Pakistan\u2019s bowling battery, however, is a much more menacing unit than their batting. Shaheen Afridi\u2019s pace and ability to swing the ball sharply makes him a potent threat. Supported by Harris Rauf, Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir, the pace quartet can trouble the best of batters. Most experts believe Pakistan\u2019s key strategy will revolve around early breakthroughs with the ball and then building pressure through tight, disciplined bowling.Given their full potential, India and Pakistan may well serve a high-octane classic on Sunday but the pitch at Nassau Stadium has behaved erratically in the games so far, with pacers posing serious threats.The ICC has accepted the criticism about the drop-down pitches from Australia which have made batting difficult, especially with its awkward bounce injuring some batters. Although assurance has been given that the pitch will be improved before the big game, the morning dew could still play a vital role in the fortunes of the team batting first.With most Indian players coming off successful stints in the IPL season and India getting off to a strong start, experts and fans alike believe Rohit\u2019s warriors have a distinct edge. The fans believe the same, as they are willing to spend as much as $10,000 (roughly 8.3 lakh rupees) to watch the likes of Kohli and Rohit in action.Since pride and crucial points are at stake, the match promises a brilliant mix of cricketing excellence and fierce competition. Fortunately, weather forecasts predict clear skies and spectators could enjoy an undisturbed match. Though it remains to be seen whether India\u2019s tactical acumen or Pakistan\u2019s mercurial flair will ultimately prevail, the marquee match of the T20 World Cup could script an epic encounter in cricket\u2019s most famous rivalry!(At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience.

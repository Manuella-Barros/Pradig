'It's not all about the scoreline, it's about how the frame was won and there was obviously a lot of tension in there.\n\nKyren Wilson is seven frames away from a maiden World Snooker Championship title\n\n'I'm proud of the way I held it together. I had in my head I wanted to get to 11 tonight having been on seven (after the afternoon session). Target achieved.'\n\nJones - who labelled rivals who criticise his perceived slow style of play as 'pathetic' - fought back from 7-0 down, reducing the arrears to five frames to give hope of further thrills and spills.\n\n'It's a miracle that I'm still in it as I played shocking. I'm still in the match,' Jones added.\n\n'Get a good night's sleep, come out flying tomorrow and things could happen.'\n\nWilson looked comfortable from the start and got the best of the big moments.\n\nHe began the day in blistering fashion. His 129 break was the first in the opening frame of a final since Stephen Hendry's 136 against Jimmy White in 1993.\n\nRuns of 52, 66, 62, 84, 125 and 90 followed yesterday afternoon as the World No 12 sped into a 7-0 lead.\n\nIt matched the start made by John Parrott in the 1991 final, on the way to winning his only world title with 18-11 win over White.\n\nFor Jones, a 200-1 pre-tournament outsider and the World No 44, he melted under the heat in his first ranking tournament final. His plight was not helped by playing a well-rested man in the form of his life.\n\nWhile Kettering-based Wilson reached the final with a session to spare after beating David Gilbert on Saturday afternoon, Jones was forced to scrap through a 12-hour tussle with Stuart Bingham.\n\nJones, who has only scored two centuries on his run to the final, failed to compile big breaks against Bingham and could not disrupt the metronomic Wilson's rhythm until the latter stages.\n\nThe relief was palpable when he won his first frame with a 65 break at the end of the first session and celebrated with a smile and a fist pump. Cwmbran-born Jones made that three in a row as he went to 7-3, but Wilson stopped the run with a nerveless 125 to restore his five-frame advantage.\n\nAnd Wilson, who admitted he has been approached about a breakaway tour away from World Snooker, took control of a vital frame before the mid-session interval to extend his lead.\n\nThe pattern of the first session was never likely to be repeated, but Wilson showed his class and mettle to keep Jones's resurgence at bay, splitting the session 2-2.\n\nJak Jones reduced the arrears to five frames to give hope of further thrills and spills\n\nBut the Nando's-loving Welshman showed his spicy side after the mid-session interval, winning a crucial frame after an unusual Wilson miss with the rest to make it 9-4.\n\nWilson responded with another rapid century - the 122 was his fourth of the final - as Jones countered by winning the 15th frame in gutsy fashion. He appeared to visibly relax, cracking a smile in his seat between frames.\n\nHe followed that up with a 90 break - his highest of the final - to get back within four frames.\n\nYet after that gripping final frame, Wilson appears to have restored the momentum as a thrilling final day beckons.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jak Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Parrott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Parrott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Bingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Bingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hendry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Hendry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilbert_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Gilbert (snooker player)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/05/23/84487855-0-image-m-70_1714946471964.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

penultimate session of the World Snooker Championship final in Sheffield.\n\nTwice the qualifier, who had lost the first seven frames of the match, hauled back the deficit to three, but on each occasion Wilson responded and ended the afternoon three frames away from the title at 15-10.\n\nJones had staged a sterling recovery in Sunday night's second session but ought to have ended the day just 10-7 down after losing the final frame of the evening on the black after Wilson had required a snooker.\n\nAnd it was a similar story on Monday as the world number 44 blew a golden opportunity in the final frame of the session to pull back to 14-11 and give Wilson much more to think about ahead of the tournament's concluding frames.\n\nJones did the hard work after Wilson missed a simple red when 52 points clear, but having flicked a problematic red off the cushion to put all the balls in play for a dramatic clearance, he missed a yellow to the middle and let Wilson off the hook.\n\nIt summed up the session for Jones, who failed to capitalise on the 12th seed's evident discomfort and now needs to fashion the biggest comeback in the history of the tournament's last session to turn his first ranking final into an improbable win.\n\nJones, who had come through two qualifying rounds and confessed he was \"knackered\" at the end of the opening day of the final, made a dream start to the day with consecutive breaks of 64 and 59 to chip Wilson's lead back to 11-8.\n\nIn doing so the Welshman ensured he would avoid the indignity of becoming the first player since Jimmy White in 1993 to lose the final with a session to spare.\n\nBut Jones' hopes of making further inroads were curtailed by Wilson, who had looked out of sorts in the early stages but unearthed breaks of 50 and 83 to reach the mid-session interval having restored his five-frame overnight advantage at 13-8.\n\nIn a see-saw battle, Jones responded with a break of 90, his highest of the final so far, to haul back another frame, then capitalised when Wilson missed a red to middle with a coolly-taken break of 67, which included a five-minute delay when a member of the audience was taken ill.\n\nJones' evident intention to seldom refuse a pot was clearly paying dividends as he looked a completely different player to the frustrated figure whom Wilson had threatened to blow away in their one-sided opening session on Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut it also guaranteed chances for Wilson, who, having failed to take a handful earlier in the day, finally made good on a missed long red by Jones in the 25th frame with a break of 87 to move back four frames in front.\n\nJones got in first in the potentially pivotal final frame of the afternoon as he looked to reduce Wilson's lead back to three frames for the third time.\n\nBut the jawed yellow gifted Wilson a lifeline and made him hot favourite to wrap up his maiden world title on Monday night.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Mon 6 May 2024, 5:09

Trailing 7-0 at one stage earlier in \u00adproceedings, we were genuinely entering historic territory.\n\nRelated: 'Sheffield is the home of snooker': talk of Crucible exit sparks local concern\n\nNot since 1993 has a final been decided with a session to spare but when Wilson won the first seven frames without reply, it was hard not to wonder what legends of the past those in attendance on Monday \u00adevening would be seeing square off in an \u00adexhibition to fill the slot.\n\nHowever, Jones has at least likely ensured the final will reach on Monday \u00adevening after battling back \u00admagnificently. He raised his fist to the crowd with apparent sarcasm in the afternoon after winning his first frame to avoid an opening \u00adsession whitewash.\n\nHe would have \u00adenvisaged doing the same again at the \u00adculmination of the evening \u00adsession but this time with belief he could win against all the odds. However, you cannot help but wonder just how significant the final frame on Sunday evening could prove to be.\n\nBoth players had their chances to win it. If Jones had prevailed, he'd have trailed by just three. However, Wilson not only claimed the frame to move five ahead overnight, but the momentum too - and he is now hot favourite to win his first world title.\n\nThe only other two players to be 7-0 behind after the opening seven frames of a final were Jimmy White in 1991, who ultimately lost to John Parrott - and Dennis Taylor, who went 8-0 behind in 1985. And we all know what happened that year.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact Jones had to play until late on Saturday evening against Stuart Bingham while his opponent had already got the job done earlier in the day. There is no question that Jones, who has had to play over 20 hours more snooker than Wilson to get to the final, looked jaded on Sunday afternoon.\n\nPerhaps it was Wilson's prior \u00adexperience of a final - having \u00adadmitted in the buildup he drank too much beer and ate too much pizza the night before his 2020 final defeat to Ronnie O'Sullivan - which helped him settle quicker. But whatever the reason, the first final to be contested by two players both bidding for a first world title in almost 20 years was only heading one way at 5pm on Sunday.\n\nNow, its at least slightly more in the balance, but Wilson is heavy favourite, leading 11-6. Wilson was as magnificent as Jones was indifferent on Sunday afternoon. Two century breaks and four more over 50 pushed him 7-0 ahead but there were undisputed frames Jones could, and perhaps should, have won.\n\nThe history books were being rewritten as Wilson moved 7-0 ahead but, when Jones claimed the last frame of the session to narrow the gap to six, it at least felt as though there was something to build upon. But the pair split the opening four frames of the evening session, leaving Wilson in control at 9-3.\n\nHowever, Jones responded well in the final frames of that session. He won three of the next four to make it 10-6; a commanding lead for Wilson, yes, but one that could have been far worse given how proceedings began earlier in the day. The final frame of the day was huge: arguably the most important of both players' careers to this point.\n\nIt was the difference between a five or three-frame lead overnight, and it was stacked with tension. Jones left Wilson needing a snooker, which Wilson got before clearing the colours to the black. However, Wilson missed it, leading to an absorbing and nerve-shredding safety exchange.\n\nThe winner of this frame may not necessarily have held the lead overnight, but they would have undoubtedly had the momentum. And both players clearly knew it given how edgy their play was. And when Jones attempted a risky double, he could only leave the black over the pocket.\n\nWilson took full advantage and this time, it was he who fist-pumped the Crucible crowd. Come Monday evening, that frame could prove to be the most important of them all.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jak Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Parrott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Parrott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Bingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Bingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitewash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O'Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie O'Sullivan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/aa31f393aaab5dc13ca960c87a47a558", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

So intimate, in fact, that you can almost smell the breath of the players as they make their way around the snooker table. But here, on this Sunday afternoon in Sheffield, Jak Jones must have felt like the loneliest person on the planet as his dream slowly eroded into a nightmare.\n\nThe Welshman has made history across the past fortnight, joining the exclusive list of qualifiers to reach the final of the World Snooker Championship and impressing so many along the way. However, Jones is now in the history books for all the wrong reasons after not only losing control of his maiden world final in the opening session, but seeing his hopes almost evaporate already.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact Jones had to play until late on Saturday evening against Stuart Bingham while his opponent here, Kyren Wilson, had already got the job done earlier in the day. There is no question that Jones, who has had to play over 20 hours more snooker than Wilson to get to the final, looked jaded on Sunday afternoon.\n\nPerhaps it is Wilson's prior experience of a final - having admitted in the build-up he drank too much beer and ate too much pizza the night before his 2020 final defeat to Ronnie O'Sullivan - which helped him settle quicker. But whatever the reason, the first final to be contested by two players both bidding for a first world title in almost 20 years looks to be heading only one way.\n\nThis is only the third time in Crucible history that the opening seven frames have been won by one player, and a combination of nervy, edgy play from Jones combined with some stellar play from Wilson himself has made this year's final already feel as if it could finish with some time to spare. The one hope for Jones? He claimed the last frame of the afternoon to avoid a session whitewash.\n\nThings can still change. There are still three more sessions to play, after all and Jones will have to treat them like a new match. But if Jones continues to toil while Wilson excels, this final is going in the direction of only one man. Jones' hopes of becoming world champion hang by a thread.\n\nThe writing was on the wall from the opening two or three frames. These finals can so often be decided by who settles quickest and there was no doubting it was the man from Kettering who did so, with a wonderful 129 clearance in the opening frame. The following two frames were nervy, with both players missing chances, but Wilson claimed both of them to move 3-0 ahead.\n\nThree became four shortly after with a break of 66 from Wilson, the first time a player has gone 4-0 up in a world final since 2018. Jones opted against heading to the practice table in the mid-session interval, instead retreating to his dressing room to try and clear his head. However, it was a move that backfired spectacularly on the Cwmbran cueist.\n\nA break of 62 from Wilson was enough to claim frame five and already, it felt like Jones' first session as a world finalist had gone into damage limitation mode. Mercifully for Jones, as he continued to struggle, Wilson sank further into a groove, with a break of 125 moving him six frames ahead.\n\nThe Crucible crowd erupted into applause that almost felt like it had a tinge of pity attached to it when Jones fluked the opening red of frame seven but yet again, the remainder of the frame followed a familiar pattern as Wilson got back in amongst the balls, secured a break of 90 and a 7-0 lead.\n\nJones needed something, however possible, to cling onto that resembled hope. He got it - and the loudest cheer of the afternoon - with a break of 65 to avoid a session whitewash. The pumping of his fist as he secured the frame underlined how he knew what an 8-0 deficit would have represented.\n\nIf there is one crumb of comfort for Jones, it is in those aforementioned history books. The only other two players to be 7-0 behind after the opening seven frames of a Crucible final were Jimmy White in 1991, who ultimately lost to John Parrott - and Dennis Taylor, who actually went 8-0 behind in 1985.\n\nAnd we all know what happened that year. If Jones could replicate something even remotely like that, it will unquestionably rank as one of snooker's greatest stories.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_bower@theguardian.com", "name": "Aaron Bower", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jak Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Bingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Bingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_table", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billiard table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O'Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie O'Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitewash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Parrott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Parrott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crucible"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c9ffb9cd22777b85dac213046345c68023c681/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1a36a502deb8bc5043381d2cd83365b0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

the qualifier, who had lost the first seven frames of the match, hauled back the deficit to three, but on each occasion Wilson responded and ended the afternoon three frames away from the title at 15-10.\n\nJones had staged a sterling recovery in Sunday night's second session but ought to have ended the day just 10-7 down after losing the final frame of the evening on the black after Wilson had required a snooker.\n\nAnd it was a similar story on Monday as the world number 44 blew a golden opportunity in the final frame of the session to pull back to 14-11 and give Wilson much more to think about ahead of the tournament's concluding frames.\n\nJones did the hard work after Wilson missed a simple red when 52 points clear, but having flicked a problematic red off the cushion to put all the balls in play for a dramatic clearance, he missed a yellow to the middle and let Wilson off the hook.\n\nIt summed up the session for Jones, who failed to capitalise on the 12th seed's evident discomfort and now needs to fashion the biggest comeback in the history of the tournament's last session to turn his first ranking final into an improbable win.\n\nJones, who had come through two qualifying rounds and confessed he was \"knackered\" at the end of the opening day of the final, made a dream start to the day with consecutive breaks of 64 and 59 to chip Wilson's lead back to 11-8.\n\nIn doing so the Welshman ensured he would avoid the indignity of becoming the first player since Jimmy White in 1993 to lose the final with a session to spare.\n\nBut Jones' hopes of making further inroads were curtailed by Wilson, who had looked out of sorts in the early stages but unearthed breaks of 50 and 83 to reach the mid-session interval having restored his five-frame overnight advantage at 13-8.\n\nIn a see-saw battle, Jones responded with a break of 90, his highest of the final so far, to haul back another frame, then capitalised when Wilson missed a red to middle with a coolly-taken break of 67, which included a five-minute delay when a member of the audience was taken ill.\n\nJones' evident intention to seldom refuse a pot was clearly paying dividends as he looked a completely different player to the frustrated figure whom Wilson had threatened to blow away in their one-sided opening session on Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut it also guaranteed chances for Wilson, who, having failed to take a handful earlier in the day, finally made good on a missed long red by Jones in the 25th frame with a break of 87 to move back four frames in front.\n\nJones got in first in the potentially pivotal final frame of the afternoon as he looked to reduce Wilson's lead back to three frames for the third time.\n\nBut the jawed yellow gifted Wilson a lifeline and made him hot favourite to wrap up his maiden world title on Monday night.\n\nFollow the RT\u00c9 Sport WhatsApp channel for the best news, interviews, analysis and features, as well as details of our sports

They are supposed to be the best in the world but are moaning about being knocked out of rhythm.\n\n\"They just can't accept it. It's pathetic really, isn't it? It doesn't bother me.

I'm absolutely knackered and I think if I'd had a decent night's sleep last night I could have done better.\"\n\nJones had experienced a nightmare start and had to wait until the last frame of the first session to get on the scoreboard and avoid becoming the first player since Dennis Taylor in 1985 to lose the first eight frames of the final.\n\nThe Welshman, who fought through a gruelling semi-final win over Stuart Bingham on Saturday night, was clearly relieved when he sunk the frame-ball red, but thoughts focused on whether Wilson could go on to become only the fourth man to win the title with a session to spare.\n\nWilson had been imperious form from the start as he rattled in two centuries, including a break of 129 in the opening frame, and four further half-centuries.\n\nBut the 32-year-old Englishman, in his first final since losing to Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2020, was far from perfect, a straight missed blue in the third frame handing his opponent an opportunity that he failed to convert.\n\nIt was the story of the session for Jones, only the ninth qualifier to reach a Crucible final, who was ruthlessly punished for spurning further opportunities and began to look increasingly ill at ease in his chair.\n\nThe Welshman was criticised by six-times world champion Steve Davis - who inflicted the eight-frame lead on Taylor - for not heading straight for the practice table at the interval.\n\n\"He's been sitting in his chair for four frames,\" Davis told the BBC. \"Why would you not go to the practice table? I don't understand why not.\n\n\"He's absolutely not even got out of the blocks, and he's expecting to pot what could be difficult shots. It's a no-brainer to me to go to the practice table.\"\n\nBesides Taylor's poor start against Davis, the only other time a player lost the first seven frames of a Crucible final was in 1991, when Jimmy White fell 7-0 behind against John Parrott.\n\nBut Jones looked like a revitalised player at the start of the evening session, pouncing with breaks of 75 and 52 in the first two frames to claw back the deficit to 7-3.\n\nJones also had chances in the next two frames but Wilson pulled them back, and when the 12th seed went into the mid-session interval having restored his seven-frame advantage, it looked like the underdog's valiant effort had come to nothing.\n\nWilson responded to Jones pulling another frame back with his fourth century of the day, a flamboyant 122 to go 10-4 in front, but it sparked Jones into fashioning a gutsy turnaround.\n\nThe qualifier took the next two frames, then made a superb break of 64 under the utmost pressure that looked set to turn the momentum of the tie in his favour.\n\nBut a missed yellow left Wilson with one snooker required, and after Wilson's failure to clear the colours, it culminated in the black ball decider that has made a huge difference to the pair's prospects when they resume on Monday afternoon.\n\nWilson said: \"It's not about the scoreline, it's about the way the frame was won.

Wilson stormed into a 7-0 lead during the opening session, before Jones mounted a mini fightback but he is still five frames behind and requires an almighty turnaround to come out on top.\n\nWhile the duo might argue the prestige of the event exceeds the prize money, the bonus for the winner is a sizeable one. More than \u00a32million is distributed to players across the tournament, with even \u00a320,000 going home to those that exited the tournament in the first round.\n\nOne of Wilson or Jones will cash in on \u00a3500,000 for winning the event, the largest cash prize on offer during the World Snooker Tour. The runner-up will have to settle for \u00a3200,000, which is no mean feat considering both players sat outside the top 10 in the world going into the tournament.\n\nJones, world no.44, has never been in the final of a ranking tournament and had to come through qualifying to even make the main draw. He has since beaten Zhang Anda, Si Jiahui, Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham to reach the final.\n\nAccording to CueTracker, the 30-year-old had banked just over \u00a3377,000 in career earnings before the tournament had began. Should Jones complete a famous comeback, he will pocket more in one event than he has in the 14 years since turning professional - a truly remarkable statistic.\n\nAs for Wilson, who previously reached the final in 2020 before losing to Ronnie O'Sullivan, he has reportedly earned around \u00a32.8m during his snooker career, but victory would put him among the elite. Wilson, world no.12, beat David Gilbert 17-11 to clinch his place in his second World Championship final.\n\nKyren Wilson is leading Jak Jones going into the final day at the Crucible\n\nThe winner of the tournament could even bank \u00a3547,500 overall. Any player who makes a maximum 147 break at the Crucible will take home the bonus of an additional \u00a340,000. So far during the 2024 tournament, Noppon Saengkham is only player to achieve that feat despite not making it through qualifying.\n\nSaenghkam therefore still holds the marker for the highest break at the event, which would bring in an additional \u00a315,000 in prize money. However, if Wilson or Jones could muster up a magical 147 during the final, either would pick up half of the prize (\u00a37,500), with the amount being halved over than doubled.\n\nLuca Brecel stormed to victory in the 2023 World Championship final, beating four-time winner Mark Selby to claim the maximum prize money. O'Sullivan and Hendry have won the tournament the joint-most times (seven), with Steve Davis and Ray Reardon both on six apiece.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Wilson still needed several chances before ultimately sinking the black and celebrating with a fist-pump at the end of a gripping safety exchange.\n\nAlthough Jones had won the evening session 5-4, there was still the very clear sense of a major opportunity missed and he will now resume at 1pm on Monday trailing 11-6 in the race to 18 frames.\n\n\"I tend to think that might be his World Championship gone with losing that frame - a five frame going into day two is big,\" said seven times champion Stephen Hendry, who was commentating for the BBC. \"The first two frames on Monday are monsters. It was dead after the afternoon session - he's brought it alive.\"\n\nJones, who had enjoyed a fairytale run to the final following wins against Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham, believes that one of the all-time great Crucible comebacks is still possible.\n\n\"It's a miracle I'm still in it,\" he said. \"I played shocking, absolutely shocking. I'm just knackered, absolutely knackered. If I'd had a decent night's sleep last night it could have been different.\"\n\nDennis Taylor and Jimmy White are the only previous players to have trailed 7-0 in a final and, while Taylor did memorably recover from 8-0 down to beat Steve Davis 18-17 in 1985, that was after reducing the overnight deficit to 9-7.\n\nWilson lost against Ronnie O'Sullivan in his only previous final appearance in 2020 but has been among the world's top 10 almost continuously over the past five years.\n\nJones, who is the world number 44 and needed to win two qualifying matches even to reach the Crucible, has been unhappy during this tournament at some of the reactions to his surprise run to the final.\n\nBoth Trump and Bingham claimed that it had been hard to find their rhythm against a player who is tactically astute but ranked the second slowest for shot time in this year's main draw. Jones has also made only two century breaks en route to snooker's big showpiece occasion compared to a combined tally of 24 for the other semi-finalists but has demonstrated that there is more to the game than simply heavy scoring.\n\n\"It seems like a common excuse that these players use against me,\" said Jones. \"They are supposed to be the best players in the world but they are moaning about being knocked out of their rhythm. They just can't accept it. It's pathetic really, isn't it?\"\n\nJones was also criticised by the six-times world champion Steve Davis for not heading straight for the practice table during the afternoon interval after losing the first four frames.\n\n\"He's been sitting in his chair,\" Davis said. \"Why would you not go to the practice table? It's a no-brainer to me.\"\n\nHendry was also blunt in assessing the overall tournament standard at a time when there is talk of quadrupling the \u00a3500,000 first prize by moving the event to Saudi Arabia or China. \"The absence of the real top players, the new world number one [Mark Allen], Ronnie, Judd, [Mark] Selby, [Mark] Williams, all these players who have been dominating snooker these last few years....

The 30-year-old - playing in his first ever ranking final - did at least manage to win the eighth frame with a break of 65, celebrating with an ironic punch in the air.\n\nBut his performance has been slammed by six-time world champion Steve Davis, who was baffled that while Wilson dominated, Jones didn't go to the practice table. \"He's been sitting in his chair for four frames. Why would you not go to the practice table?\" a bemused Davis asked on the BBC.\n\n\"I don't understand why not. He's absolutely not even got out of the blocks, and he's expecting to pot what could be difficult shots. It's a no-brainer to me to go to the practice table.\"\n\nAnother former world campion, Ken Doherty, was more sympathetic towards Jones, saying during Sunday's opening session: \"I feel terribly sorry for him at the moment he looks bereft of confidence, cutting a very lonely figure out there.\n\n\"And it does become embarrassing at times because you are expecting so much. He just hasn't performed. He is a bit like a rabbit in the headlights. He needs a frame. Just one frame, one frame out of this session. At least he can derive something from this. But at the moment he looks like a lost sheep.\"\n\nYour turn! Should Jak Jones have gone to the practice table? Give us your verdict in the comments section\n\nKyren Wilson strutted his stuff against Jak Jones\n\nIn contrast, Wilson enjoyed a tremendous start, getting underway by compiling the first century break in the opening frame of a Crucible final since Stephen Hendry managed a whopping 136 against White in 1993. Wilson then managed 129 clearance, taking complete control with further breaks of 52, 66, 62, 90 and another century.\n\nIt was a better evening session for Jones getting himself into the match at 10-5, although fears the damage has already been done remain. Wilson is hoping to avenge his defeat to Ronnie O'Sullivan in the 2020 final, having also finished as the runner-up at the 2018 Masters.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

After play restarted, Jones took the frame to reduce the deficit to 13-10, only for Wilson to then open his lead back up.\n\nPaul Collier, who was refereeing the frame, instructed Jones to briefly pause while the spectator was attended to. The players were given an extended break at the end of the frame before play could resume, as staff helped clear up the mess.\n\nJones had trailed 7-0 at one point in the final, while the second day's play began with Wilson 11-6 to the good. Jones had chances to bring the score even closer, but instead his opponent reeled off successive frames to make it 15-10.\n\nDuring the BBC's coverage, pundit John Parrott joked that \"That's the biggest cheer for a cleaner you will ever see\". The ill spectator was taken out of the venue before play continued, per The Sun.\n\nJones' recovery after his nightmare start came despite questions from pundits. \"He's been sitting in his chair for four frames. Why would you not go to the practice table?\" Steve Davis asked on The BBC.\n\n\"I don't understand why not. He's absolutely not even got out of the blocks, and he's expecting to pot what could be difficult shots. It's a no-brainer to me to go to the practice table.\"\n\nHave you seen anything like that at the snooker? Have your say in the comments section\n\nWilson ended the session in the lead\n\nDuring the BBC's coverage after the 25th frame, it was pointed out that Jones has played more than 20 hours' more snooker than his opponent. The man from Cwmbran is vying to become the first qualifier to go all the way since Shaun Murphy in 2005.\n\nThose in the studio suggested exhaustion might have been getting to both players late on. Jones and Wilson both missed presentable chances in the final frame of the session before Wilson got over the line.\n\n\"Both of them are on the floor,\" Davis said. \"You count to 10 and who can get up before the 10. They've been really, really nervous. You can feel for both of them but somebody has to make the last mistake.\"\n\n\"The pair of them are running on fumes,\" was Parrott's verdict.

However, that led to a further six-minute delay to the 24th frame getting underway.\n\nBBC presenter Hazel Irvine clarified the reason for the delay to viewers at home, with pundits John Parrott and Steve Davis left tickled by the crowd's reaction. \"That's the biggest cheer for a cleaner you will ever see,\" joked Parrott.\n\nThe final, which started on Sunday, is now heading into its final session, with Wilson leading 15-10.

The 30-year-old - playing in his first ever ranking final - did at least manage to win the eighth frame with a break of 65, celebrating with an ironic punch in the air.\n\nBut his performance has been slammed by six-time world champion Steve Davis, who was baffled that while Wilson dominated, Jones didn't go to the practice table. \"He's been sitting in his chair for four frames. Why would you not go to the practice table?\" a bemused Davis asked on the BBC.\n\n\"I don't understand why not. He's absolutely not even got out of the blocks, and he's expecting to pot what could be difficult shots. It's a no-brainer to me to go to the practice table.\"\n\nAnother former world campion, Ken Doherty, was more sympathetic towards Jones, saying during Sunday's opening session: \"I feel terribly sorry for him at the moment he looks bereft of confidence, cutting a very lonely figure out there.\n\n\"And it does become embarrassing at times because you are expecting so much. He just hasn't performed. He is a bit like a rabbit in the headlights. He needs a frame. Just one frame, one frame out of this session. At least he can derive something from this. But at the moment he looks like a lost sheep.\"\n\nYour turn! Should Jak Jones have gone to the practice table? Give us your verdict in the comments section\n\nIn contrast, Wilson enjoyed a tremendous start, getting underway by compiling the first century break in the opening frame of a Crucible final since Stephen Hendry managed a whopping 136 against White in 1993. Wilson then managed 129 clearance, taking complete control with further breaks of 52, 66, 62, 90 and another century.\n\nAt that point, there were discussions as to whether the best-of-35 clash would even reach the final session on Monday night. But Jones put together a stirring comeback winning the evening session to secure an overnight score of 11-6.\n\nWilson goes into Monday hoping to avenge his defeat to Ronnie O'Sullivan in the 2020 final, having also finished as the runner-up at the 2018 Masters.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Wilson stormed into a 7-0 lead during the opening session, before Jones mounted a mini fightback but he is still five frames behind and requires an almighty turnaround to come out on top.\n\nWhile the duo might argue the prestige of the event exceeds the prize money, the bonus for the winner is a sizeable one. More than \u00a32million is distributed to players across the tournament, with even \u00a320,000 going home to those that exited the tournament in the first round.\n\nOne of Wilson or Jones will cash in on \u00a3500,000 for winning the event, the largest cash prize on offer during the World Snooker Tour. The runner-up will have to settle for \u00a3200,000, which is no mean feat considering both players sat outside the top 10 in the world going into the tournament.\n\nJones, world no.44, has never been in the final of a ranking tournament and had to come through qualifying to even make the main draw. He has since beaten Zhang Anda, Si Jiahui, Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham to reach the final.\n\nAccording to CueTracker, the 30-year-old had banked just over \u00a3377,000 in career earnings before the tournament had began. Should Jones complete a famous comeback, he will pocket more in one event than he has in the 14 years since turning professional - a truly remarkable statistic.\n\nAs for Wilson, who previously reached the final in 2020 before losing to Ronnie O'Sullivan, he has reportedly earned around \u00a32.8m during his snooker career, but victory would put him among the elite. Wilson, world no.12, beat David Gilbert 17-11 to clinch his place in his second World Championship final.\n\nThe winner of the tournament could even bank \u00a3547,500 overall. Any player who makes a maximum 147 break at the Crucible will take home the bonus of an additional \u00a340,000. So far during the 2024 tournament, Noppon Saengkham is only player to achieve that feat despite not making it through qualifying.\n\nSaenghkam therefore still holds the marker for the highest break at the event, which would bring in an additional \u00a315,000 in prize money. However, if Wilson or Jones could muster up a magical 147 during the final, either would pick up half of the prize (\u00a37,500), with the amount being halved over than doubled.\n\nLuca Brecel stormed to victory in the 2023 World Championship final, beating four-time winner Mark Selby to claim the maximum prize money.

I don't understand why not.\n\n\"He's absolutely not even got out of the blocks, and he's expecting to pot what could be difficult shots. It's a no-brainer to me to go to the practice table.\"\n\nBesides Taylor's poor start against Davis, the only other time a player has lost the first seven frames of a Crucible final was in 1991, when Jimmy White fell 7-0 behind against John Parrott.\n\nAnd Jones may take some solace from the fact that Taylor hauled back his deficit to within one over the next nine frames, before going on to complete his famous black ball triumph the following night.\n\nEarlier, Jones, who had fought through two rounds of qualifying, accused some of his opponents of making excuses for their defeats by blaming his attritional style of play.\n\nBoth Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham, whom Jones beat in the quarter-finals and the last four respectively, said it had been hard to find their rhythm against a player ranked the second slowest in this year's Crucible main draw.\n\n\"It seems like a common excuse that these players use against me,\" said Jones. \"They are supposed to be the best players in the world but they are moaning about being knocked out of their rhythm.\n\n\"They just can't accept it.

The 30-year-old from Cwmbran is ranked 44th in the world and was a qualifier for the tournament, but has seen off former champions Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham to reach the final.\n\nGoing into the final day, Jones trailed 11-6 to Wilson, having gone 7-0 down before fighting back in Sunday's evening session. The final is the best of 35 frames, meaning the first player to reach 18 will be crowned champion.\n\nREAD MORE: World snooker final nightmare unfolds for Jak Jones as he's demolished in opening session\n\nREAD MORE: World snooker finalist Jak Jones slams 'pathetic' opponents after accusations\n\nWhatever happens, Jones has already secured by the far the biggest individual paycheck he has ever received at a tournament, having never reached a final of any competition before in his career. Before this year's World Championship, he had only reached the semi-final of a tournament once before.\n\nOf course, he could walk away from the Crucible with even more if he can pull off an incredible fightback on Monday. Here's what the finalists and winner of this year's World Snooker Championship stand to pocket.\n\n2024 World Snooker Championship prize money breakdown\n\nThe total prize pot for this year's tournament is \u00a32.4 million, which is distributed to players across the tournament. Those who crash out in the first qualifying round still take home \u00a35,000, while qualifyers who made it through pocket at least \u00a332,000.\n\nOf course, the further you go in the tournament, the far greater the rewards with some eye-watering sums reserved for those who make it through to the final stages.\n\nThe winner takes home a staggering \u00a3500,000 as well as the World Championship title. However, the losing finalist certainly doesn't go home empty handed, banking \u00a3200,000 for their efforts.\n\nHere's the full breakdown of how the prize pot is distributed.\n\nWinner - \u00a3500,000 Runner-up - \u00a3200,000 Semi-finalists - \u00a3100,000 Quarter-finalists - \u00a350,000 Last 16 - \u00a330,000 Last 32 - \u00a320,000\n\nQualifying rounds\n\nLast 48 - \u00a315,000 Last 80 - \u00a310,000 Last 112 - \u00a35,000 2024 World Snooker Championship bonuses\n\nThe player who makes the highest break at this year's World Championship will receive a bonus of \u00a315,000.\n\nIf anyone can make a maximum break of 147 at the Crucible, their bonus will increase to \u00a340,000, with Thailand's Noppon Saengkham the only player to achieve that feat despite not making it through qualifying.\n\nThere is an additional bonus of \u00a3147,000 on offer to any player who is able to make two maximums across the three Triple Crown events -- the World Championship, the UK Championship and the Masters -- during the same season\n\nJak Jones' career earnings\n\nBy qualifying for the semi-finals, Jones had already secured the largest single amount of prize money of his career but will now completely eclipse it after making it through to the final.\n\nEven if he loses to Wilson, he will still bank \u00a3200,000 - four times the largest single cheque he had won ahead of this year's tournament. The \u00a350,000 prize he took home from last year's quarter-finals was by far the biggest of his career at that point.\n\nHowever, Jones hasn't done too badly for himself over the years, taking home around \u00a3380,000 in prize money over the course of his nine seasons as a professional - excluding his current World Championship winnings - according to CueTracker\n\nThat means, if he is able to turn things around in the final and beat Wilson, he will make more money from one game than in the rest of his career combined.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_jones@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "John Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jak Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Bingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Bingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noppon_Saengkham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noppon Saengkham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maximum break"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29120408.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cazoo-World-Snooker-Championship-2024-Day-Sixteen-The-Crucible.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Jones has enjoyed an impressive run this year, knocking out Zhang Anda, Si Jiahui, Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham to secure his spot in the championship match.\n\nDespite his winning streak, Jones has faced backlash for his slower pace of play, which has been called out by both Trump and Bingham. But the world number 44 isn't having any of it, staunchly defending his strategy and dismissing the notion that it's affecting his rivals' game, via the Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE: World Snooker Champs referee apologises over costly 'lesson learnt' in final frame drama\n\nREAD MORE: 'I lost most epic World Snooker final ever - some stupid fans say it was fixed'\n\n\"They just can't accept it. I mean it's pathetic really, isn't it? Just accept it,\" Jones told SportsBoom. \"Against Judd [it] wasn't great. I noticed I couldn't believe the way he was playing against me. From when I went three up, he just completely changed as a player. I don't know if it's confidence or what.\n\n\"I was prepared to go into that match playing attacking, and I thought he started that way, but then to say I knocked him out of his rhythm, I don't get it.\n\nWhat do you think about the criticism of Jones' style of play? Tell us in the comments section below\n\nDespite facing criticism, Jones remains steadfast in his belief that his style of play isn't as negative as it's being portrayed. He refused to bow down as he prepared to face Wilson in the final.\n\n\"That doesn't affect me,\" he added. \"There's been matches where I've played slow, but when I play slow, I get bogged down. But when I don't feel like I was playing like that, I just won't accept it.\"\n\nWilson has made it to the final after a 17-11 victory over David Gilbert and is confident about winning the World Championship for the first time in his career.

He's shown what a good all-round player he is.\n\n\"I feel like I can handle any situation really. Especially when you're playing someone like John Higgins who has the best all-round game that I've ever seen and had to compete with.\n\n\"If you can take someone apart like that and he can come off and say such kind words.

And Walker said: \"He's under pressure tonight, but he'll come out and give it absolutely everything.\"\n\nJones, though, screwed his face up into a grimace and shook his head, as though he was dismissing the notion of \"pressure\", and it perhaps served to spark the 30-year-old into life.\n\nThe Cwmbran native won the first two frame of the evening session to get it back to 7-3 and impressed further as he took the match to 10-6. An important final frame on Sunday night came down to the black, with both players having chances to win it. But it was Wilson who clinched it and he now heads into Monday's finale with a strong 11-6 lead.\n\nJones said to the BBC after the evening session on Sunday night: \"It's a miracle I'm still in it.

Obviously target achieved.'\n\nSeven-time world champion Hendry was not sure why Wilson would only be aiming to win four of the nine frames on Sunday evening, saying that if he had opened up such a big lead in the afternoon he would have been targeting something similar in the next session.\n\n'Strange one for me,' said Hendry. 'If you're 7-1 up, why do you want to lose the next session and be only on 11? If I'm 7-1 up I want to press ahead and win the match as quickly as possible.\n\n'But before the start of day you'd definitely take the score, without a doubt. But having a 7-1 lead I'd be wanting to keep my foot hard on the pedal. But he'll be delighted with winning that last frame.'\n\nHendry felt the brilliant last frame was pivotal in the match, with the painful loss of it likely to end Jones' chances of a remarkable comeback.\n\n'I tend to think that might be his World Championship gone, losing that frame,' said the Scot. 'A five-frame lead going into day two is big. But he's won this session, he can win another one.'\n\nHendry did give full credit to the world number 44 for bouncing back from a morale-sapping first session and feels there is still some hope for him if he can start Monday afternoon impressively.\n\n'Stunning. That's more impressive than anything he's done in the championship so far, tonight,' Hendry said of Jones on Sunday evening. 'To even bring this ginal alive, to make it a final, because it was dead after the afternoon session, to be honest.\n\n'But he's brought it alive and wow, the first two frames tomorrow afternoon are monster frames. If he loses them it's all over so he's got to get like a coiled spring tomorrow afternoon and win those first two frames.'\n\nThe final two sessions of the 2024 World Snooker Championship are played at 1pm and 7pm on Monday.\n\nMORE : Jak Jones battles back against Kyren Wilson into Crucible final contention", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_haigh@metro.co.uk", "name": "Phil Haigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hendry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Hendry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jak Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151607211.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=60px%2C52px%2C936px%2C492px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The world No. 44 will face Kyren Wilson, who defeated David Gilbert 17-11, in the two-day final that gets underway on Sunday.\n\nOnly twice in the past has a qualifier won the World Championship: Terry Griffiths in 1979 and a young Shaun Murphy in 2005.\n\nAfter reaching the quarterfinals in his maiden event the previous year, Jones had another fantastic event. To advance to the title match, he overcame Si Jiahui, Judd Trump, and Zhang Anda before he met Stuart Bingham to reach the final.\n\nNow that snooker fans keep their eyes at the World Snooker Championship finalists, let us have a look at who Jak Jones is, ahead of the final.\n\nJak Jones is a Welsh snooker player who waw born on July 29, 1993 in Cwmbran, Wales. The 30-year-old is also known as The Silent Assassin. He is currently ranked 44th in the world.\n\nJones has nine siblings, one sister and eight brothers and his parents Colin and Debbie have made great sacrifices to help him reach the pinnacle of the sport. His dad travelled the globe to watch his son play while his mum is also a huge supporter.\n\nHe will bank atleast \u00a3200,000 for the Snooker World Championship after making it to the final. Before this year's tournament, the \u00a350,000 cheque from last year's quarter-finals was the biggest of his career. He has won \u00a3380,000 in prize money over the course of his nine seasons as a professional apart from his world championship earnings with his net worth standing at 500,000-1 million pounds.\n\nJak Jones turned professional in 2010 at the age of 16, having won the 2010 European Under-19 Snooker Championship in Malta. In 2010 he made his professional debut, winning the European Under-19 Snooker Championships with a 6-4 victory over Anthony McGill.\n\nThrough the EBSA Qualifying Tour play-offs, he was able to regain his card in 2013. He was able to do so again in 2016 following his 7-4 victory over Jamie Clarke to win the European Championship in Poland.\n\nMost recently, in 2018, he retained his tour berth after making it through Q School Event One.\n\nHe finished his debut season ranked 94th in the world and was relegated from the circuit for not placing in the top 64. He made his debut at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield and advanced to the quarterfinals before becoming well-known at the 2023 World Championship.\n\nHe then reached the round of eight before losing to Mark Allen after defeating Ali Carter and former world champion Neil Robertson. Prior to this, he had defeated Robbie Williams, Barry Hawkins, and Adam Duffy to qualify for the competition.

Why would you not go to the practice table?\n\n\"I don't understand why not. He's absolutely not even got out of the blocks, and he's expecting to pot what could be difficult shots.\n\n\"It's a no-brainer to me to go to the practice table.\"\n\nJones, who prepares for matches with a Nando's meal, wants to become the third qualifier to win the Crucible crown and he reckons the longer format suits his character.\n\nHis wife Inna is a Russian law student - they met five years ago in Riga, Latvia - but she has spent most of the tournament watching it on TV back home with his mum Debbie.\n\nThe Silent Assassin has nine siblings and has had to sort out lots of tickets for the showpiece occasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones thinks it is \"pathetic\" when top players complain that his slow play affects their own rhythm.\n\nHe is one of the slowest snooker stars on tour and after he beat Judd Trump in the quarter-finals, the world No.2 moaned \"it was a little bit slower than I'd have liked\".\n\nThe Cwmbran cueist said: \"I think they'll probably always use that excuse forever. A common excuse that these players use against me.\n\n\"They are supposed to be the best players in the world, yet they're moaning about being knocked out of their rhythm. It seems strange to me.\n\n\"It doesn't bother me. When I played Judd, he started off typically like Judd with a century in the first frame and I came back at him to go 3-1 up.\n\n\"I just noticed a complete change in his body language. He seemed to be taking forever on every shot compared to what he usually does.\n\n\"So it's easy to blame what I am doing or whatever but it's working, so I will take it.\n\n\"They cannot accept it. It's pathetic really isn't it? Just accept it.\n\n\"My natural game is quite fast I think. Other players in the top 16, not saying names, I regularly see go down to the late 20 seconds.\n\n\"But they always have to say that after they lose against me.\n\n\"The worst thing is I notice it when I play against them, I feel they want to play that game. It's just an excuse.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_maul@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Rob Maul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jak Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Parrott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Parrott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitewash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hendry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Hendry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judd Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cwmbran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cwmbran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cwmbran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riga", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jak-jones-wales-reacts-final-899121485.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

'When I got to 16 I looked up and saw it was best of 33, I didn't really know. You lose what day it is!\n\n'I've had lots of people helping me. I've been working with a solution hypnotherapist called Chris O'Connor, something we just started before the World Championship.\n\n'He's been helping me with the sleep, he's just been knocking me out basically, I slept eight-and-a-half hours last night. God help me when I get home and I've got to deal with the kids again!\n\n'We've been speaking pretty much every single day, which I thank him for taking his time out and doing that for me, with a busy schedule.\n\n'It's just about emptying your stress bucket, if that makes sense. We all have things going on that can affect our day-to-day working lives. It's allowed me to go out there and be a bit freer.'\n\nThe clash with Gilbert was tight through the first two sessions, level at 4-4 and then 8-8, but Wilson took control on Friday night and pushed over the line on Saturday afternoon.\n\n'Dave had every right to be beating me in that match as well,' he said. 'Dave's a classy cueist, hits the ball unbelievably well and I've got to stop him getting into his stride.\n\n'I felt like I broke the back of the match yesterday. I was obviously just very focussed on hitting home the advantage.\n\n'I had some good form in that game, some nice slices of luck at the right times. It's not something I've had all season long. You keep saying it's going to turn and in the World Championship, the long-format matches, it is swings and roundabouts, it's just about being patient.'\n\nWilson is into his second World Championship final, having lost to Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2020, and he has learned a simple lesson from that experience.\n\n'Don't eat too much pizza and have too many Peronis the night before!' Wilson said. 'I woke up so tired that morning, fire alarm went off in the hotel the morning of the final, I only had three hours sleep.\n\n'It's hard enough playing him as it is let alone with stuff like that going on.

If you can take someone apart like that and he says such kind words, it fills you with belief.\"\n\nA victory for Wilson in the final would lift him up to third in the world rankings and allow him to collect the \u00a3500,000 top prize, while Jones would climb from 44th to sixth.\n\nPrior to Sunday, only eight qualifiers have previously reached the World Championship final at the Crucible.\n\nCanada's Cliff Thorburn was the first in 1977, while China's Ding Junhui was the most recent in 2016.\n\nHowever, Jones now has the opportunity to emulate fellow Welshman Terry Griffiths (1979) and England's Shaun Murphy (2005) after coming into the tournament as a 200-1 outsider.\n\nWhile he expects his law student wife Inna, who he met while playing in the Riga Masters in Latvia, to attend what will remarkably be his first ever appearance in a ranking final, he is unsure whether his mother will also make the journey because of nerves.\n\n\"She might come up to wash my shirts or something, like she did for the previous match,\" Jones said.\n\n\"She stayed up a couple of nights back, washed my shirts and went home the next morning. She can't watch it live. She'll watch it back if I've won afterwards.\n\n\"She has never been able to watch. Me and my dad have always gone around together and nobody else has ever really come.\"\n\nJones, 30, who is nicknamed the Silent Assassin, turned professional in 2010 and first competed against Wilson at Q School 13 years ago.\n\nHowever, his journey to the brink of a world title has included plenty of setbacks, including dropping off the main tour.\n\n\"Because I have had so much disappointment in my career so far, I don't get too excited,\" he added.\n\n\"When I win it feels just like job done because it is what I have been practising for all my life. It doesn't feel as good as it should do, maybe.\"\n\nWilson and his young family had have other challenging issues to deal with over the last 12-18 months.\n\nHis wife Sophie had a stroke and has been diagnosed with epilepsy, while his eldest son Bailey has also suffered with illness and also had to have an operation after an accident at school.\n\nBack at the table, Wilson says he has benefited hugely from enlisting the help of a hypnotherapist.\n\n\"It is about emptying your stress bucket. We all have things that can affect your daily life and it has just allowed me to go out and be that little bit freer,\" he explained.\n\n\"Our minds are so clogged up and filled with so many different things that don't need to be there, so if you can eliminate them and just play snooker it makes the game a lot easier.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old, who admits that he drank too much beer and ate too much pizza the night before losing to O'Sullivan four years ago, says he is hopeful he can convince his youngest son Finley that he is just as successful as the footballer he idolises, Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\"Hopefully I have overtaken Ronaldo. Roy Keane [the former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland captain] was here on Friday watching me play,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"Finley decided to go up and ask him for a photo and said 'Is it true you used to play with Ronaldo?'

Twelve months ago, carefree Belgian potter Luca Brecel struck a blow for Continental Europe but this time the winner will come from two of the game's dominant forces: England and Wales. From John Spencer (1977) and Ray Reardon (1978), the winners of the first two editions at the Crucible, English and Welsh players have peppered us with iconic memories at the world championship. Those multiple victories for Ronnie O'Sullivan, Steve Davis and Mark Selby, Jimmy White's continuous heartbreak, Reardon's asides to the crowd, Doug Mountjoy's frilly red shirts, Terry Griffiths' revelation that \"I'm in the final now, you know\" before winning as a qualifier...\n\nAh, yes, winning as a qualifier. That's what Jak Jones is also trying to achieve this week after a gutsy run to the final that took him past Zhang Anda, Si Jiahui, Judd Trump and Stuart Bingham, the latter two both former world champions. It seemed as if Jones had woken up during a bad dream when England's Kyren Wilson opened with a century and raced into an eyepopping 7-0 lead on day one. But if there's one thing we know about Jones it's that he doesn't lie down easily. From an ironic raised fist to the crowd after putting his first frame on the board, the 30-year-old from Cwmbran won the second session 5-4 to limit Wilson's overnight lead to 11-6.\n\nThat doesn't tell the whole story though. Jones looked on the brink of hitting his pillow at just 10-7 down when compiling a 64 break in the final frame of the day, leaving Wilson needing a snooker.

And he is ready to realise a boyhood dream and banish the pain of being crushed by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the 2020 final after joining forces with a hypnotherapist.\n\n\"It's like groundhog day,\" admitted Wilson, who missed fellow potter Oliver Brown's wedding day as he reached a second Crucible final. \"It's such a long tournament, you lose what day it is.

If you can eliminate them and focus only on your snooker it makes the game a hell of a lot easier. I've had some great sleep this tournament, he's been knocking me right out.\"\n\nWilson was the only seed left in the event come the semi-finals - something that has not happened since way back in 1977. The five-time ranking-event winner had reached just one semi-final all season and is now the favourite to scoop the \u00a3500,000 top prize.\n\n\"The Crucible is a different animal,\" added Wilson. \"I haven't had the best of seasons coming here and suddenly you get to the semi-finals and everyone's saying you're the favourite. I've got to handle that. I'm aware of it.\"\n\nHaving resumed 14-10 up, Wilson won three of the four frames to move a step closer to becoming world champion. Gilbert, a semi-finalist in 2019, came through two rounds of qualifying to reach the Crucible.\n\nBut he eventually ran out of steam as his dreams of becoming the first qualifier to lift the treasured trophy since Shaun Murphy 19 years ago went up in smoke.\n\nThe Angry Farmer, who punched himself during the 27th frame, reflected: \"It's a really disappointing way to go out because I thought I could win that game. There's nothing to feel too bad about.

The snooker star edging closer to ending major title drought", "body": "For Kyren Wilson, a maiden World Championship title could finally allow a man long tipped for a major title to fulfil the potential he has shown throughout his career.\n\nBorn in Kettering, the 32-year-old first turned professional in 2010 and soon established himself as one of snooker's brightest young stars, recovering from a loss of form and regaining his World Tour card to return to the top tier of the sport in 2013.\n\nWilson immediately made an impact, forging a reputation as a player who could beat anyone on his day as he built the consistency required to challenge at the highest level. By 2015, it had arrived -- at the Shanghai Masters, Wilson came all the way through qualifying to stun Judd Trump in the final and secure his first ranking title.\n\nHaving begun the event ranked outside the world's top 50, Wilson was the biggest outsider to claim a ranking event in a decade. A run to the quarter-finals of the 2016 World Championship was another indication of a player on the up.\n\nWhen he surged to the final of The Masters on his second appearance in 2018, it felt like confirmation of Wilson's ascent into snooker's upper echelons. But a 10-7 defeat to Mark Allen at Alexandra Palace represented a setback, the Englishman feeling that he had ceded the opportunity a little too easily. \"I just made things a bit too easy for Mark,\" a tearful Wilson reflected afterwards. \"You can't do that to a player of Mark's class, he's too good and he'll punish you. That's what he did tonight.\n\nDespite winning five ranking events to sit inside the top 20 on snooker's all-time list of victories, questions about his big-match mentality have followed Wilson, perhaps explaining why a Triple Crown title still eludes him. 'The Warrior' has reached the last eight at either The Masters, UK Championship or World Championship 14 times but contested only two finals - against snooker's elite players, he has typically struggled.\n\nA gutsy quarter-final win over Judd Trump at the Covid-delayed World Championship in 2020 suggested brighter times to come, particularly after a fluked green allowed Wilson to pip Anthony McGill in an all-time classic deciding frame in the semi-final. Yet he was unable to hold on to a rampant Rocket as Ronnie O'Sullivan claimed his sixth world title in dominant fashion.\n\nMight 2024 be the year that Wilson finally breaks through? It has been a strange season for the father-of-two, scoring freely at times but unable to put together a deep run at a tournament. Only Trump (79) has more than Wilson's 65 centuries across the campaign, but he has not even a final appearance to show for it.\n\nThe Crucible could offer salvation. All of the top seeds have fallen, leaving Wilson, 12th in the world, strangely placed as the highest-ranked player left standing by the semi-finals. He will sense an opportunity.\n\nAfter beating David Gilbert in the semi-finals, Wilson revealed he has been benefiting from sessions with a hypnotherapist during his run to the final. \"It's just about emptying your stress bucket,\" said Wilson. \"We all have things going on that can affect our day-to-day life and it allowed me to go out there and be a little bit freer.\n\n\"Our minds are so clogged up with so many different things that don't need to be there, so if you can just eliminate them and go out and play snooker it makes the game a hell of a lot easier.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Masters_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Masters (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masters (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Allen_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Allen (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kettering"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kettering"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UK Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandra Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_McGill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony McGill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilbert_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Gilbert (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O'Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie O'Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crucible"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/24/13/aa2b89081662eb45fcb6816bb7fee5c2Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE0MDQ4NzA5-2.75975112.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539882", "eventUri": "eng-9539882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

After a tense final, which he led from start to finish, the 32-year-old from Kettering held off the most stirring renaissance from qualifier Jak Jones before balling his eyes out with his family.\n\nWith the match on a knife-edge, Jones had fought back from 7-1, 15-10 and 17-11 down to run the contest deep into its final session but no one could attest that a nervy Wilson did not deserve his victory. The world No 12 was the only member of the top-16 ranked players to progress beyond the semi-finals at this year's tournament and ultimately led the world No 44 from Sunday's start to Monday's finish.\n\nNicknamed the warrior, Wilson distilled that spirit to avenge his 2020 humbling by Ronnie O'Sullivan at the same stage, battling both the stress of nerves and the recent health issues of his wife and son. It was not so much a win against the odds given that Wilson was the favourite against the Welshman, who had to play in the qualifying rounds, but not even the most curmudgeon of neutrals could begrudge the Englishman his victory in this best-of-35 tussle.\n\nNot that Wilson's win was without its jitters. At 17-12, Jones went 96 points towards a maximum 147 break before missing a tough red and, in the match's most anxious frame, with Wilson leading 16-11, the Englishman snookered himself behind the brown having earlier fouled on the pink. As Jones cleared up, the black was re-spotted; the Welshman missed a sitter, and Wilson went off three cushions to seal the frame and leave himself one away from the title.\n\nBut it took the Englishman some time to seal it. As much as Wilson merited the trophy, Jones deserves acclaim for the way in which he stuck in the fight, thrice pegging Wilson back to a three-frame lead, and on Monday evening hitting his first century break of the showpiece as he ruffled the Englishman's feathers. Jones's gumption was unquestionable but the damage was done during Sunday's first session. Miraculous comebacks are seldom seen at this stage in the Crucible and overturning a six-frame deficit would have mathematically been second only to Dennis Taylor's 1985 revival against Steve Davis. Philosophically, however, given Jones's status - a qualifier, ranked 44th in the world - it would have eclipsed Taylor's 8-0 turnaround, with Wilson on Sunday only the third player in Crucible history to win the opening seven frames of a final.\n\nNotwithstanding Monday's result, there was always going to be a new face to those of previous winners lining Sheffield's Surrey Street. For the first time since 2005, two new challengers contested the final but it was Wilson's big-game experience in the face of nervy adversity - the Englishman has played in four Crucible semi-finals to Jones's one - which allowed him to keep the Welshman at arm's length throughout.\n\nThe man from Cwmbran started Monday's play channelling Lazarus, cutting what was once a six-frame chasm down to three. But the peripeteia came at 13-10, with two frames to play before the final session. Had Jones emerged triumphant from that duo, he would have been within one frame of completing the most staggering of revivals. As it happened, Wilson battled puke - an audience member was taken ill during the 23rd frame - and a Jones fluke to put a few fingers on the trophy. Just three frames would be required in the final's fabled evening session; Jones, meanwhile, who had already complained of fatigue - he has spent 22 more hours at the table than Wilson across the championship - needed eight. A 15-10 cushion was enough for Wilson with the pressure piling.\n\nThe agony for Jones was that, despite drawing Monday's opening session, it felt like his afternoon. Wilson lost composure in the crucial 25th frame, blasting what would have been the clinching red to Rotherham, but the Welshman could not capitalise, at one stage slashing his cue through the air in disgust. Despite the evening nerves, that felt like the match - and so it proved. Certainly, the punters in the environs of the Crucible agreed, with one or two miffed that they might not be recouping the full value of their tickets for the evening session.\n\nIn the end, they got their money's worth.

After a tense final, which he led from start to finish, the 32-year-old from Kettering held off the most stirring renaissance from qualifier Jak Jones before balling his eyes out with his family.\n\nWith the match on a knife-edge, Jones had fought back from 7-1, 15-10 and 17-11 down to run the contest deep into its final session but no one could attest that a nervy Wilson did not deserve his victory. The world No 12 was the only member of the top-16 ranked players to progress beyond the semi-finals at this year's tournament and ultimately led the world No 44 from Sunday's start to Monday's finish.\n\nNicknamed the warrior, Wilson distilled that spirit to avenge his 2020 humbling by Ronnie O'Sullivan at the same stage, battling both the stress of nerves and the recent health issues of his wife and son. It was not so much a win against the odds given that Wilson was the favourite against the Welshman, who had to play in the qualifying rounds, but not even the most curmudgeon of neutrals could begrudge the Englishman his victory in this best-of-35 tussle.\n\nNot that Wilson's win was without its jitters. At 17-12, Jones went 96 points towards a maximum 147 break before missing a tough red and, in the match's most anxious frame, with Wilson leading 16-11, the Englishman snookered himself behind the brown having earlier fouled on the pink. As Jones cleared up, the black was re-spotted; the Welshman missed a sitter, and Wilson went off three cushions to seal the frame and leave himself one away from the title.\n\nBut it took the Englishman some time to seal it. As much as Wilson merited the trophy, Jones deserves acclaim for the way in which he stuck in the fight, thrice pegging Wilson back to a three-frame lead, and on Monday evening hitting his first century break of the showpiece as he ruffled the Englishman's feathers. Jones's gumption was unquestionable but the damage was done during Sunday's first session. Miraculous comebacks are seldom seen at this stage in the Crucible and overturning a six-frame deficit would have mathematically been second only to Dennis Taylor's 1985 revival against Steve Davis. Philosophically, however, given Jones's status - a qualifier, ranked 44th in the world - it would have eclipsed Taylor's 8-0 turnaround, with Wilson on Sunday only the third player in Crucible history to win the opening seven frames of a final.\n\nNotwithstanding Monday's result, there was always going to be a new face to those of previous winners lining Sheffield's Surrey Street. For the first time since 2005, two new challengers contested the final but it was Wilson's big-game experience in the face of nervy adversity - the Englishman has played in four Crucible semi-finals to Jones's one - which allowed him to keep the Welshman at arm's length throughout.\n\nThe man from Cwmbran started Monday's play channelling Lazarus, cutting what was once a six-frame chasm down to three. But the peripeteia came at 13-10, with two frames to play before the final session. Had Jones emerged triumphant from that duo, he would have been within one frame of completing the most staggering of revivals. As it happened, Wilson battled puke - an audience member was taken ill during the 23rd frame - and a Jones fluke to put a few fingers on the trophy. Just three frames would be required in the final's fabled evening session; Jones, meanwhile, who had already complained of fatigue - he has spent 22 more hours at the table than Wilson across the championship - needed eight. A 15-10 cushion was enough for Wilson with the pressure piling.\n\nThe agony for Jones was that, despite drawing Monday's opening session, it felt like his afternoon. Wilson lost composure in the crucial 25th frame, blasting what would have been the clinching red to Rotherham, but the Welshman could not capitalise, at one stage slashing his cue through the air in disgust. Despite the evening nerves, that felt like the match - and so it proved. Certainly, the punters in the environs of the Crucible agreed, with one or two miffed that they might not be recouping the full value of their tickets for the evening session.\n\nIn the end, they got their money's worth. The Englishman limped to within a frame of victory with his round-the-houses, re-spotted black but the Welshman would not lay down, his perfect 12 reds keeping him in the hunt at 17-13.

Score, result from Kryen Wilson vs Jak Jones in Crucible final", "body": "The final of the 2024 World Snooker Championship saw Kyren Wilson and Jak Jones battle it out to win the sport's grandest prize for the first time in their careers.\n\nWilson, the runner-up at this event in 2020, enjoyed an impressive run to the final this year that included a quarterfinal win over John Higgins. The 32-year-old won every match before the final by at least five frames, suggesting he was in the right sort of form, and frame of mind, to become a Triple Crown winner for the first time.\n\nJones had never before reached the final of a ranking event. He enjoyed a fairy-tale run at the Crucible in 2024, defeating Judd Trump in the quarters and then Stuart Bingham, the conqueror of Ronnie O'Sullivan, in the semifinals. The 30-year-old Welshman came through qualifying to progress all the way to the title match.\n\nHere is how the final played out across two engrossing days in May.\n\nMORE: Who has won the most World Snooker Championship titles?\n\nKyren Wilson won the World Snooker Championship in 2024, defeating Jak Jones 18-14 in the final at the Crucible.\n\nWilson raced into a 7-0 lead and threatened to finish the job with a day to spare, but Jones, playing in his first major final, rallied superbly to make it a contest.\n\nThe Welshman pulled back to within three frames but was unable to sustain enough of a run to put enough pressure on Wilson, who eventually eased to success in front of a jubilant crowd in the final session on Monday.\n\nA deeply emotional Wilson, speaking after celebrating with his family, said: \"I'm trying so hard to inspire a younger generation. Hopefully, I'm inspiring my kids.\n\n\"They did an interview this week, and someone asked them who their sporting idol was. They said [Cristiano] Ronaldo.

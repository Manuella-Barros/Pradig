{"id": 243249750, "title": "Funeral of commentator Micheal O Muircheartaigh to take place in Kerry", "text": "The funeral of renowned Gaelic Games commentator Micheal O Muircheartaigh is to be held in Co Kerry on Saturday. Mr O Muircheartaigh died on Tuesday morning, aged 93, in a Dublin hospital, surrounded by family members. His funeral mass will be held at 11am at St Mary\u2019s Church in Dingle, Co Kerry before he is buried in St Brendan\u2019s Cemetery. The voice of the former RTE broadcaster from Co Kerry became synonymous with the GAA in Ireland during a career that spanned decades. A teacher before he joined RTE full-time in the 1980s, Mr O Muircheartaigh commentated in both the Irish and English languages. His life as a sports commentator began many years before taking on the job full time. President of Ireland Michael D Higgins said his commentaries captured \u201clike no other the sense of occasion, the atmosphere in the stadium and on the terraces, the ebb and flow of the play and of every movement\u201d. Since his death, people have been reminiscing on the one-liners that made his commentary so unique. Many have cited his description of Cork hurler and footballer Sean Og O hAilpin, about whom Mr O Muircheartaigh once remarked: \u201cHis father\u2019s from Fermanagh, his mother\u2019s from Fiji \u2013 neither a hurling stronghold.\u201d Another is: \u201cThe stopwatch has stopped. It\u2019s up to God and the referee now. The referee is Pat Horan. God is God.\u201d Mr O Muircheartaigh is survived by his wife Helena, his children Eamonn, Niamh, Aonghus, Cormac, Neasa, Nuala, Eadaoin and Doireann, and his grandchildren.", "summary": "His funeral mass will be held at St Mary\u2019s Church in Dingle.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/church-dublin-ireland-god-english-b1167594.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/29/02/0f01da18bbf04ca8d9427f907b51104cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE5Njk2MTU3-2.23379057.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:53:24", "author": "By Grinne N.

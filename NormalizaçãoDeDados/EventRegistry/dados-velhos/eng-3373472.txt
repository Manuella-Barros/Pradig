Sgt.

Howard remains hospitalized.\n\nMiller is the only one charged of three people the police questioned, the chief said.

(AP) -- A suspect in the fatal shooting of two police officers in Florida was arrested in a bar several hours after the attack, authorities said Saturday.\n\nEverett Miller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Officer Matthew Baxter, who died Friday night after the attack. Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon, and authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for that.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\n(Sgt. Sam Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter/Photo Courtesy: Kissimmee Police Department)\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, other two officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of his child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov.

Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon, and authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for that.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, other two officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of his child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov.

(Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP)\n\nKISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThey found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov.

Sgt. Sam Howard was also shot and is in grave condition, police said.\n\nThe shooting may have been an ambush, O'Dell said, as the officers responded to a suspicious activity call just before 9:30 pm Friday.

Howard remains hospitalized.\n\nMiller is the only one charged of three people the police questioned, the chief said. No other charges are expected, he said.\n\nFollowing the news of the shooting, President Donald Trump tweeted his condolences.\n\n\"My thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones. We are with you!\" the President said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott described Baxter as a husband, a father and a hero.\n\n\"Heartbroken to hear loss of @kissimmeepolice officer Matthew Baxter.

(AP) -- One police officer was killed and three wounded in nighttime shootings in two Florida cities where the officers were responding to suspected drug activity and reports of a suicide attempt, police said Saturday.\n\nOne officer was killed and another gravely injured late Friday night in Kissimmee in central Florida just south of the theme park hub of Orlando. The other two officers were injured a couple of hours later in Jacksonville, one of them shot in both hands and the other in the stomach. Three of four suspects in the Kissimmee shooting were arrested, and the shooter in Jacksonville was shot and killed when police returned fire.\n\nIn Kissimmee, officers Sam Howard and Matthew Baxter were checking suspects in an area of the city for drug activity when they were shot, Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said at a news conference. They did not have an opportunity to return fire.\n\n\"They were surprised,\" O'Dell said. When asked whether they were ambushed, he said, \"It's too early to tell, but it's leading that way.\"\n\nBaxter, a three-year veteran of the department, died later in a hospital and Howard, a 10-year veteran, was in serious condition, O'Dell said. Both had families, he said.\n\nThe officers were checking three of the suspects when a fourth opened fire. One of the original three suspects fled and was being sought, and the other three were arrested. Broadcaster WFTV showed aerial footage of police cars with lights flashing swarmed a housing complex as the search continued early Saturday morning.\n\nIn the northern Florida city of Jacksonville, police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where three other people were thought to be in danger, Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno said.\n\nA team of officers heard gunshots inside and feared \"an active shooter situation\" so they approached the house, Bruno said. The suspect then came out firing a high-powered rifle. He was shot and killed, and two of the police officers were wounded in the exchange of fire. The three other people in the house were safe, Bruno said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott sent Tweets about the four officers, saying \"we stand with ALL law enforcement in Florida.\"\n\nWhen O'Dell held his brief news conference outside the hospital where the two fallen Kissimmee officers had been taken, reports already had surfaced of two more officers shot in Jacksonville to the north.\n\n\"It's a tough time for law enforcement,\" O'Dell said of those reports. \"It's getting tough to do the job.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T07:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "07:06:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181844", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182155", "label": {"eng": "Orlando"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 5}, {"id": "303465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "score": 3}, {"id": "303472", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "score": 4}, {"id": "303778", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "score": 3}, {"id": "306136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "score": 4}, {"id": "311731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Dell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "score": 4}, {"id": "313180", "label": {"eng": "Central Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "330725", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "score": 1}, {"id": "354524", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WFTV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFTV", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "07:13:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "1 police officer killed, 3 injured in 2 shootings in Florida", "originalArticle": null}

Local 10 News reported that he was married to a fellow police officer at the Kissimmee Police Department and had three children. \"Tonight we lost a brave officer - Matthew Baxter. Husband/father/hero,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott wrote on Twitter. Sgt. Howard is also a husband and father, The Orlando Sentinel reported.\n\nBaxter and Howard responded to a call of suspicious persons in a downtown area. The shooting may have been an \"ambush,\" the chief said, and the officers did not return fire. Three suspects are reportedly in custody, and authorities are looking for one additional suspect.\n\nOsceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. said that the last time a Kissimmee police officer was killed on duty was in 1983. \"It's just awful. We're praying for the families of these officers and for the whole KPD family,\" he said.\n\nTwo officers were also reportedly shot 150 miles north of Kissimmee in Jacksonville, Florida. One was shot in the stomach and was in critical condition, while the other was shot in the hands and was in stable condition early Saturday morning. The officers were responding to a suicide call, according to Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno. They apparently arrived to find a man with a rifle, and three people barricaded in a room, The Florida Times-Union reported. More information, like whether the incidents were connected, was not immediately available\n\n\"This is a tough time in law enforcement. I would ask that you pray for the men and women of law enforcement,\" Chief O'Dell said.

Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, the police chief said.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller would be taken to jail wearing the fallen officer's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation show that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years.

State police say the troopers, both taken to hospitals after the Friday night shooting in Fairchance, were in stable condition.\n\nOne officer was killed and another gravely injured late Friday night in Kissimmee in central Florida just south of the theme park hub of Orlando. Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said at a news conference Saturday that a suspect, Everett Miller, was arrested several hours after the shootings.\n\nHe faces a first-degree murder charge. Authorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nThe other two officers were injured a couple of hours later in Jacksonville, one of them shot in both hands and the other in the stomach. The shooter in Jacksonville was shot and killed when police returned fire.\n\nIn Kissimmee, officers Sam Howard and Matthew Baxter were checking suspects in an area of the city for drug activity when they were shot, O'Dell said earlier. They did not have an opportunity to return fire.\n\n\"They were surprised,\" O'Dell said. When asked whether they were ambushed, he said, \"It's too early to tell, but it's leading that way.\"\n\nBaxter died later in a hospital and Howard was in serious condition, O'Dell said.\n\nO'Dell said Baxter was a three-year veteran and Howard is a 10-year veteran, CBS affiliate WKMG-TV reports. Both men are husbands and fathers.\n\n\"Right now, as you can imagine, (the families) are completely heartbroken and devastated,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe officers were checking three of the suspects when a fourth opened fire. One of the original three suspects fled and was later arrested. Broadcaster WFTV showed aerial footage of police cars with lights flashing swarmed a housing complex as the search continued early Saturday morning.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday about the shooting, posting \"we are with you!\"\n\nIn the northern Florida city of Jacksonville, police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where three other people were thought to be in danger, Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno said.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO) said on Twitter that two police officers were shot in the west side of the city. The officers were responding to an attempted suicide call, JSO Director Mike Bruno told CBS affiliate WJAX-TV.\n\nA team of officers heard gunshots inside and feared \"an active shooter situation\" so they approached the house, Bruno said. The suspect then came out firing a high-powered rifle. He was shot and killed, and two of the police officers were wounded in the exchange of fire. The three other people in the house were safe, Bruno said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted about both shootings, writing that he was \"heartbroken to hear of the loss\" of the Kissimmee officers. About Jacksonville, he wrote he was \"praying\" for the officers.\n\nWhen O'Dell held his brief news conference outside the hospital where the two fallen Kissimmee officers had been taken, reports already had surfaced of two more officers shot in Jacksonville to the north.\n\n\"It's a tough time for law enforcement,\" O'Dell said of those reports. \"It's getting tough to do the job.\"\n\nPolice in Pennsylvania told reporters Friday night that the encounter that injured two troopers took place outside a Stop 'n Save in Fairchance, a borough about 52 miles south of Pittsburgh.

His colleague, Officer Matthew Baxter, died Friday night after the attack in a neighborhood of Kissimmee, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando. (Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP)\n\nKISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- A suspect in the fatal shooting of two police officers in Florida was arrested in a bar several hours after the attack, authorities said Saturday.\n\nEverett Miller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Officer Matthew Baxter, who died Friday night after the attack. Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon, and authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for that.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years.

When police responded to reports of an \"active shooter situation\" where an attempted suicide took place in a house in Jacksonville, Florida, the suspect opened fire through the doorway and critically injured two officers, according to Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno. The suspect was shot and killed during the exchange.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R) tweeted late Friday, \"Our law enforcement officers are true heroes and we will miss these brave Floridians.\"\n\nAfter learning of the Jacksonville shooting, Scott issued a second tweet, saying, \"Just learned of two [Jacksonville officers] in danger tonight - we stand with ALL law enforcement in Florida.\"\n\nThe third shooting took place in Fairchance, Pennsylvania, at a Shop 'n Save store and left two officers injured, according to Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Melinda Bondarenka. The suspect died following the exchange of gunfire and both officers are expected to survive their injuries.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the shootings that occurred in our community and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families,\" Mark Burnworth Jr., Fairchance Shop 'n Save Assistant Store Manager, said in a statement, according to CBS Pittsburgh. \"We will continue to support the police department in their ongoing investigation. Providing a safe environment for our employees and guests is our number one concern.\"\n\n(photo credit, homepage and article images: Oxyman, Wikipedia)", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:50:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "13:50:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181844", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "195816", "label": {"eng": "Fairchance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchance,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairchance"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "score": 3}, {"id": "328794", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "330725", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "score": 2}, {"id": "360059", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Sheriff's Office"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Sheriff's_Office", "score": 2}], "image": "http://cdn.lifezette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kissimmee_Police_FL_USA_-_Ford_Crown_Victoria_Police_Interceptor_2280x840_acf_cropped-750x420.jpg", "timeCrawl": "22:29:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Trump Tells Kissimmee Police, 'We Are with You' After Lethal Shootout", "originalArticle": null}

(AP) -- A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThey found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nIn a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was \"heartbroken\" by the attacks on the officers.\n\nU.S. Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.\n\nThe officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek the death penalty, explaining it's not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims' relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ayala didn't respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:24:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time":

The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSergeant Sam Howard died today afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following last night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died last night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late yesterday of a neighbourhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire.\n\nThey weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighbouring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him.\n\nMiller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said. They found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said today that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\" Separately, two other officers were injured late yesterday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said today that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following last night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh last night.\n\nIn a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early today that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott tweeted he was \"heartbroken\" by the attacks on the officers.\n\nUS Representative Darren Soto said today that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the US Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the US House to honour the officers.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:56:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

(AP) - A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThey found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nIn a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was \"heartbroken\" by the attacks on the officers.\n\nU.S. Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.\n\nThe officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek the death penalty, explaining it's not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims' relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ayala didn't respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Police arrested a Marine veteran in the Kissimmee shooting and charged him Saturday.\n\nThe second officer shot in Kissimmee is unlikely to survive his wounds, the city's police chief said Saturday morning.\n\nThe deadly night for Florida police officers was also marked by the shooting of two Pennsylvania state troopers, who were struck by bullets outside a store in Fairchance, Pa. south of Pittsburgh, news reports said.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter and Sgt. Richard Howard of the Kissimmee Police had been \"checking out\" a trio of people during a regular patrol in one of the city's neighborhoods when Baxter began to scuffle with one around 9:30 p.m., Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters Saturday morning. Howard, who arrived as a backup, became involved in the fight when gunshots were fired and struck both officers.\n\nNeither had time to return fire, O'Dell said. Baxter was killed. Howard was gravely wounded.\n\nAbout an hour and a half later and 160 miles north, two Jacksonville police officers were shot while responding to a call reporting a suicidal person on the city's westside. When the suspect, later identified as Derrick Rashard Brabham, exited the house with a semi-automatic rifle, he traded gunfire with the police, the Jacksonville Times-Union reported. One officer was shot in the stomach, and another was shot in both hands.\n\nBrabham was declared dead after being taken to a nearby hospital. The officers, later identified as Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell, were both in stable condition Saturday morning, according to the Times-Union.\n\nAbout two hours after the shooting in Kissimmee, police arrested 45-year-old Everett Glenn Miller when he fled to a bar around 11:30 p.m. Miller, a Marine veteran who had been recently taken into custody by the Osecola County Sheriff's Office over mental health concerns, was found with two guns, a 9mm and .22 revolver, the Orlando Sentinel reported.\n\nMiller was charged Saturday morning with resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon, according to Osecola County Jail records. An early investigation found that Miller had also threatened police officers online, O'Dell said. He added that his officers intended to use Baxter's handcuffs on Miller when he is taken to the county jail, and that he expects Miller will also face a murder charge, according to the Sentinel.\n\nHoward remained in critical condition in the hospital Saturday, O'Dell said, with \"not much hope that he will survive this.\"\n\nBaxter, 27, had served in the Kissimmee Police Department for three years and was married to a fellow officer; Howard had been an officer in the city for 10.

(AP) -- A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThey found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nIn a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was \"heartbroken\" by the attacks on the officers.\n\nU.S. Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.\n\nThe officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek the death penalty, explaining it's not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims' relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.\n\nGov. Rick Scott on Saturday evening issued an executive order removing the case from Ayala and reassigning it.\n\n\"Today, I am using my executive authority to reassign this case to State Attorney Brad King to ensure the victims of last night's attack and their families receive the justice they deserve,\" Scott said in the order.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ayala didn't respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Sam Howard were responding to a suspicious activity call.\n\nAccording to O'Dell, the casualties may have occurred during an ambush when the officers were responding to the call.\n\nThe police chief said that within minutes after the officers reached the spot, gunfire erupted, surprising the officers, who were not able to return fire.\n\nO'Dell added, \"Officers immediately responded to the area and found two of their fallen brothers gravely injured on the road way.\"\n\nThe police chief said that Baxter, a three-year-veteran of the Kissimmee Police Department, was pronounced dead at the scene, while Howard remains hospitalized.\n\nHe added, \"Nobody was being placed in handcuffs. If all things checked out, the officers would have been on their way.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the police also noted that three people had been arrested after the shooting and a manhunt had been launched for the fourth person.\n\nO'Dell said, \"At this time, we have a strong suspect in custody that we are interviewing.\"\n\nAuthorities also added that in a separate incident, two other officers were hurt in gunfire the same night.\n\nOn Friday night, two officers in Jacksonville, Florida, were also injured.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno said that when officers arrived to attend an attempted suicide call, they encountered a man armed with a high-powered rifle and exchanged gunfire.\n\none officer was struck in both of his hands while the other was hit in his stomach during the shooting, Bruno said.\n\nHe added that the suspect, who was also injured, died after he was taken to a local hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Melinda Bondarenka, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania State Police said that two state troopers were shot in Pennsylvania late on Friday night and that their condition remains unknown.\n\nFlorida Gov.

Police said one officer was killed and another gravely injured in the central Florida city. (Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel/AP)\n\nOne officer was killed and three others were injured in two separate Florida shootings Friday night, outbreaks of violence against police that reverberated across the nation.\n\nThe first shooting incident left one officer dead and another \"gravely\" injured in Kissimmee, Fla., just south of Orlando. Officers were responding to a report of suspicious activity in a high-crime area when they were taken by surprise, officials said.\n\nThe second shooting, about 90 minutes later in Jacksonville, left two officers injured. Police were dispatched to deal with an armed suicidal man when he came out firing.\n\nAll the shootings were \"deflating to law enforcement and heartbreaking,\" Kissimmee Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters, shortly after he announced that Officer Matthew Baxter had died of his injuries.\n\nAbout 9:30 p.m. Friday, Baxter and Sgt. Sam Howard were on patrol in a neighborhood in the north part of the city where police were trying to crack down on heightened drug activity. The officers were searching several suspects when they got into a scuffle with one, who opened fire, O'Dell said at the news conference.\n\nThe officers didn't have time to return fire, O'Dell said. \"It looked like they were surprised by the gunfire.\"\n\nHoward remained in grave condition at a hospital near the shooting, O'Dell said, and there was \"not much hope that he will survive this.\"\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter succumbed to his injuries. Officer Sam Howard is in very grave condition. pic.twitter.com/oXypORJaIn\n\n-- Kissimmee Police (@kissimmeepolice) August 19, 2017\n\nPolice began searching for the shooter and announced Saturday morning that they'd arrested Everett Miller, who is charged with murder.\n\nAs investigators learned more about Miller, O'Dell said he was disheartened to learn that the suspect had posted violent anti-police comments on social media and that no one had reported it to authorities. O'Dell didn't detail the comments.\n\nNearly two hours later and 165 miles north, police officers in Jacksonville were summoned to a home on the city's west side to defuse a situation involving a suicidal man armed with a gun, according to the Florida Times-Union. There was an extra element of danger: Dispatchers told the officers three other people were inside the home with the armed man.\n\n[U.S. police chiefs blast Trump for endorsing 'police brutality']\n\nAs a team of officers approached the house, they heard gunshots and feared they were dealing with an active shooter.\n\nThe suspect came out firing a high-powered rifle, police said. He was killed during the ensuing firefight with officers and had not been identified early Saturday.\n\nTwo officers were wounded, though their injuries are not life-threatening. The three other people in the house were okay.\n\nAnd around 8 p.m. Friday, two Pennsylvania State troopers were shot southeast of Pittsburgh after stopping a man who had an outstanding warrant, according to Pittsburgh ABC-affiliate WPVI. One trooper managed to return fire, killing the suspect.\n\nAs the police agencies sorted through the aftermath of the attacks, President Trump tweeted a show of solidarity.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones. We are with you!#LESM\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2017\n\nAnd Florida Gov.

The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThey found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nIn a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was \"heartbroken\" by the attacks on the officers.\n\nU.S. Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.\n\nThe officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek the death penalty, explaining it's not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims' relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.\n\nGov. Rick Scott on Saturday evening issued an executive order removing the case from Ayala and reassigning it.\n\n\"Today, I am using my executive authority to reassign this case to State Attorney Brad King to ensure the victims of last night's attack and their families receive the justice they deserve,\" Scott said in the order.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ayala didn't respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.\n\nSgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night's attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller.\n\nMiller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn't yet said what charges he could face for Howard's death.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThey found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man's child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman's mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night's confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nIn a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was \"heartbroken\" by the attacks on the officers.\n\nU.S. Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.\n\nThe officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn't seek the death penalty, explaining it's not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims' relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.\n\nGov. Rick Scott on Saturday evening issued an executive order removing the case from Ayala and reassigning it.\n\n\"Today, I am using my executive authority to reassign this case to State Attorney Brad King to ensure the victims of last night's attack and their families receive the justice they deserve,\" Scott said in the order.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ayala didn't respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:41:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "00:41:00", "lang":

He's a former Marine with a recent mental health commitment.\n\nAugust 18 was a very bloody night for American law enforcement. In the span of less than two hours, six American police officers were shot in separate incidents in three different cities in Florida and Pennsylvania. In addition to Kissimmee, officers were shot in Jacksonville, Florida and Fairchance, Pennsylvania.\n\nTwo officers were shot in each of the three locations in incidents that started between 9 p.m. and 10:50 p.m. on the east coast.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nThe Kissimmee police chief said in a news conference that he believed the officers walked into an \"ambush,\" saying they were caught so by surprise that they never got a round off in self defense.

There is an incendiary Facebook page some on social media are attributing to him, which Heavy is working to verify.\n\nThe suspect is accused of trying to draw on officers again later when they arrested him.\n\n\"A couple hours after the shooting, police located Miller and when they confronted him, they say he reached for his waistband. That's when the officer tackled him and took him into custody. Miller reportedly had two weapons on him,\" reported WTSP-TV, which added that Miller is a former Marine.\n\nThe shooting in Kissimmee, Florida left officer Baxter dead and Sgt.

Responding officers found \"two of their fallen brothers gravely injured on the roadway,\" the chief said.\n\nOfficer Baxter, the officer who died, is a 3-year police veteran who is a father of three and who is married to another officer on the force.\n\nKissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said in a news conference, \"These are beloved fathers and husbands and sons. So we are doing everything we can to support the families.\" Police shared the photo of Officer Baxter at the top of this story in June with the caption, \"Officer Baxter connects with a local family. Conversations and Slurpee Coupons. All about positive interactions. #OperationChill.\"\n\nThe second officer, Sgt. Sam Howard, was initially reported to have died but was later described by the police chief as being in very grave condition.\n\nHoward, a 10-year veteran of the force, was still clinging to life on August 19.\n\nMike DeForest, of News 5, reported that Miller was recently committed on a mental health evaluation.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to have to come to speak to you tonight about another senseless tragedy, one that has resulted in the death of one of our police officers and the grave, critical situation of another,\" the police chief said in the news conference. \"This evening, Sgt. Sam Howard, a 10-year veteran of the Kissimmee police department and officer Matthew Baxter, a three-year veteran of the Kissimmee police department checked out suspicious persons...in the city.\"\n\nLocal officials, President Donald Trump, and those who knew the officers expressed grief on social media.\n\n\"Heartbreaking loss of two of Kissimee's finest officers,\" Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs tweeted. \"Please join in prayers for families, friends and law enforcement.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on the Kissimmee police shooting.\n\nWrote one woman of Officer Baxter on Facebook, \"RIP Kissimmee Officer Matthew Baxter. My family knew him and we are heart broken. We are praying for the family and for all those grieving the death of our officers tonight, who serve to protect our community. May peace be with you all.\"\n\nIt was a terrible night for law enforcement. Two police officers were also shot in Jacksonville, Florida. They are in critical and stable condition. They were shot when a suicidal suspect fired a high-powered rifle through a doorway at them. The suspect was killed by police.\n\nTwo troopers were shot in Fairchance, Pennsylvania. Both were in stable condition. That suspect was also killed by police.\n\nThis post is being updated with more information on Miller as it is learned.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:14:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 417, "date": "2017-08-18", "freq": 2, "textStart": 408, "amb": false, "imp": true}, {"textEnd": 3008, "textStart": 2999, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "12:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181844", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182437", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "195816", "label": {"eng": "Fairchance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchance,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairchance"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "242095", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 5}, {"id": "302545", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "302866", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "score": 3}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 2}, {"id": "302958", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Murder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "score": 3}, {"id": "303465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "score": 2}, {"id": "325660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WTSP"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTSP", "score": 5}, {"id": "334381", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Teresa Jacobs"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Jacobs", "score": 2}, {"id": "334382", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Orange County, Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Orange_County,_Florida", "score": 2}, {"id": "340356", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Area"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "482285", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Slurpee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurpee", "score": 2}, {"id": "627568", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WFTS-TV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFTS-TV", "score": 3}], "image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/miller-e1503151910418.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "timeCrawl": "15:51:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Everett Glenn Miller: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know", "originalArticle": null}

Sam Howard, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell at a news conference Saturday. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, the police chief said.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller would be taken to jail wearing the fallen officer's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, Howard was in \"grave, critical condition\" at the hospital, O'Dell said.\n\n\"It's grave. Not much hope that he will survive this,\" the police chief said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years.

Richard \"Sam\" Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter were shot in the McLaren Circle area of Kissimmee, according to a department spokeswoman.\n\nHoward died off his wounds Saturday. Baxter died Friday night, shortly after the shooting.\n\nTwo Jacksonville, Fla., police officers were also shot on Friday night, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Both survived.\n\nTwo Pennsylvania state troopers were also reported shot late Friday.\n\nBaxter was investigating three suspicious people about 9:30 p.m., when Howard came to help and a \"scuffle\" broke out, Kissimmee police Chief Jeff O'Dell said. That's when Marine veteran Everett Glenn Miller, 45, allegedly shot the officers.\n\nInvestigators are still working to understand the details of what happened in the moments before the shooting, officials said.\n\nThe officers -- who were wearing body armor under their uniforms -- apparently did not have a chance to return fire. O'Dell said \"it looked like they were surprised\" by the gunfire.\n\nMiller fled to a local bar, where Osceola County sheriff's deputies found him about 11:30 p.m. When they approached him, Miller reached for his waistband -- but a fast-acting deputy tackled him and he was arrested, O'Dell said. Miller was carrying a 9-millimeter pistol and a .22-caliber revolver, the police chief said.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office recently took Miller into custody under Florida's Baker Act, which allows involuntary commitment of people in mental health crises. Miller, who has no criminal record in Florida, was enlisted in the Marines from 1989 to 2010, according to military records.\n\nO'Dell said the community needs to help law enforcement. Social media posts showed Miller threatening law enforcement, O'Dell said, \"but we never got a call on that.''\n\nA Facebook page believed to be Miller's is filled with posts expressing anger over racism, slavery and the Ku Klux Klan. In one post, he shared a meme encouraging people to \"shoot back\" with a photo of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"You can poke a tie up dog for so long,\" Miller wrote.\n\nO'Dell said his officers would press forward with their duties while mourning their co-workers and friends.\n\n\"We do not get to stop and cry for someone we've lost or mourn our hero,\" O'Dell said. \"At the time we go through it, the men and women of law enforcement are required to continue working and bring this individual to justice.\"\n\nBaxter, 27, was married to a fellow Kissimmee police officer and had four young children, O'Dell said. Howard, 36, had one child.\n\n\"They are both wonderful men, family men. They are both very committed to the community,\" O'Dell said. \"They were the epitome of what you ask for in law enforcement officers.\"\n\nThe last Kissimmee officer killed on the job was shot in 1983.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said on social media that their \"thoughts and prayers\" were with the Kissimmee police.\n\nIt has also been a dangerous year for law enforcement in Central Florida. Lt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed in a gunfight in a Wal-Mart parking lot while attempting to arrest a man suspected of killing his ex-girlfriend.\n\nOrange

Sam Howard, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell at a news conference Saturday. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, the police chief said.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller would be taken to jail wearing the fallen officer's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, Howard was in \"grave, critical condition\" at the hospital, O'Dell said.\n\n\"It's grave. Not much hope that he will survive this,\" the police chief said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years.

Richard \"Sam\" Howard died Saturday from gunshot wounds he suffered when he and fellow officer Matthew Baxter were shot during a routine stop in the McLaren Circle area, according to department spokeswoman.\n\nBaxter died Friday night shortly after the shooting.\n\nBaxter was investigating three suspicious people about 9:30 p.m. near Palmway and Cypress streets when Howard came to help and a \"scuffle\" broke out, O'Dell said. That's when police say Marine veteran Everett Glenn Miller, 45, shot the officers.\n\nInvestigators are still working to understand the details of what happened in the moments before the shooting, officials said.\n\nThe officers -- who were wearing body armor underneath their uniforms -- did not have a chance to return fire. O'Dell said \"it looked like they were surprised\" by the gunfire.\n\nMiller fled to Roscoe's Bar at 2344 N. Orange Blossom Trail, where Osceola County Sheriff's Office detectives found him about 11:30 p.m. When the officers approached him, Miller reached for his waistband -- but a fast-acting deputy tackled him to the ground and arrested him, O'Dell said.\n\n\"Extremely brave and heroic actions by the deputy, there were other people in the vicinity,\" O'Dell said. \"They went hands-on, tackled him to the ground and secured him [and] located a 9mm and .22 revolver on his person.\"\n\nWhen officers took Miller to the Osceola County Jail Saturday, they placed Baxter's handcuffs on his wrists, O'Dell said.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office recently took Miller into custody under Florida's Baker Act, which allows involuntary commitment of people in mental health crises. Miller, who has no criminal record in Florida, was enlisted in the Marines from 1989 to 2010, according to military records.\n\nO'Dell said the community needs to work with law enforcement. Social media posts showed Miller threatening law enforcement, O'Dell said, \"but we never got a call on that.''\n\nA Facebook page believed to be Miller's is filled with posts expressing anger over racism, slavery and the KKK. In one post, he shared a meme encouraging people to \"shoot back\" with a photo of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"You can poke a tie [sic] up dog for so long,\" Miller wrote.\n\nO'Dell said the news is especially difficult for members of his agency, as they must press forward while suffering the loss of a coworker and friend.\n\n\"We do not get to stop and cry for someone we've lost or mourn our hero,\" O'Dell said. \"At the time we go through it, the men and women of law enforcement are required to continue working and bring this individual to justice.\"\n\nBaxter, 27, was married to a fellow Kissimmee Police officer and had four young children, O'Dell said. Howard, 36, had one child.\n\n\"They are both wonderful men, family men. They are both very committed to the community,\" O'Dell said. \"They were the epitome of what you ask for in law enforcement officers.\"\n\nO'Dell praised other police agencies, including the Osceola and Orange sheriff's offices and Orlando Police Department, for their help.\n\n\"Everyone came to the scene without being asked,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe last Kissimmee officer killed on the job was shot in 1983.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said on social media that their \"thoughts and prayers\" were with the Kissimmee Police.\n\nThe area where the shooting happened has historically been plagued by crime. O'Dell said Howard and Baxter were doing proactive police work there because it is known for drug sales. In 2008, law enforcement led a crackdown on drugs and violence that \"ravaged the McLaren Circle area,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nOfficers arrested 19 people during that operation, and witnesses in subsequent court cases testified crime was so rampant that mobile businesses such as FedEx, UPS, pizza delivery and taxi services \"refused to enter the area to provide services to residents.\" Even the U.S. Postal Service stopped its route through the neighborhood for a time.\n\nKissimmee Police Officer Matthew Baxter was 'a good spirit' \"\n\nA prayer vigil will be held at the Hope Mission Church, 1431 Palmway St., at 3 p.m. Sunday. The church sits at the intersection where Howard and Baxter were shot.\n\nThe City of Kissimmee has set up an account with SunTrust Bank for individuals interested in donating to Howard and Baxter's families. Donors can go to any SunTrust Bank location beginning Monday to contribute, a city spokeswoman said.\n\nKissimmee Police has more than 100 officers. O'Dell took over the department in August 2016.\n\nKissimmee Police mourns death of Sgt. Sam Howard \"\n\nTwo Jacksonville police officers were also shot on the Westside of Jacksonville, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Two Pennsylvania Troopers were also reported shot late Friday.\n\nIt has also been a dangerous year for law enforcement in Central Florida. Lt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed in a gunfight in the Wal-Mart parking lot while attempting to arrest Markeith Loyd, a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. Loyd was later captured after a nine-day manhunt.\n\nOrange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, a motorcycle officer, was also killed that day during the pursuit for Loyd.\n\ncdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com, 407-650-6931 or @CaitlinDoornbos\n\nTwo police officers shot in Kissimmee \"\n\nInteractive map: Every homicide in Central Florida \"", "dateTime":

Sam Howard, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell at a news conference Saturday. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, the police chief said.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller would be taken to jail wearing the fallen officer's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, Howard was in \"grave, critical condition\" at the hospital, O'Dell said.\n\n\"It's grave. Not much hope that he will survive this,\" the police chief said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, other two officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where three other people were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov.

(AP) - A suspect in the fatal shooting of a police officer in Florida and the grave wounding of a sergeant was arrested several hours after the attack in a bar, authorities said Saturday.\n\nEverett Miller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Officer Matthew Baxter and could face other charges for the wounding of Sgt. Sam Howard, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell at a news conference Saturday. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, the police chief said.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller would be taken to jail wearing the fallen officer's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, Howard was in \"grave, critical condition\" at the hospital, O'Dell said.\n\n\"It's grave. Not much hope that he will survive this,\" the police chief said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, other two officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where three other people were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was heartbroken by the news of Baxter's death and was praying for a quick recovery for Howard.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- A suspect in the fatal shooting of a police officer in Florida and the grave wounding of a sergeant was arrested several hours after the attack in a bar, authorities said Saturday.\n\nEverett Miller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Officer Matthew Baxter and could face other charges for the wounding of Sgt. Sam Howard, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell at a news conference Saturday. Kissimmee is located south of the theme park hub of Orlando, Florida.\n\nDuring a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was \"checking out\" three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, the police chief said.\n\nThe officers didn't have an opportunity to return fire. They weren't wearing body cameras.\n\nSheriff's deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O'Dell said.\n\nThe found a handgun and revolver on him.\n\n\"They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe police chief said Miller would be taken to jail wearing the fallen officer's handcuffs.\n\nAuthorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.\n\nMiller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. The early stages of the investigation shows that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, Howard was in \"grave, critical condition\" at the hospital, O'Dell said.\n\n\"It's grave. Not much hope that he will survive this,\" the police chief said.\n\nBaxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children.\n\nHoward, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O'Dell said.\n\n\"They are two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two committed to doing it the right way.\"\n\nSeparately, other two officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where three other people were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. \"We are with you!\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov.

'They stared danger in the face,'\" journalist Meagan Harris reported of the police comments at the briefing.\n\nAccording to the JSO briefing by Mike Bruno, officers were dispatched to an attempted suicide call where there were \"three additional victims inside the house that had retreated to a back bedroom for their safety. While the officers were en route, the suspect armed himself with a high-powered rifle.\" The officers, who were in a group of four-five, could hear gunfire coming from the house. They formed a contact team. They thought it was an active shooter situation inside the house, so they approached the house, the media spokesperson for police said.\n\nAs they approached the house and attempted to enter one of the doorways, \"the suspect began shooting through the door at the officers.\" There was an exchange of gunfire. During that exchange of gunfire, two officers were struck by bullets, as was the suspect. One officer was struck in both hands, and the other officer was shot in his stomach with the rifle fire, said authorities.\n\n\"He engaged the officers before they made entry into the house,\" Bruno said of the suspect. The house is set back from the roadway quite a bit.\n\nThe three people inside the house who weren't the suspect were not injured.\n\nOne officer was later listed as being in critical condition, one was in stable condition, and the suspect was dead. \"We thought we had an active shooter type situation,\" the media spokesperson explained.\n\nYou can watch the police briefing here:\n\n\"We often talk about the inherent dangers of police work, but tonight those dangers were all too real for these police officers.

Richard \"Sam\" Howard died Saturday from gunshot wounds he suffered when he and fellow officer Matthew Baxter were shot during a routine stop in the McLaren Circle area, according to department spokeswoman.\n\nBaxter died Friday night shortly after the shooting.\n\nBaxter was investigating three suspicious people about 9:30 p.m. near Palmway and Cypress streets when Howard came to help and a \"scuffle\" broke out. That's when police say Marine veteran Everett Glenn Miller, 45, shot the officers.\n\nInvestigators are still working to understand the details of what happened in the moments before the shooting, officials said.\n\nThe officers -- who were wearing body armor underneath their uniforms -- did not have a chance to return fire. O'Dell said \"it looked like they were surprised\" by the gunfire.\n\nMiller fled to Roscoe's Bar at 2344 N. Orange Blossom Trail, where Osceola County Sheriff's Office detectives found him about 11:30 p.m. When the officers approached him, Miller reached for his waistband -- but a fast-acting deputy tackled him to the ground and arrested him, O'Dell said.\n\n\"Extremely brave and heroic actions by the deputy, there were other people in the vicinity,\" O'Dell said. \"They went hands-on, tackled him to the ground and secured him [and] located a a 9mm and .22 revolver on his person.\"\n\nWhen officers took Miller to the Osceola County Jail Saturday, they placed Baxter's handcuffs on his wrists, O'Dell said.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office recently took Miller into custody under Florida's Baker Act, which allows involuntary commitment of people in mental health crises.\n\nO'Dell said the community needs to work with law enforcement. Social media posts showed Miller threatening law enforcement, O'Dell said, \"but we never got a call on that.''\n\nO'Dell said the news is especially difficult for members of his agency, as they must press forward while suffering the loss of a coworker and friend.\n\n\"We do not get to stop and cry for someone we've lost or mourn our hero,\" O'Dell said. \"At the time we go through it, the men and women of law enforcement are required to continue working and bring this individual to justice.\"\n\nBaxter, 27, was married to a fellow Kissimmee Police officer and had four young children, O'Dell said. Howard, 36, has one child.\n\n\"They are both wonderful men, family men. They are both very committed to the community,\" O'Dell said. \"They were the epitome of what you ask for in law enforcement officers.\"\n\nO'Dell praised other police agencies, including the Osceola and Orange sheriff's offices and Orlando Police Department, for their help.\n\n\"Everyone came to the scene without being asked,\" O'Dell said.\n\nThe last Kissimmee officer killed on the job was shot in 1983.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said on social media that their \"thoughts and prayers\" were with the Kissimmee Police.\n\nThe area where the shooting happened has historically been plagued by crime. O'Dell said Howard and Baxter were doing proactive police work there because it is known for drug sales. In 2008, law enforcement led a crackdown on drugs and violence that \"ravaged the McLaren Circle area,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nOfficers arrested 19 people during that operation, and witnesses in subsequent court cases testified crime was so rampant that mobile businesses such as FedEx, UPS, pizza delivery and taxi services \"refused to enter the area to provide services to residents.\" Even the U.S. Postal Service stopped its route through the neighborhood for a time.\n\nKissimmee Police has more than 100 officers. O'Dell took over the department in August 2016.\n\nTwo Jacksonville police officers were also shot on the Westside of Jacksonville, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Two Pennsylvania Troopers were also reported shot late Friday.\n\nIt has also been a dangerous year for law enforcement in Central Florida. Lt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed in a gunfight in the Wal-Mart parking lot while attempting to arrest Markeith Loyd, a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. Loyd was later captured after a nine-day manhunt.\n\nOrange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, a motorcycle officer, was also killed that day during the pursuit for Loyd.\n\ncdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com, 407-650-6931 or @CaitlinDoornbos\n\nTwo police officers shot in Kissimmee \"\n\nInteractive map: Every homicide in Central Florida \"", "dateTime":

Officers were responding to a report of suspicious activity in a high-crime area when they were taken by surprise, officials said.\n\nPolice Chief Jeff O'Dell discusses the shooting deaths of two police officers and the arrest of a suspect at a Saturday news conference in Kissimmee, Fla. Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nThe second shooting, about 90 minutes later in Jacksonville, left two officers injured. Police were dispatched to deal with an armed suicidal man when he came out firing.\n\nAll the shootings were \"deflating to law enforcement and heartbreaking,\" Kissimmee Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters, shortly after he announced that Officer Matthew Baxter had died of his injuries. Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday, police announced on Facebook Saturday afternoon.\n\nAbout 9:30 p.m. Friday, Baxter and Howard were on patrol in a neighborhood in the north part of the city where police were trying to crack down on heightened drug activity.\n\nThe officers were searching several suspects when they got into a scuffle with one, who opened fire, O'Dell said at the news conference.\n\nThe officers didn't have time to return fire, O'Dell said. \"It looked like they were surprised by the gunfire.\"\n\nPolice began searching for the gunman and announced Saturday morning that they'd arrested Everett Miller, who is charged with murder.\n\nAs investigators learned more about Miller, O'Dell said he was disheartened to learn that the suspect had posted violent anti-police comments on social media and that no one had reported it to authorities. O'Dell didn't detail the comments.\n\nNearly two hours later and 165 miles north, police in Jacksonville were summoned to a home on the city's west side to defuse a situation involving a suicidal man armed with a gun, according to the Florida Times-Union.\n\nThere was an extra element of danger: Dispatchers told the officers that three other people were inside the home with the armed man.\n\nAs a team of officers approached the house, they heard gunshots and feared they were dealing with an active gunman.\n\nThe suspect came out firing a high-powered rifle, police said. He was killed during the ensuing firefight with officers and had not been identified Saturday.\n\nTwo officers were wounded, although their injuries were not life-threatening. The three other people in the house were uninjured.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Richard \"Sam\" Howard was killed helping a fellow officer in the community he served for 10 years.\n\nThe Police Department reported \"with a heavy heart\" that Howard died Saturday afternoon, succumbing to his injuries from a double shooting the night before that rocked the law enforcement community nationwide.\n\nHoward, 36, was listed in \"grave condition\" overnight after he and fellow officer Matthew Baxter were shot in the line of duty about 9:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe shooting happened after Baxter initiated a routine check into three suspicious people near the intersection of Cypress and Palmway streets. Howard was in the area and went to back up Baxter when he heard his call, a Kissimmee Police spokeswoman said.\n\nAt some point during the exchange, 45-year-old Everette Glenn Miller pulled out a handgun and shot the two officers. They did not have time to fire back, Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said.\n\nBaxter died shortly after the shooting.\n\nHoward was married and a father of one child, Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said.\n\nHe was with the department for 10 years, and just received a promotion last month, according to the Kissimmee Police Department.\n\nKissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said Baxter and Howard were the \"epitome\" of what officers should be.\n\n\"They're two wonderful men, family men,\" O'Dell said. \"They are two officers who are committed to doing it the right way. They are both very committed to the community.\"\n\nEverett Miller was arrested on a first degree murder charge related to the killings. He is being held at the Osceola County Jail.\n\nA prayer vigil will be held at the Hope Mission Church, 1431 Palmway St., at 3 p.m. Sunday. The church sits at the intersection where Howard and Baxter were shot.\n\nThe City of Kissimmee has set up an account with SunTrust Bank for individuals interested in donating to Howard and Baxter's families.

NPR reports that Officer Matthew Baxter was killed and Sgt. Sam Howard remains in \"grave critical condition\" after responding to an incident in central Kissimmee, Fla., Friday evening. Per CNN, the officers were caught off guard by gunfire when responding to a suspicious activity call. They were unable to return fire in the possible ambush. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called Baxter, a father of three and three-year veteran on the force, a hero, tweeting: \"Tonight we lost a brave officer - Matthew Baxter. Husband/father/hero. Praying for @kissimmeepolice\"; President Trump also sent condolences over social media after the news broke. Kissimmee police have three suspects in custody and are searching for another.\n\n\"This is a tough time for each one of us,\" Kissimmee Chief Jeff O'Dell said, asking the public to keep the police department and the families of the fallen officers in our \"thoughts and prayers.\" In a separate incident 165 miles north of Kissimmee in Jacksonville, Fla., two officers responding to an attempted suicide call Friday night were shot. The suspect began shooting the responding officers through a door with a \"high powered rifle\" before exchanging gunfire outside. The suspect was shot and died later at the hospital; one injured officer is in critical condition, the other in stable condition. Meanwhile, NPR reports that two state troopers serving a warrant in Pennsylvania Friday were shot. No updates on their condition, but they were said to be \"alert and conscious\" after the shooting occurred, when one was flown to a nearby hospital while the other was transported by ambulance.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:16:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "12:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181844", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "242095", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 2}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 5}, {"id": "302545", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "303464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "score": 3}, {"id": "303472", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "score": 4}, {"id": "304070", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "News"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News", "score": 3}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 3}, {"id": "304269", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "score": 3}, {"id": "306136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "score": 2}, {"id": "308986", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "NPR"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "score": 3}, {"id": "311731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Dell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "score": 2}, {"id": "313410", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Newser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newser", "score": 4}, {"id": "330725", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "score": 3}], "image": "http://img2-azcdn.newser.com/image/1138145-12-20170819070812.jpeg", "timeCrawl": "12:16:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "6 Cops Shot Friday in Separate Incidents", "originalArticle": null}

One of those officers has died and the other is left gravely injured, according to Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell.\n\nFOX 35 had earlier reported that both officers had died, based on information our reporters were receiving from those close to the investigation into the shootings.\n\nThe shootings happened as the two officers were responding to a call at the intersection of Palmway and Cypress streets, around 9 p.m. on Friday.\n\nAn active search continued into Saturday morning for a suspect who remained at large. The Florida Highway Patrol advised drivers to avoid the area of U.S. 192 and Orange Blossom Trail, due to a heavy police presence.\n\nThere was a second scene where several police officers gathered, near Roscoe's Bar & Packaging, at 2344 N Orange Blossom Trail. No details were given as to their presence at that location.\n\nThe two officers were responding to a call of suspicious activity around 9 p.m., Chief O'Dell said during a news conference.\n\n\"At approximately 9:32, we received our first call... that our officers were shot,\" he said.\n\nO'Dell said other responding Officers found the two officers on the roadway, when they arrived at the scene.\n\nFOX 35 reporters were first told that one officer was taken to Osceola Regional Medical Center and the other to Orlando Regional Medical Center. Chief O'Dell later clarified that both were taken to Osceola Regional.\n\nOfficer Matthew Baxter, who had served three years with the force, died from his injuries, O'Dell said. Sgt. Sam Howard, 10-year veteran, remained in critical condition.\n\nChief O'Dell said there are four suspects in total. Three had been taken into custody and one was still being sought early Saturday.\n\n\"I can't divulge any information about that, as this is an ongoing investigation,\" he added.\n\nHe told reporters that it has been a dark day for his colleagues as they try to cope with this tragedy.\n\n\"These were beloved fathers and husbands and sons,\" said O'Dell. \"We haven't experienced this in over 25 years.\"\n\nBefore details of the shootings were immediately known, community leaders and other law enforcement officers began sending condolences over Twitter. This was before it was learned that one officer had died and the other was in critical condition.\n\n\"Heartbreaking loss of two of Kissimmee's finest officers. Please join in prayers for families, friends, and law enforcement,\" Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs tweeted.\n\n\"Sending out prayers,\" tweeted Orlando Police Chief John Mina.\n\nThe Winter Park Police Department echoed the sentiment, \"We stand with our brothers and sisters at the Kissimmee Police Department. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved.\"\n\n\"Hard night to look at Twitter. Just want to reach through the screen and comfort the families -- our Family,\" posted Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood.\n\nEarly Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted, \"My thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones. We are with you!\"\n\nLess than an hour after two police officers were killed in Kissimmee, Florida, reports of two officers being shot in Jacksonville.

Police were dispatched to deal with an armed suicidal man when he came out firing.\n\nAll the shootings were \"deflating to law enforcement and heartbreaking,\" Kissimmee Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters, shortly after he announced that Officer Matthew Baxter had died of his injuries. Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday, police announced on Facebook Saturday afternoon.\n\nAbout 9:30 p.m. Friday, Baxter and Howard were on patrol in a neighborhood in the north part of the city where police were trying to crack down on heightened drug activity.\n\nThe officers were searching several suspects when they got into a scuffle with one, who opened fire, O'Dell said at the news conference.\n\nThe officers didn't have time to return fire, O'Dell said. \"It looked like they were surprised by the gunfire.\"\n\nPolice began searching for the shooter and announced Saturday morning that they'd arrested Everett Miller, who is charged with murder.\n\nAs investigators learned more about Miller, O'Dell said he was disheartened to learn that the suspect had posted violent anti-police comments on social media and that no one had reported it to authorities. O'Dell didn't detail the comments.\n\nNearly two hours later and 165 miles north, police officers in Jacksonville were summoned to a home on the city's west side to defuse a situation involving a suicidal man armed with a gun, according to the Florida Times-Union. There was an extra element of danger: Dispatchers told the officers three other people were inside the home with the armed man.\n\nAs a team of officers approached the house, they heard gunshots and feared they were dealing with an active shooter.\n\nThe suspect came out firing a high-powered rifle, police said. He was killed during the ensuing firefight with officers and had not been identified early Saturday.\n\nTwo officers were wounded, though their injuries are not life-threatening. The three other people in the house were okay.\n\nAnd around 8 p.m. Friday, two Pennsylvania State troopers were shot southeast of Pittsburgh after stopping a man who had an outstanding warrant, according to Pittsburgh ABC-affiliate WPVI.

Minutes later, Kissimmee Police dispatch received word that the officers had been shot at, police Chief Jeffrey O'Dell said in a press conference.\n\nKissimmee residents often \"get tired of putting up with some of the drug dealing and nonsense that goes on in the neighborhood\" and call the police to come check it out, O'Dell said.\n\nThe two responding officers, Matthew Baxter and Sam Howard, arrived at the scene and spoke with three individuals when a fourth person arrived and began shooting. The officers were not able to shoot back.\n\n\"They were surprised,\" O'Dell said. \"It's too early to tell\" O'Dell said when asked if it was an ambush, but added \"it's leading that way.\"\n\nBoth sustained injuries from gunshots. Baxter later died from his injuries and Howard is in grave condition, Kissimmee police department said on Twitter.\n\nAt least two people were taken into custody and police are looking for a third suspect.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted his condolences around 1:30 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe area where the cops were shot, about 20 miles south of Orlando is known for having drug activity. The shooting death of officer Baxter is the first time a Kissimmee police officer has been killed on the job since 1983, the Orlando Sentinel reports.\n\nFollow Thomas Phippen on Twitter\n\nSend tips to [email protected].\n\nClick here for reuse options!\n\nCopyright 2017 Daily Caller News FoundationWATCH TLR'S LATEST VIDEO:\n\nShare +1 Tweet Pin Share StumbleShares 0", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:58:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "11:58:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182155", "label": {"eng": "Orlando"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 2}, {"id": "303465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "score": 2}, {"id": "303472", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "score": 3}, {"id": "305488", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "score": 3}, {"id": "306536", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tweet (singer)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(singer)", "score": 4}, {"id": "311731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Dell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "score": 5}, {"id": "313169", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Sentinel", "score": 1}, {"id": "323872", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shooting of Trayvon Martin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin", "score": 2}], "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kissimmee_Police_Car_1412021_ver1.0_640_360_1460824973049_3768724_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "DEADLY NIGHT FOR COPS: Two Shot, One Dead In Suspected Ambush", "originalArticle": null}

According to Police Chief Jeff O'Dell, officer Matthew lost his life and Sgt. Sam Howard was in a critical condition, reports said. Kissimmee is located at around 23 kilometers (14 miles) south of Orlando, Florida.\n\nAccording to the police, both the officers were responding to a 911 call at 9:30 p.m. EDT. They were checking for suspicious people involving drug activity. The police did not confirm if they were ambushed, Washington Post reported. They said the officers might not have got a change to shoot back.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to have to come speak to you tonight about another senseless tragedy. This is a tough time for each and every one of us,\" Police Chief Jeff O'Dell was quoted in media reports. Police made two arrests in relation to the incident and were looking for a third suspect.\n\nPresident Donald Trump too expressed grief over the incident on Twitter.\n\nIn another shooting in Florida, two officers were shot in Jacksonville during a gunfire exchange. While the condition of one of the officers was stable, the other one was said to be critical, reports said. One of the armed suspects was shot dead. According to JSO Director Mike Bruno, one of the officers was shot in stomach while the other one was shot in the hand, reports said.\n\nAt around 11:00 p.m. EDT, four to five officers responded to a call of attempted sucide at a home in Seaboard Avenue near Timuquana Road. On reaching the place, the officers heard gunfire shots. As they approached the house, the suspect started firing at them, after which they launched a counterattack, Bruno said.\n\nWhile two officers were injured during the counterattack, the suspect was shot dead.\n\nIn a third incident at Fairchance, Pennsylvania, two state police troopers were shot at, however, their injuries were not life threatening.

Police were dispatched to deal with an armed suicidal man when he came out firing.\n\nAll the shootings were \"deflating to law enforcement and heartbreaking,\" Kissimmee Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters, shortly after he announced that Officer Matthew Baxter had died of his injuries. Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday, police announced on Facebook Saturday afternoon.\n\nAbout 9:30 p.m. Friday, Baxter and Howard were on patrol in a neighborhood in the north part of the city where police were trying to crack down on heightened drug activity.\n\nThe officers were searching several suspects when they got into a scuffle with one, who opened fire, O'Dell said at the news conference.\n\nThe officers didn't have time to return fire, O'Dell said. \"It looked like they were surprised by the gunfire.\"\n\nPolice began searching for the gunman and announced Saturday morning that they'd arrested Everett Miller, who is charged with murder.\n\nAs investigators learned more about Miller, O'Dell said he was disheartened to learn that the suspect had posted violent anti-police comments on social media and that no one had reported it to authorities. O'Dell didn't detail the comments.\n\nNearly two hours later and 165 miles north, police in Jacksonville were summoned to a home on the city's west side to defuse a situation involving a suicidal man armed with a gun, according to the Florida Times-Union.\n\nThere was an extra element of danger: Dispatchers told the officers that three other people were inside the home with the armed man.\n\nAs a team of officers approached the house, they heard gunshots and feared they were dealing with an active gunman.\n\nThe suspect came out firing a high-powered rifle, police said. He was killed during the ensuing firefight with officers and had not been identified Saturday.\n\nTwo officers were wounded, although their injuries were not life-threatening. The three other people in the house were uninjured.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered each morning.

Howard is a 10-year veteran of the department and Baxter had been with the Kissimmee department for three years.\n\nAs of 9 a.m. Saturday, Howard remained in critical condition; O'Dell said there was \"not much hope that he will survive this.\"\n\nMiller, who had two guns -- a 9mm and .22 revolver -- was taken into custody about 11:30 p.m. Friday. O'Dell said officers plan to put Baxter's handcuffs on Miller when they take him to the Osceola County Jail Saturday.\n\nO'Dell said he did not expect to make any additional arrests.\n\n\"This is a tough time for each and every one of us,\" O'Dell said.\n\nO'Dell said the community needs to work with law enforcement. Social media posts showed Miller threatening law enforcement, O'Dell said, \"but we never got a call on that.''\n\nOsceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. said he couldn't believe the news.\n\n\"It's just awful. We're praying for the families of these officers and for the whole KPD family,\" he said.\n\nThe last officer killed on the job was shot 1983.\n\nCarlos Santiago, 37, was driving with his wife and daughter back from dinner on International Drive on Friday night when they saw dozens of patrol cars speed past them on Orange Blossom Trail.\n\n\"They were just flying,\" he said. \"It was pretty obvious something bad had happened.\"\n\nThe area where the shooting happened is in McLaren Circle, which has historically been plagued by crime. O'Dell said Howard and Baxter were doing proactive police work there because it is known for drug sales. In 2008, law enforcement led a crackdown on drugs and violence that \"ravaged the McLaren Circle area,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nOfficers arrested 19 people during that operation, and witnesses in subsequent court cases testified crime was so rampant that mobile businesses such as FedEx, UPS, pizza delivery and taxi services \"refused to enter the area to provide services to residents.\" Even the U.S. Postal Service stopped its route through the neighborhood for a time.\n\n\"It's fairly well known as not a great area. It's pretty rundown compared to the rest of the city and it's known for having more crime,\" Santiago said.\n\nWhile the media waited for O'Dell to address the public in front of the emergency entrance at Osceola Regional Medical Center on Friday night, two women were being escorted out of the building by two police officers. They were both crying and huddled before they saw the lights and cameras outside and dashed back into the building.\n\nAt least four Osceola deputies were stationed by the south entrance to the hospital, wearing body armor and carrying heavy guns, standing next to their patrol cars.\n\nAlexis Nieves, 27, was driving to see a friend when she got stopped at a red light on Orange Blossom Trail and U.S. Highway 192.\n\nShe saw a few cop cars then dozens started arriving to the intersection. She looked to her left and saw an officer with a long gun, the she saw a person being loaded into an ambulance. There were helicopters circling the in the area.\n\nEmergency crews were doing CPR and trying to resuscitate the person. Nieves didn't know it was an officer who had been shot.\n\n\"I just started crying,\" she said. \"I didn't know what to think. It's so sad.\"\n\nNieves said she saw said more than 80 law enforcement vehicles flooding the area, along with fire trucks and EMS vehicles.\n\n\"I was in the middle of it all and couldn't believe what was happening,\" she said. \"I called my friend in tears. I've never seen anything like that.\"\n\nMessages of support flowed out from across the country.\n\nOn its Twitter account, the Orlando Police Department said, \"Please keep @kissimmeepolice in your prayers tonight.\"\n\nThe Orange County Sheriff's Office also offered its own message of comfort, saying, \"Our solidarity is with @kissimmeepolice as they deal with this tragic loss.\"\n\nO'Dell praised other police agencies, including the Osceola and Orange sheriff's offices and Orlando Police Department, for their help.\n\n\"Everyone came to the scene without being asked. We don't get to stop for a minute and cry for somebody we've lost or mourn a hero at the time we're going through it.\"\n\nKissimmee Police has 104 officers. O'Dell took over the department in August 2016.\n\nOn Friday night, there was also a report from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office that two police officers had been shot on the Westside of Jacksonville. Two Pennsylvania Troopers were also reported shot late Friday.\n\nThe shootings received nationwide attention, with President Donald Trump sending thoughts and prayers to the Kissimmee Police.\n\nIt has been a dangerous year for law enforcement in Central Florida. Lt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed in a gunfight in the Wal-Mart parking lot while attempting to arrest Markeith Loyd, a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. Loyd was later captured after a nine-day manhunt.\n\nOrange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, a motorcycle officer, was also killed that day during the pursuit for Loyd.\n\nEarlier reports Friday night from official sources indicated that two officers had died.\n\nStaff Writers Bianca Padro Ocasio, Christal Hayes, Krista Torralva and Gal Tziperman Lotan contributed to this

The incident took place late on Friday in Kissimmee community, south of Orlando.\n\nBaxter and his colleague Sergeant Sam Howard approached a group of people to question them based on suspicion they might be involved in some illegal activity, Kissimmee police chief Jeff O'Dell said.\n\nHowever, they seemed to have been taken by surprise when they were shot by the group, O'Dell said.\n\nWhile Baxter died, Howard was in \"grave, critical condition and the prognosis does not look good\", Reuters cited the chief as saying.\n\nHe said the two officials were called to the incident site to investigate suspicious activity, which according to reports is about drug dealing.\n\nFour people are reported to have been involved in the incident. The main suspect has been arrested along with two others who were also at the scene. The fourth person is reported to be still at large.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reacted to the incident on Twitter, saying: \"My thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones.\"\n\nAnother shooting took place in Florida on Friday, where a group of officers suffered injuries after they were shot at by an unidentified person.\n\nThe man possessed a high-powered rifle and was reportedly threatening three people in a house in Jacksonville neighbourhood, said the community's Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno.\n\nHe engaged in a gun battle with the officers and shot one of them in his hands and another officer in the stomach.

Praying for a quick recovery for officer in critical condition,\" Scott.\n\nFor the record, this is the MO of previous police ambushes. The suspect or suspect is reported as a \"suspicious person\" and when the police arrive to investigate, they're gunned down.\n\nAlthough 3 suspects are in custody, authorities have yet to identify the race of the killers. Somehow, you have to believe that if they were white supremacists, it would be all over the national news.\n\nElsewhere, 2 police officers were shot in Jacksonville, FL confronting a suicidal man. Two other officers were shot in Fayette County, Pennslvania.\n\nNBC News:\n\nIn Jacksonville, police officers were responding to a call about an attempted suicide at a house. Gunfire was heard from outside the property as officers arrived, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Director of Patrol and Enforcement Mike Bruno told NBC News.\n\nBefore officers even entered the house, the suspect began shooting at them through the doorway and there was an exchange of gunfire in which two officers were struck, one of them in the stomach, Bruno said.\n\nThe suspect is dead and it's not yet known if body cameras were worn or activated.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two troopers were shot and a suspect killed after an incident near a store on West Church Street, Fairchance, Fayette County, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Melinda Bondarenka said in a statement.\n\nOne of the troopers was life-flighted from the scene to a hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia and the other was taken to a hospital via ambulance, NBC station WPXI reported.\n\nBoth were stable and alert, Bondarenka said.\n\nThe probable ambush of cops in Kissimmee reminds us that hate is not confined to one race, or one ideology and that police are the ones on the front lines actually doing battle with the haters. Almost lost in the narrative about the violence in Charlottesville is that two police officers lost their lives when their helicopter crashed. They have become an afterthought to the main stage drama of racists, Nazis, and antifa warring in the streets of an American city.\n\nBetween the violent haters and us stands the \"Thin Blue Line\" of dedicated men and women in law enforcement. Theirs is a thankless, dangerous job made more so by those who wish to kill them to make a political statement. It doesn't matter what color the police officers are - both Kissimmee officers were black. They were targets of violent extremists who wish to make their jobs impossible to carry out.\n\nNo doubt, there are many police officers and sheriff's deputies going to work today wondering if they will be next.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T10:43:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "10:43:00", "lang":

Sam Howard was shot and is in grave condition. The uniformed officers were responding to a call at 9:30 p.m. in the area of Palmway and Cypress streets.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to have to come speak to you tonight about another senseless tragedy,\" O'Dell said.\n\nAt least two people were taken into custody and police were searching for a third suspect.\n\nWhen asked about whether the officers were ambushed, O'Dell said it was too early to say, but it was \"leading toward that.\"\n\nHe said both officers were husbands and fathers.\n\n\"This is a tough time for each and every one of us,\" O'Dell said.\n\nHoward was a 10-year veteran of the department and Baxter had been with the Kissimmee department for three years.\n\nOsceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. said he couldn't believe the news.\n\n\"It's just awful. We're praying for the families of these officers and for the whole KPD family,\" he said.\n\nThe last officer killed on the job was in 1983 after being shot.\n\nInformation about those in custody was not immediately provided.\n\nCarlos Santiago, 37, was driving with his wife and daughter back from dinner on International Drive when they saw dozens of patrol cars speed past them on Orange Blossom Trail.\n\n\"They were just flying,\" he said. \"It was pretty obvious something bad had happened.\"\n\nThe area where the shooting happened is in McLaren Circle.\n\n\"It's fairly well known as not a great area. It's pretty run down compared to the rest of the city and it's known for having more crime,\" Santiago said.\n\nFHP said there was \"heavy police activity\" in the area and told people to avoid the area. There was also a large police presence at Roscoe's late Friday.\n\nWhile the media waited for O'Dell to address the public in front of the emergency entrance at Osceola Regional Medical Center, two women were being escorted out of the building by two police officers. They were both crying and huddled before they saw the lights and cameras outside and dashed back into the building.\n\nAt least four Osceola deputies were stationed by the south entrance to the hospital, wearing body armor and carrying heavy guns, standing next to their patrol cars.\n\nAlexis Nieves, 27, was driving to see a friend when she got stopped at a red light on Orange Blossom Trail and U.S. Highway 192.\n\nShe saw a few cop cars then dozens started arriving to the intersection. She looked to her left and saw an officer with a long gun, the she saw a person being loaded into an ambulance. There were helicopters circling the in the area.\n\nEmergency crews were doing CPR and trying to resuscitate the person. Nieves didn't know it was an officer who had been shot.\n\n\"I just started crying,\" she said. \"I didn't know what to think. It's so sad.\"\n\nNieves said she saw said more than 80 law enforcement vehicles flooding the area, along with fire trucks and EMS vehicles.\n\n\"I was in the middle of it all and couldn't believe what was happening,\" she said. \"I called my friend in tears. I've never seen anything like that.\"\n\nMessages of support flowed out from across the country.\n\nOn its Twitter account, the Orlando Police Department said, \"Please keep @kissimmeepolice in your prayers tonight.\"\n\nThe Orange County Sheriff's Office also offered its own message of comfort, saying, \"Our solidarity is with @kissimmeepolice as they deal with this tragic loss.\"\n\nKissimmee Police has 104 officers. O'Dell took over the department in August 2016.\n\nOn Friday night, there was also a report from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office that two police officers had been shot on the Westside of Jacksonville. Two Pennsylvania Troopers were also reported shot late Friday.\n\nThe shootings received nationwide attention, with President Donald Trump sending thoughts and prayers to the Kissimmee Police.\n\nIt has been a dangerous year for law enforcement in Central Florida. Lt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed in a gunfight in the Wal-Mart parking lot while attempting to arrest Markeith Loyd, a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. Loyd was later captured after a nine-day manhunt.\n\nOrange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, a motorcycle officer, was also killed that day during the pursuit for Loyd.\n\nEarlier reports Friday night from official sources indicated that two officers had died.\n\nStaff Writers Bianca Padro Ocasio, Christal Hayes, Krista Torralva and Gal Tziperman Lotan contributed to this

Richard \"Sam\" Howard died Saturday afternoon after being gravely wounded in a shootout with a suspect Friday night.\n\nIn all, six law enforcement officers were shot Friday night in American cities: two Kissimmee police officers, two Jacksonville County Sheriff's Office deputies and two Pennsylvania State Police officers.\n\nKissimmee Police officer Matthew Baxter was shot and killed, Chief of Police Jeff O'Dell first announced during a news conference shortly after midnight on Saturday. The second officer, Howard, was in \"grave, critical\" condition at Osceola Regional Hospital on Saturday but later passed away.\n\n\"Both are husbands. Both are fathers,\" O'Dell said.\n\nOvernight, police were able to identify the suspected shooter, Everette Glenn Miller, who has since been arrested, O'Dell announced during another news conference at 9 a.m. Saturday. Miller, 45, was charged with murder, carrying a concealed weapon and resisting arrest.\n\nOsceola County Sheriff's Office detectives found Miller at 11:30 p.m. Friday, at Roscoe's Bar & Packaging, 2344 N Orange Blossom Trail, Kissimmee, the chief said.\n\n\"We had a small snipette of video that placed the suspect at the scene at the time of the stop,\" O'Dell said.\n\nMiller reached toward his waistband as detectives approached him, but they were able to tackle him to the ground and arrest him. Miller had a 9 mm handgun and .22 caliber revolver at the time he was arrested.\n\nBaxter, 27, was married to a fellow Kissimmee police officer and had four children. Howard is married with one child.\n\n\"It's a tough time in law enforcement,\" Chief O'Dell says. \"It's getting tough ... these senseless acts are going on.\"\n\nIn Jacksonville, two sheriff's office police officers were shot when responding to a report of an attempted suicide, sheriff's office Director Mike Bruno said during a news conference at 1:30 a.m. Saturday.\n\nKevin Jarrell, a 5-year veteran, was shot in the stomach but was expected to recover, Sheriff Mike Williams said during another news conference Saturday. Michael Fox, an 11-year-veteran, was shot in both his hands and had undergone surgery on Saturday, but was also expected to recover.\n\nBoth officers were listed in stable condition on Saturday.\n\nThe suspect, later identified as Derrick Brabham, 25, had been drinking all night which led to arguments which later led to threats to hurt himself and others in the home. Three women; Brabham's girlfriend, the girlfriend's mother and a family friend, were hiding in a bathroom.\n\nWhen officers arrived, the seven formed a contact team before approaching during which time they saw Brabham and one of the women outside arguing. When the couple reentered the home, the officers heard gunfire.\n\nWhen Gerald and Fox entered the home, the sheriff said, the suspect immediately opened fire on them at close range. The officers returned fire, shooting the suspect twice. Three more officers entered home, taking away their injured fellow officers and then returning to look for the suspect.\n\nThe suspect was found in the hallway, Williams said. The three women were then found as well as Brabham and his girlfriend's 19-month-old baby. The baby had been away from shooting in another room.\n\nBrabham, had no criminal history, the sheriff said. He had been armed with a semi-automatic .223 caliber riffle\n\n\"We often talk about the inherent dangers of police work. Tonight those dangers were all too real for these officers,\" Bruno said. \"As the officers approached the house, they knew it was a rifle the individual was shooting. They knew they were staring danger in the face and yet they moved forward to meet their commitment they held and that they swore to take for this community.\"\n\nTwo Pennsylvania state troopers were shot just after 8 p.m. Friday in the Fairchance Borough of Fayette County, Pa., according to the state police department. The troopers, assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division, had arranged a meeting with a suspect, Clarence Belsar.\n\nBelsar, 26, was suspected of selling property stolen in recent burglaries in the area, police posted Saturday morning on Facebook. When the Pennsylvania troopers approached him, he began to walk away and ignored their commands. When they attempted to stop Belsar, a struggle ensued.\n\nBelsar pulled a handgun and fired one shot, which struck both troopers, police said. The troopers returned fire, shooting Belsar dead.\n\nOne trooper was shot in the hand, treated in a hospital and later released. The other trooper was shot in the abdomen and is in serious condition but expected to recover.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:50:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "dateCrawl":

(WOFL FOX 35) - Governor Rick Scott spoke out today regarding last night's law enforcement related shootings in Kissimmee and Jacksonville that resulted in the loss of Kissimmee Police Officer Matthew Baxter.\n\nTwo state troopers were also shot in Pennsylvania last night.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott said, \"Last night, I learned of two separate incidents in Florida where four law enforcement officers where shot - in Kissimmee and in Jacksonville. We also learned that two state troopers were shot in Pennsylvania as well.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, a member of the Kissimmee Police Department lost his life. Kissimmee Police Department Officer Matthew Baxter was a married father of three and a dedicated law enforcement hero in Central Florida. The violence last night also left another member of the Kissimmee Police Department, Sgt. Sam Howard, in grave condition. We are praying for his recovery and the recovery of all law enforcement injured last night, including the two officers from the Jacksonville Police Department.\"\n\n\"Let me be very clear - last night's violence against our law enforcement community is reprehensible and has no place in our state. Florida has zero tolerance for violence and we will not accept hatred for one second. In Florida, justice is swiftly served against anyone who attacks our law enforcement officers.\"\n\n\"Today, I join every Floridian to honor these law enforcement officers, their brothers and sisters in uniform, and their families. My heart breaks for Matthew's family. May Matthew's service and the service of our law enforcement community be a constant reminder of the sacrifice of those who serve to keep us safe. Following last night's shootings I have been in touch with local law enforcement and community officials to let them know that our state supports them every step of the way.\"\n\n\"The best thing about Florida is the people who live here. Every day I meet peaceful, loving, and thoughtful people who love the Sunshine State. I am proud that we live in a safe state, and our crime rate is at a 46-year low because of our hard-working law enforcement officers.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "18:11:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napoli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "153690", "label": {"eng": "Napoli"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napoli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181844", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "242095", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 5}, {"id": "302557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "score": 5}, {"id": "302966", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence", "score": 4}, {"id": "303464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "score": 3}, {"id": "308747", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "score": 4}, {"id": "313180", "label": {"eng": "Central Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "314552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_officer", "score": 4}, {"id": "330725", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "score": 5}, {"id": "360059", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Sheriff's Office"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Sheriff's_Office", "score": 2}], "image": "http://static.lakana.com/media.fox35orlando.com/photo/2017/08/19/GETTY%20Rick%20Scott%20rezied_1503159076007_3942637_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "timeCrawl": "18:11:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Governor Rick Scott makes a statement on the loss of officers across Florida", "originalArticle": null}

One of those officers died and the other is clinging to life.\n\nKissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell announced that Everett Glenn Miller, 45, was taken into custody last night and is charged with first degree premeditated murder. Miller used to live in the Tampa Bay area. He has past addresses in Tampa, Riverview and Dover.\n\nMiller is accused of shooting Officer Sam Howard, a 10-year veteran of the force, and Officer Matthew Baxter, a 3-year-veteran. The officers had been called to check out a report of suspicious persons in the area of Palmway and Cypress streets, police said.\n\nAbout a half hour later, a 911 caller reported the officers were shot. Rescuers arrived, and the officers were taken to a hospital.\n\nBaxter died, Howard is in critical condition, and his outlook is grave.\n\nO'Dell says the officers apparently were caught by surprise and not able to return fire.\n\nA couple hours after the shooting, police located Miller and when they confronted him, they say he reached for his waistband. That's when the officer tackled him and took him into custody. Miller reportedly had two weapons on him.\n\nMiller was transported to jail in Officer Baxter's handcuffs.\n\nOur solidarity is with @kissimmeepolice as they deal with this tragic loss. -- OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted about the shooting early Saturday.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones.

He left active duty on July 27, 2010.\n\nHe had no criminal record in Florida, Florida Department of Law Enforcement records show, and three minor traffic tickets in Osceola County.\n\nglotan@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5774\n\nSecond Kissimmee Police Officer dies after Friday night shooting \"\n\nInteractive map: Every homicide in Central Florida \"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:41:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1266, "textStart": 1253, "date": "2010-07-27", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373472", "time": "22:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373472", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "181885", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kissimmee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182159", "label": {"eng": "Osceola County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osceola County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302515", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Iron"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "score": 3}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 5}, {"id": "302958", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Murder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "score": 2}, {"id": "303464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "score": 2}, {"id": "303477", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Arrest"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest", "score": 2}, {"id": "304214", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Detective"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "score": 2}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 2}, {"id": "313499", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "score": 3}, {"id": "315405", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "score": 2}, {"id": "321569", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "score": 3}, {"id": "327373", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "score": 2}, {"id": "336771", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Concealed carry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry", "score": 2}, {"id": "365057", "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Law Enforcement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Law_Enforcement", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 1}, {"id": "366326", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Glenn Miller"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Miller", "score": 3}, {"id": "373759", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "9\u00d719mm Parabellum"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9\u00d719mm_Parabellum", "score": 3}, {"id": "496541", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Orange Blossom Trail"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_441_in_Florida#Kissimmee_through_Mount_Dora", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5998b4f4/turbine/os-everett-glenn-miller-arrested-kissimmee-20170819", "timeCrawl": "22:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Veteran Marine accused of shooting two Kissimmee police officers was arrested at nearby bar", "originalArticle": null}

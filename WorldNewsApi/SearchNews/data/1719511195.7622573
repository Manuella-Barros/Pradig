[+] are driving safe vehicles is essential. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Teen drivers have crash rates nearly four times those of drivers 20 and older, so ensuring that they are driving safe vehicles is essential. Reliability and affordability are also important. To guide families, the latest edition of an annual list of recommended used and new vehicles in a range of budgets that can help teens prevent a crash and protect them well if they do, was released on Wednesday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Consumer Reports (CR). \u201cVehicles continue to get safer, and for the first time since the pandemic-era disruptions, prices on the new and used market have stabilized,\u201d Jennifer Stockburger, director of operations at CR\u2019s Auto Test Center, said in a statement. \u201cThese trends have enabled us to point families to even better options this year.\u201d This year\u2019s updated list of recommended used vehicles includes 58 models, divided into two groups \u2013 Best Choices and Good Choices \u2013 ranging in price from $5,800 to $19,900. Vehicles in the top tier also come with standard automatic emergency braking (AEB), particularly important for young, inexperienced ones, who are more prone to mistakes. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see crash avoidance tech like automatic emergency braking filtering through the fleet and into affordable used models, including many priced under $15,000,\u201d Rebecca Weast, Insurance Institute research scientist, said in a statement. \u201cWith a little knowledge and patience, families can find the right vehicle for their new driver without spending all their savings.\u201d The 22 recommended new 2024 models offer state-of-the-art crash protection and crash avoidance, according to the researchers. For a first-time teen driver, both lists recommend only those vehicles that are not too small, too big or too fast.

Mini Cars and other small, light vehicles, which may not provide enough protection in crashes with other vehicles, are not also listed, as are large SUVs and large pickups, as they can be hard to handle and take longer to stop, and pose more risk to pedestrians, bicyclists and people in smaller vehicles. The requirements for used and new vehicles diverge, but recommended vehicles in both groups scored well in the Insurance Institute\u2019s safety tests and performed well in CR\u2019s tests for braking, emergency handling and reliability. New cars also scored well for headlights and pedestrian front crash prevention. This year\u2019s recommended vehicles include one all-electric model, the Hyundai Ioniq 6. EVs are fundamentally as safe as gas-powered vehicles, but there are concerns about rapid acceleration, researchers noted. Unlike gas engines, electric motors give drivers immediate access to all of the vehicle\u2019s power, so extra caution is needed when giving these vehicles to teens.

The Americans, whose only appearance in an ICC event involving Full Members was in the 2004 Champions Trophy, will be making their debut in the T20 World Cup.\n\nTwo-time champions West Indies, on the other hand, will be hoping to make amends after finishing at the bottom of their group comprising Zimbabwe, Ireland and Scotland in the 2022 edition in Australia, failing to reach the Super 12s in the process.\n\nTop-eight teams in 2022 edition\n\nEight teams qualified for the 2024 edition on the basis of their final position at the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup. That includes champions England and runners-up Pakistan, the former winning the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by five wickets to win the tournament for the second time. Finishing among the top four were India and New Zealand, who lost to England and Pakistan respectively in the semi-finals.\n\nAdditionally, the teams that finished third and fourth in their respective groups in the Super 12s qualified for the 2024 edition. Australia and Sri Lanka made the cut in Group 1, as did South Africa and Netherlands in Group 2.\n\nOn the basis of team rankings\n\nAfghanistan and Bangladesh are the only remaining teams to have confirmed their place in the tournament without having to take the qualifier route.\n\nBangladesh and Afghanistan had finished fifth and sixth respectively in their respective groups in the last T20 World Cup, missing out on automatic qualification as a result, but have made the cut as the next two highest-ranked teams on the ICC T20I rankings.\n\nT20 World Cup Qualifiers\n\nThe remaining eight teams entered the tournament via the regional qualifiers. The biggest upset during the qualifiers was Uganda joining Namibia from the African leg after beating Zimbabwe -- who had participated in every edition except 2009 (withdrawn) and 2021 (suspended).\n\nHere are the teams categorised on the basis of their respective regions:", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It is going to be out of this world!\n\nAll you need to know ahead of the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup, which is live in full on Sky Sports between June 1-29...\n\nYep. Seven months after England's atrocious 50-over World Cup title defence in India - at which they lost six of their first seven games and were dumped out in the group stage - and less than two years since they won the T20 version for the second time with victory over Pakistan in the 2022 final in Melbourne, they and 19 other teams are convening in the Caribbean and USA for another global event.\n\nDamn right. For the first time in any Cricket World Cup (T20 or 50 over) matches will be held in the good old US of A, with America and West Indies' joint bid to host the event greenlit by the International Cricket Council in late 2021.\n\nThree American venues will be used throughout the tournament - Central Broward Park in Lauderhill, Florida; the Nassau County Stadium on Long Island, New York; and Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas - with 16 of the 55 matches taking place in the USA, all in the first group stage.\n\nThe temporary arena on Long Island, which has had its pitch flown in from Adelaide, will host the hotly anticipated Pakistan vs India match on Sunday June 9 (3.30pm start UK). The tournament will begin in Dallas on Saturday June 1 as co-hosts USA take on Canada (1.30am on Sunday June 2 UK).\n\nThe six West Indian venues hosting matches are Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe first semi-final is in Trinidad and Tobago and the second in Guyana, with the final, on Saturday June 29, held at Kensington Oval in Barbados.\n\nUSA and West Indies earned their spots as tournament hosts, with America to now compete in the T20 World Cup for the first time. Canada and Uganda will also make their T20 World Cup bows this year after coming through the Americas Qualifier and African Qualifier respectively.\n\nEngland, Pakistan, New Zealand, India, Australia, South Africa, Netherlands and Sri Lanka secured their places by finishing in the top eight of the previous T20 World Cup in 2022, with Afghanistan and Sri Lanka qualifying courtesy of being the next two highest-placed teams in the T20I rankings.\n\nThe 20 sides are separated into four groups of five in the first stage, with each country playing the other teams in their group once each in a round-robin format.\n\nThe top two in each pool advance to the Super 8s, when the remaining eight teams are then split into two groups of four.\n\nTo help with planning, should the eight seeded sides - England, Australia, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa and Sri Lanka - make it into the Super 8s, then their group position will be predetermined, not based on where they finish in the first pool stage.\n\nIf an unseeded team qualifies for the Super 8s, they will take on the seeding of whoever they knocked out. If there are two unseeded qualifiers from the same group, their Super 8 group will be determined by league position.\n\nIn the Super 8s, each team plays the others in their group once, with the top two reaching the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, the winner of Group 1 plays the runner-up in Group 2, with whoever tops Group 2 playing the runner-up in Group 1.\n\nShould either semi-final not be completed due to inclement weather, the higher placed side from the Super 8 phase will progress.\n\nGot all that?!\n\n- There will be no ties in the tournament as if sides are level after 20 overs a Super Over will be contested to determine the winner. If that ends in a tie as well, then Super Overs will continue until a winner is decided.\n\n- Sides earn two points for a win, one for a no result and none for a defeat.\n\n- In the group phases, a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, rising to 10 overs for the semi-finals and final.\n\n- The first semi-final and final have a reserve day to help forge a result in the event of bad weather with the second semi-final having 250 minutes available on the scheduled day.\n\n- If India reach the knockout stage, they will play in the second semi-final as it is at a more friendly time (8pm India) for their county's TV audience than the first semi-final (6am India).\n\nThey look well equipped to challenge, although we thought that ahead of the 50-over World Cup in India last autumn and they ended up having an absolute horror show then!\n\nThere is no Ben Stokes for England this time around with the all-rounder, who played the key innings as his nation won the 2019 50-over World Cup at Lord's and 2022 T20 World Cup in Melbourne.\n\nStokes has made himself unavailable for selection as he focuses on getting back to full fitness after knee surgery and becoming \"the all-rounder I want to be\" across all formats of the game.\n\nEngland's batting is still packed full of big hitters, though, with the likely top six Jos Buttler, Phil Salt, Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone.\n\nBowling is probably their weaker suit, although they do possess the world's top-ranked T20I bowler in leg-spinner Adil Rashid, while paceman Jofra Archer is back in the squad after a nightmare run with injuries since he burst onto the international in 2019 and bowled the Super Over that won England that year's 50-over World Cup.\n\nEngland's T20 World Cup squad: Jos Buttler (captain), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, Mark Wood.\n\nCheck out every squad named so far here.\n\nEvery match is live on Sky Sports, with non-Sky subscribers able to watch contract-free through a NOW Month or Day Membership.\n\nYou can follow the action across Sky Sports' digital platforms with match reports, scorecards, video highlights, features, podcasts and pundit analysis, while we will also bring you live blogs of selected games, including England fixtures and Pakistan vs India.\n\nWest Indies vs Papua New Guinea - Providence, Guyana (3.30pm)\n\nNew Zealand vs Afghanistan - Providence, Guyana (12.30am)\n\nSri Lanka vs Bangladesh - Grand Prairie, Texas (1.30am)\n\nNetherlands vs South Africa - Long Island, New York (3.30pm)\n\nSouth Africa vs Bangladesh - Long Island, New York (3.30pm)\n\nWest Indies vs New Zealand - Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago (1.30am)\n\nBangladesh vs Netherlands - Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (3.30pm)\n\nAfghanistan vs Papua New Guinea - Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago (1.30am)\n\nSouth Africa vs Nepal - Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (12.30am)\n\nNew Zealand vs Uganda - Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago (1.30am)\n\nBangladesh vs Nepal - Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (12.30am)\n\nSri Lanka vs Netherlands - Gros Islet, Saint Lucia (1.30am)\n\nNew Zealand vs Papua New Guinea - Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago (3.30pm)\n\nTuesday June 18\n\nWest Indies vs Afghanistan - Gros Islet, Saint Lucia (1.30am)\n\nC1 vs B2 - Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1.30am)\n\nC1 vs D2 - Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1.30am)\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

One among the many is the host nation USA. The United States of America have previously featured in an ICC tournament but this will be their debut in the mega T20 competition. They will set the tournament rolling on the commencement day and would be looking to inflict some major upsets in the tournament.\n\nWhile the USA could not boost a significant record in cricket but lately they have been active on the scene. They recently squashed Bangladesh in a 3-match T20I series, and would likely carry the momentum in the marquee tournament. It would be intriguing to witness how the USA will fare at the top level, and should they do well, cricket as a sport will benefit.\n\nAlso Read | Ex-Pakistan player's shocking prediction for IND vs

Reuters\n\nThe ninth edition of the T20 World Cup will be getting underway a little over 24 hours from now with the United States of America squaring off against neighbours Canada in the tournament opener in Dallas on Saturday, 1 June.\n\nEngland had won the last edition of the tournament, defeating Pakistan in the 2022 final in front of a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground by five wickets to win the tournament for a second time. They're placed alongside 'Old Enemy' Australia, who had won the tournament in 2021, in Group B.\n\nJoining the Ashes rivals in Group B are Namibia, Oman and Scotland.\n\nBefore the tournament gets underway, we preview the five teams in Group B:\n\nEngland\n\nDefending champions have been one of the most consistent teams in the T20I format, and have made it to the knockouts in each of the last three editions of the T20 World Cup -- finishing runners-up in 2016, reaching the semi-finals in 2021 and winning the tournament in 2022.\n\nEngland registered a 2-0 series victory over Pakistan at home right before boarding the flight for the Caribbean, winning the fourth and final match at The Oval by seven wickets on Thursday.\n\nTheir recent form, coupled with the fact that several of their squad members shone in the recently-concluded IPL, certainly highlights the fact that Jos Buttler and Co are firing on all cylinders at the moment and are likely to reach the knockouts for the fourth edition in a row.\n\nPlayer to watch out for: Jos Buttler\n\nIt's tough singling out one player from a squad that is packed with match-winners. However, how captain Buttler leads from the front could go a long way in shaping England's campaign in the Caribbean.\n\nButtler, after all, was England's leading run-scorer in the 2022 T20 World Cup, scoring 225 runs in six appearances at an average of 45 and a strike rate of 144.23. He had, however, an ODI World Cup to forget the following year, scoring just 138 runs in nine matches at an average of 15.33.\n\nHow Buttler performs at the top of the order, thus will be crucial to England's chances of retaining the title.\n\nSquad: Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonathan Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, Mark Wood\n\nSchedule\n\nvs Scotland on 4 June at 8 pm IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Australia on 8 June at 10.30 pm IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Oman on 14 June at 12.30 am IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nvs Namibia on 16 June at 10.30 pm IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia weren't quite the dominant force in T20s the way they were in Tests and ODIs, having reached the T20 World Cup final just once between the inaugural edition in 2007 and 2016 -- in 2010, in which they lost to England.\n\nThe Aussies finally ended their long wait for a men's T20 world title after the tournament returned to action after a five-year gap in 2021, beating Trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand in the summit clash in Dubai.\n\nThey were in for disappointment the following year, however, as they would fail to reach the semi-finals on home soil, finishing third in their group behind England and New Zealand in the Super 12s.\n\nAustralia have been the dominant force when it comes to ICC events, having won each of the last four events -- the Women's T20 World Cup, Men's World Test Championship and the Men's World Cup in 2023 along with Men's U-19 World Cup this year.\n\nThere's enough reason to believe the Mitchell Marsh-led side can win a fifth ICC title in a row for the most successful cricketing nation of all time.\n\nPlayer to watch out for: Travis Head\n\nHead had played a starring role in Australia's triumphs in last year's World Test Championship as well as the World Cup, scoring match-winning centuries in the final of both tournaments, and certainly is Australia's man for the big occasions. There's no reason to believe he cannot produce the goods for captain Marsh and his team in the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup.\n\nHead had been in explosive form for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the recently-concluded IPL, finishing as their top run-scorer with 567 runs at an average of 40.50 and an explosive strike rate of 191.55. He had formed a successful opening partnership with India's Abhishek Sharma at the top of the order, the two playing a key role in SRH's journey to the final where they lost against Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nHis current form, along with his success in ICC events, certainly makes him one to watch out for.\n\nSquad: Mitchell Marsh (c), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade (wk), David Warner, Adam Zampa.\n\nSchedule\n\nvs Oman on 6 June at 6 am IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs England on 8 June at 10.30 pm IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Namibia on 12 June at 6 am IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nvs Scotland on 16 June at 6 am IST at Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia\n\nNamibia\n\nThe Namibians will be making only their third appearance in an ICC World Cup, having previously appeared in an ODI World Cup and a T20 World Cup in 2003 and 2021 respectively. While they had failed to advance beyond the group stage in 2003, they had punched above their weight to reach the Super 12s in 2021.\n\nThe Gerhard Erasmus-led side enter the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup after winning the African Qualifier by finishing at the top of the seven-team tournament with six wins in as many matches -- the only side to finish with a 100 per cent record.\n\nPlayer to watch out for: David Wiese\n\nThe former South Africa seam-bowling all-rounder was part of the Namibian side that had advanced to the Super 12s in the 2021 edition, starring in their victories over Netherlands and Ireland in the group stage.\n\nGiven he turned 39 earlier this month, this likely will be his final appearance in an ICC event, and Wiese will be hoping to make it an occasion to remember. Wiese's been in excellent form of late as well, scoring 119 runs at an average of 59.50 and collecting five wickets at an economy of 7.58 in Namibia's 3-2 series win over Oman in a T20I series preceding the World Cup.\n\nSquad: Gerhard Erasmus (c), Zane Green, Michael Van Lingen, Dylan Leicher, Ruben Trumpelmann, Jack Brassell, Ben Shikongo, Tangeni Lungameni, Niko Davin, JJ Smit, Jan Frylinck, JP Kotze, David Wiese, Bernard Scholtz, Malan Kruger and PD Blignaut.\n\nSchedule\n\nvs Oman on 3 June at 6 am IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Scotland on 7 June at 12.30 am IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Australia on 12 June at 6 am IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nvs England on 15 June at 10.30 pm IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nOman\n\nOman will be making their third appearance at the T20 World Cup, having previously participated in the 2016 and 2021 editions where they failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\nThey had qualified for the 2021 edition as co-hosts alongside the UAE, and have made it to the 2024 edition as champions of the Asian qualifiers. They had beaten Nepal -- the other qualifying team from Asia -- in thrilling fashion in the final that took place in Kirtipur, Nepal in November last year and went into a Super Over.\n\nMore recently, Oman gave Namibia a tough fight in a five-match T20I series at home that preceded the T20 World Cup. They were 2-1 up at one point in the series before the Namibians fought back, winning the fourth and fifth matches to take the series 3-2.\n\nWicketkeeper-batter Naseem Khushi's form, however, stood out in that series as the opener scored 149 runs\n\nPlayer to watch out for: Aqib Ilyas\n\nOman captain Aqib Ilyas was one of the key reasons for his team winning the Asian qualifier and securing their place in the tournament. The Pakistani-born spin-bowling all-rounder had collected 10 wickets at an economy of 5.66 during that tournament.\n\nMore recently, he was in good nick with both bat and ball during the T20I series against Namibia at home, collecting 143 runs at an average and a strike rate of 35.75 and 140.19 respectively besides collecting six wickets at an average and economy of 15 and 5.29 respectively.\n\nSquad: Aqib Ilyas (c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Kashyap Prajapati, Pratik Athavale (wk), Ayaan Khan, Shoaib Khan, Mohammad Nadeem, Naseem Khushi (wk), Mehran Khan, Bilal Khan, Rafiullah, Kaleemullah, Fayyaz Butt, Shakeel Ahmad.\n\nSchedule\n\nvs Namibia on 3 June at 6 am IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Australia on 6 June at 6 am IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Scotland on 9 June at 10.30 pm IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nvs England on 14 June at 12.30 am IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nScotland\n\nScotland had their first appearance in a global event in the 1999 ODI World Cup, where they had also hosted two matches in Edinburgh. Since then, they've been part of two more ODI World Cups (2007 and 2015) and five T20 World Cups (2007, 2009, 2016, 2021 and 2022).\n\nTheir best performance till date was advancing to the second round of the 2021 T20 World Cup after topping Group B, defeating Test-playing nation Bangladesh along the way.\n\nAs for their T20 World Cup qualification -- they finished among the top two teams in the European qualifier alongside Ireland before defeating them by eight runs in the final to be crowned champions of the tournament. Scotland finished with six wins in as many outings, the only team to remain unbeaten throughout their campaign.\n\nPlayer to watch out for: Bradley Currie\n\nLeft-arm seamer Currie was the top wicket-taker in the European Qualifier, collecting 12 wickets at a stunning average and economy of 8 and 4.80 respectively along with a strike-rate of 10.\n\nSquad: Richie Berrington (c), Matthew Cross, Brad Currie, Chris Greaves, Oli Hairs, Jack Jarvis, Michael Jones, Michael Leask, Brandon McMullen, George Munsey, Safyaan Sharif, Chris Sole, Charlie Tear, Mark Watt and Brad Wheal.\n\nSchedule\n\nvs England on 4 June at 8 pm IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Namibia on 7 June at 12.30 am IST at Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nvs Oman on 9 June at 10.30 pm IST at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nvs Australia on 16 June at 6 am IST at Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

USA will co-host the ninth edition of the marquee event along with West Indies. USA are brimming with confidence on the back of two back-to-back dominating series wins against Canada and Bangladesh in the lead-up. Canada have been a strong associate nation for quite some time and an exciting clash is in the offing.\n\nThis will be a Group A fixture that features Ireland, Pakistan and one of the tournament favourites, India. Only the top two from each of the four groups will make the knockouts and both teams will look to begin with a win. The ICC Men's T20 World Cup which starts in June, comes to a grand conclusion on 29 June 2024. A total of 20 teams, including nine associate nations and 11 ICC full-members are set to vie for top honours in the prestigious tournament.\n\nTeam USA mark their entry into the big league of international T20 cricket on the back of dominating performances and back-to-back series wins over Canada (4-0) and full ICC member nation Bangladesh (2-1). Enjoying home advantage, Team USA have displayed the capability to spring surprises against established teams.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages that plays in favour of the USA is awareness of home conditions. Capitalizing on their familiarity with the playing conditions is one factor that teams will lack. USA's squad for the highly anticipated tournament is a healthy mix of experience and youth. the team has been gearing up under the experienced Australian coach Stuart Law.\n\nTheir recent encounters with Canada and Bangladesh on home soil have given them much-needed match exposure in high-pressure games. They however will face challenges from Asian Giants Pakistan and India.

When's India vs Pakistan and where? Al Jazeera answers your questions.\n\nCricket's biggest tournament is making its way to North America.\n\nThe tournament has been expanded to include 20 teams for the first time, up from 16 teams in the 2022 edition.\n\nThe top eight teams from the previous edition and the two host nations, USA and West Indies, earned direct entry.\n\nAfghanistan and Bangladesh qualified on the basis of their ICC T20 rankings on the cut-off date in November 2022.\n\nThe remaining six teams emerged from regional qualification tournaments that took place last year across the Americas, Africa, Asia, Asia Pacific and Europe.\n\nUSA, Papua New Guinea and Uganda will make their debut at an ICC World Cup.\n\nThe ICC has not confirmed the official line-up of the opening ceremony ahead of the first match between USA and Canada on June 1 at 7:30pm local time (00:30 GMT) in Dallas. However, there has been widespread promotion for a pre-match event on June 2, when co-hosts West Indies play Papua New Guinea in Guyana at 10:30am local time (14:30 GMT).\n\nThe tournament will be divided into two group-based rounds and a knockout round that will commence with the semifinals.\n\nThe 20 teams will be divided into four groups and following the round-robin matches, the top two teams from each group will advance to the Super Eight.\n\nThe four teams in each group will play against each other once in the Super Eight phase. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals.\n\nThe tournament will be played at nine venues - three in the US and six across the West Indies.\n\nNew York, Texas and Florida will play host to the 16 matches being played in the US, with New York bagging half of those, including the marquee India vs Pakistan clash.\n\nThe six Caribbean nations that will host 39 matches are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nIndia vs Pakistan is the biggest match of any ICC World Cup and one that is now a permanent fixture regardless of groups and seedings, which means every time the two nations participate in an ICC men's event, they face each other at least once.\n\nWhenever and wherever the South Asian rivals meet, tickets sell out in record time, hotels run at full occupancy and life in both countries comes to a standstill.\n\nThis time, the fixture has been assigned to New York, the bustling hub of the South Asian diaspora on the East Coast. It is scheduled for June 9 at 10:30am (14:30 GMT) at the purpose-built modular stadium in Nassau County, Long Island.\n\nThe state of New York has beefed up its security cover ahead of the big clash, with one police official saying it is the \"largest security we've ever had to do\".\n\nTickets for the match were sold out within a few hours of going on sale, while resale platforms are asking for anything between $1,000 to $5,000 per seat.\n\nThe ICC has not confirmed the prize money for the 2024 edition of the tournament, but previous winners England walked away with $1.6m in 2022.\n\nTickets for the tournament went on sale in February via a public ballot, with prices beginning at $6 and going up to hundreds of dollars.\n\nTickets for some group matches and Super Eight matches are still available on the tournament website.\n\nThe ICC has allotted rights to various broadcasting and online streaming outlets across the world.\n\nAl Jazeera will run extensive coverage of the tournament with pretournament news, previews, key information as well as live updates for the biggest matches, followed by post-match reaction, analysis and everything else you'd need to know about the T20 World Cup.\n\nIt's a simple game of bat and ball, involving 11 players in each team but the rules can get a little complicated. Al Jazeera breaks it down for you here.\n\nNow that you know everything about the sport, why not test yourself with our simple cricket quiz?", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

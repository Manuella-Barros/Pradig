Scrumhalf Alex Mitchell broke Bath hearts with a fine score following a brilliant break by substitute George Hendy to clinch victory for Northampton, after Bath had battled back from a 22nd-minute red card for Beno Obano. The England prop, who stayed high as he clattered into Northampton number eight Juarno Augustus, left referee Christophe Ridley with little choice and Bath with a mountain to climb. Northampton opened up a healthy 15-3 lead through tries from wingers Tommy Freeman and Ollie Sleightholme, and seemed set to march to the title before Bath put in a second-half performance for the ages. \"Scoring that try was massive, I was just there to finish it off after George Hendy took on about five other boys, I didn\u2019t have to do much,\" Mitchell said. \"We were actually a bit off it today but we found a way and now we\u2019re champions so I\u2019m delighted,\" the England scrumhalf added. Prop Thomas du Toit had given Bath hope just before the break, barrelling over from short range to drag the deficit back to 15-10 after Finn Russell nailed the touchline conversion. Behind on the scoreboard and down a player, Bath needed to start the second half strong and their talisman Russell duly delivered, earning a penalty with a lovely dummy and half-break that forced Saints into a breakdown infringement. MAVERICK PLAYMAKER The maverick playmaker was on top form, exemplified by a pinpoint 50-22 touchfinder to keep the pressure on and Bath levelled the scores at 18-18 when Will Muir leapt to claim a high kick and crosse the line. Bath dominated the second half, their snarling energy in the tackle fouling the gears of the usually well-oiled Saints attack. Russell dragged them ahead with a penalty on 65 minutes to make it 21-18 and an upset looked on the cards before Saints finally clicked through Hendy and Mitchell. As smoke drifted over the stadium and Northampton lifted the trophy, they could reflect on a title well earned over the course of a season in which they topped the table and frequently thrilled with their slick running and passing game. Bath, meanwhile, can reflect once the pain has subsided on a remarkable journey from the nadir of two seasons ago when they finished bottom of the table. Coach Johann van Graan has moulded a much more resilient side since, aided by the recruitment of Russell and a host of top talent from the now defunct Worcester Warriors, including centre Ollie Lawrence and back-row workhorse Ted Hill. \"What a game of rugby from our side, we were tough to beat today but congratulations to Saints, I can't be more proud of my team,\" Van Graan said. \"To play for 60 minutes with 14 men in a final makes it extremely difficult but we are one group united, we'll stick around Beno Obano.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/northampton-edge-out-14-man-bath-thriller-win-title-4396826", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--6g3jGy6v--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-06-08t161301z_1_lynxmpek5708e_rtroptp_3_rugby-unon-england", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:21:08", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.169}

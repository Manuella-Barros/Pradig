As a sector, we will ensure women's emancipation remains one of our key focus areas, in line with government's constitutional responsibility and national priority to protect, promote and advance the rights of women in all areas of the economy.\n\nResponsibilities of national government and municipalities with regard to water and sanitation\n\nThe Constitution, National Water Act and the Water Services Act clearly define roles and responsibilities for the management of water resources and for providing water services in our country. The Department of Water and Sanitation is responsible for:\n\nThe Water Boards are entities under the Minister of Water and Sanitation that are established in terms of the Water Services Act to assist municipalities with bulk potable water infrastructure and services.\n\nThe provision of local water and sanitation services is the Constitutional and legal responsibility of municipalities.\n\nFirst month of office\n\nSince being sworn in on 3 July, we have been inundated with calls and messages from the public and local and provincial political leaders regarding challenges with water and sanitation service delivery at local level. These challenges have included a lack of access to water, sewage pollution, and disruptions in water supply for various reasons.\n\nWhat has struck us about many of these calls is that the callers do not seem to appreciate that the provision of water services is the responsibility of municipalities, not the national Department of Water and Sanitation.\n\nIt will be a priority for us to correct this misunderstanding and to encourage communities and community leaders to hold their municipalities accountable for the delivery of water and sanitation services. We will undertake community outreach programmes to educate communities to understand these roles and responsibilities.\n\nNotwithstanding that this is the responsibility of municipalities, we have a call centre to receive complaints and queries about all aspects of water and sanitation in the country. The call centre number is 0800 200 200.\n\nWhen we receive calls related to the responsibilities of the national department or the water boards, we ensure that these issues are dealt with.\n\nThe first point of call for residents to raise issues regarding municipal water and sanitation services must be their municipalities. However, when we receive calls related to water and sanitation services which are the responsibility of municipalities, we refer these to the relevant municipalities to resolve.\n\nAgain, it is important to note that it is only the municipalities which can resolve these issues - the national Department cannot do maintenance or repairs to municipal infrastructure on behalf of a municipality.\n\nDuring our first 30 days we have also had the opportunity to present the Department of Water and Sanitation Budget Vote Policy Statement for the 2024/2025 financial year to Parliament, followed by a series of appearances before various parliamentary committees.\n\nIn addition, we have also met and had robust engagements with our seven water boards on their plans, the projects they are undertaking, and the challenges they face in their effort to provide potable bulk water services to their customers, who are municipalities and industries within their areas of service.\n\nKey challenges in the water and sanitation sector\n\nThe water sector is facing many challenges, and many of our citizens are suffering from not having access to clean water or to safe and dignified sanitation, and from frequent water supply disruptions and sewage spillages.\n\nRaw water supply\n\nSouth Africa is one of the thirty most water-scarce countries in the world, yet our average consumption of water is 218 litres per capita per day, compared to the international average of 173 litres per capita per day. We have already captured 75% of the available surface water in dams, and the remaining opportunities for capturing surface water are expensive. At the same time, the demand for water in South Africa is increasing, as a result of population growth and economic growth.\n\nLack of access to water and sanitation services\n\nThe average national access to at least an RDP level of water service has increased from approximately 60% in 1994 to approximately 90% currently. This is a major achievement.\n\nHowever, it does not mean that 90% of all communities in all areas have access to water. Some communities have 100% access, while some have 0% access. Communities are often forced to obtain water from sources which are polluted, and which sometimes contain dangerous animals.\n\nDeteriorating municipal water and sanitation services\n\nThe Blue, Green and No Drop reports issued by the department in December 2023 indicated that the quality and reliability of municipal water and sanitation services have deteriorated markedly over the last ten years.\n\nFor example, the Blue Drop report found that the percentage of water supply systems with poor or bad microbiological water quality compliance (i.e., water that is not safe to drink) increased from 5% in 2014 to 46% in 2023, resulting in increased risk of water-borne diseases.\n\nThe 2022 Green Drop Report found that 40% of waste water treatment systems were in a critical state of performance, compared to 30% in 2013. It also found that 90 of the 144 water services authorities had at least one critical wastewater system.\n\nDysfunctional municipal wastewater systems are resulting in pollution of communities, rivers, and the environment, resulting in intolerable living conditions and increased risk of life-threatening diseases such as cholera. It is also resulting in damage to tourism and services industries.\n\nThe No Drop report found that the national average for municipal non-revenue water increased from 37% in 2014 to 47% in 2023. The implications of this include:\n\na) that money spent to develop dams and water treatment works is wasted if a large portion of the water is thrown away through leaks in municipal water distribution systems; and\n\nb) that municipalities with high non-revenue water are unable to pay water boards for treated water supplied by them and cannot afford to properly maintain and operate their water distribution infrastructure.\n\nThe main causes of high non-revenue water include:\n\na) high physical losses of water due to leaks in municipal distribution systems, which in turn are caused by ageing infrastructure and neglect of maintenance by municipalities;\n\nb) illegal connections; and\n\nc) weak municipal billing and revenue collection systems.\n\nFinancial sustainability\n\nApart from the grants which the national government provides to municipalities to address water and sanitation infrastructure backlogs and to provide free basic water to the indigent, the water sector has to be self-financing through revenues from the sale of water.\n\nHowever, by May 2024, the debts owed by municipalities to water boards had reached R21.3 billion. The water boards do not receive money from the fiscus and this debt is threatening their ongoing financial viability, as well as the financial viability of the whole sector.\n\nAddressing the challenges\n\nEnsuring water security\n\nTo ensure that the availability of water does not become a constraint to investment and economic growth, and to ensure that there is sufficient water to meet the needs of our population as mandated by the Constitution, we will be focusing on three key priorities over the term of this government.\n\nFirstly, we will ensure that there is timeous investment in additional national water resource infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, we will focus on diversifing the water mix, and increasingly make more use of other sources of water, including the sustainable use of groundwater, water re-use, and seawater desalination.\n\nThirdly, we will implement more effective water conservation and demand management programmes to bring our water consumption per capita levels in line with, or below, the international average, and to ensure that industries use water as sparingly as possible.\n\nDeveloping national water resource infrastructure\n\nSince 1994, the Department of Water and Sanitation has built 18 new dams. These include the Qedusizi, Bivane, Braamhoek, and Spring Grove dams in KZN; the De Bos, Ceres Koekedouw and Berg Rivier dams in the Western Cape; the Boschmanskop, Driekoppies, Injaka, and Kettingspruit dams in Mpumalanga; Setumo Dam in North West; Bedford Dam in Free State; Nandoni and de Hoop dams in Limpopo; Katse and Mohale Dams (jointly with the Lesotho government) in Lesotho; and Maguga Dam in eSwatini (jointly with the eSwatini government).\n\nIn addition to these projects, there are currently 15 other major national water resource infrastructure projects to a value of more than R100 billion in different stages of implementation around the country. Some of these projects involve raising the walls of existing dams, and others involve the construction of new dams.\n\nMany of these projects were delayed for a long period of time, but they have now all been unblocked, and it will be a priority for us to ensure that they are all implemented expeditiously. The projects are:\n\nMost of these projects are financed off-budget, through raising money in the financial markets. To enable us to increase such fund-raising, the previous Parliament passed the National Water Resource Infrastructure Agency (NWRIA) Bill, which is now awaiting the signature of the President. Establishment of the NWRIA will be one of priorities over the coming year.\n\nTo improve the management of our water catchments to ensure water security, we will be finalising the remaining board appointments for the six Catchment Management Agencies and assisting them to become fully established and functional.\n\nIncreasing access to water and sanitation services\n\nAs indicated previously, it is the Constitutional responsibility of municipalities to ensure access to reliable clean drinking water and safe and dignified sanitation.\n\nTo assist municipalities to implement this responsibility, national government provides municipalities with grants to address backlogs in access, most of which were inherited from apartheid. These grants include the Municipal Infrastructure Grant which is allocated to municipalities by COGTA, the Human Settlements Development Grant which is allocated to metropolitan municipalities by DHS, and the Regional Bulk Infrastructure (RBIG) Grant and Water Services Infrastructure Grant (WSIG) which are allocated to non-metropolitan municipalities by DWS.\n\nIn this term it will be a priority for us to continue to work with municipalities to ensure that they prioritise projects to increase access using their RBIG and WSIG allocations.\n\nFor example, the main bulk pipeline to supply raw water from Nandoni Dam to Nsami Dam near Giyani was completed last year. This has enabled sufficient water to be supplied to the Mopani District Municipality to enable it to provide access to piped clean drinking water to its residents who currently do not have access.\n\nThe Department has now allocated RBIG and WSIG funds to the District Municipality to enable it to upgrade the Giyani Water Treatment Works and to install bulk pipelines and reticulation pipelines, bulk reservoirs, service reservoirs and reticulation to households. Water has started to flow to households in 9 villages in Giyani and we will strive to ensure a further 15 villages receive water by the end of this year, and that a further 31 villages receive water within the next two years.\n\nThe uMngeni-uThukela Water Board in KZN is assisting a number of districts to implement various water supply schemes to increase access to piped clean drinking water for local communities. This includes the R9.5 billion Mandlakazi Bulk Water Supply Scheme under Zululand District Municipality and uMkhanyakude District Municipality (including the Jozini, Big 5 Hlabisa, uMhlabuyalingana and Mtubatuba Local Municipalities). The work involves the construction of infrastructure to abstract water from Jozini Dam and supply it to neighbouring communities.\n\nIn Mpumalanga, DWS is implementing the R1.7 billion Loskop Regional Bulk Water Supply project, which involves the construction of a bulk pipeline from Loskop Dam to Thembisile Hani Local Municipality for domestic water supply. The cross-boundary bulk pipeline will also supply water to previously unserved communities in the Moutse-East area under the Sekhukhune District Municipality in Limpopo.\n\nThe Department is also supporting the Mnquma Municipality in the Eastern Cape to provide water to unserved communities, through the R370 million Nqamakhwe Regional Bulk Water Scheme.\n\nIn partnership with the mining sector, DWS is implementing the R27 billion Olifants River Water Resource Development Project in Limpopo. The project will result in water being provided to the mines to enable mining expansion. It will also result in water being provided to previously unserved communities adjacent to the bulk pipelines being built in the Sekhukhune and Mokgalakwena municipalities.\n\nSimilarly in the Northern Cape, DWS is implementing the R10 billion Vaal Gamagara Phase Two Project in partnership with the mines, to provide additional water for mining and to provide water to previously unserved communities along the bulk pipeline.\n\nSupporting municipalities to improve municipal water and sanitation services\n\nWe would like to emphasise that we will continue to carry out the Drop assessments every two years, because they play an essential role in providing citizens with information about the state of their water and sanitation services, as well as providing municipalities with detailed information about the causes of poor services and what needs to be done to address them.\n\nAlong with COGTA, National Treasury and DHS, DWS will continue to support municipalities to improve their water and sanitation services in several ways. It will assist municipalities to improve their water services planning through the development of Five-Year Water and Sanitation Reliability Plans, Water and Sanitation Master Plans, and Water Services Development Plans.\n\nOne of our immediate priorities will be to visit all the provinces to meet with Water Services Authorities, to review progress with existing improvement plans which are supported by the department, and to assist the municipalities to develop additional improvement plans where necessary. As well as using the RBIG and WSIG grants to assist municipalities to address backlogs in access, DWS will continue to allocate these grants to municipalities to assist them to improve the reliability and capacity of their existing infrastructure.\n\neThekwini and Gauteng water supply disruptions\n\nOne of the main underlying causes of the increasing water supply disruptions that have been experienced in eThekwini and Gauteng is a shortage of raw water in both areas, which DWS is addressing through the construction of the new Polihali Dam in Lesotho and the uMkhomazi Water Project in KZN.\n\nIn the meantime, we will continue to work closely with eThekwini and the municipalities in Gauteng to encourage them to improve the maintenance and performance of their municipal water distribution infrastructure, such as by building additional reservoirs and pumping stations to improve the resilience of their systems, and by reducing leaks.\n\nTo reduce the risk of water supply disruptions until the new dams are built, we will also be supporting eThekwini and the Gauteng municipalities to reduce demand through implementing large-scale awareness campaigns to use water sparingly.\n\nHammanskraal water supply\n\nWe will continue to support the City of Tshwane to address the lack of piped clean drinking water in Hammanskraal. This support has resulted in the City being able to make progress with the repair and upgrading of the Rooiwal Wastewater Treatment Works to address the sewage pollution in the Apies River and to enable the Temba Water Treatment Works to become functional again.\n\nIn the meantime, by October this year, Magalies Water will complete the construction of phase one of a 'package plant' to enable an alternative source of piped clean drinking water to start to be provided to Hammanskraal.\n\nEmfuleni sewage pollution\n\nIn Emfuleni Local Municipality, we will continue with the Section 63 (of the Water Services Act) Intervention through Rand Water to address sewerage pollution in the Vaal. Good progress has been made in refurbishing and repairing sewage pump stations, unblocking sewer lines, repairing collapsed sewer lines, as well as repairing and refurbishing waste water treatment works. This has substantially reduced sewage pollution in residential areas in Emfuleni.\n\nThe main remaining work is to upgrade the capacity of the major wastewater treatment works in the area, and these projects are currently in the procurement phase.\n\nDuring this financial year, we will also be supporting Rand Water and Emfuleni Local Municipality to implement a decision by the Council of the Emfuleni Municipality to establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to be the Water Service Provider in the municipality in future. It is envisaged that this SPV will have the capability to provide water and sanitation services that meet national minimum norms and standards.\n\nImproving water services in rural municipalities\n\nDWS is also providing support for the planning, funding, implementation, and monitoring of municipal water and sanitation projects in a number of rural provinces, including:\n\nThe Department will prioritise the completion of the delayed remaining Bucket Eradication Programme projects in the Northern Cape and Free State. Of 33 projects which formed part of the programme in the Free State, 26 are completed (eradicating approximately 32 000 buckets). Approximately ten thousand buckets remain to be eradicated in the seven incomplete projects. Of 30 projects which formed part of the programme in the Northern Cape, 29 are completed (eradicating approximately 12 000 buckets) and 596 buckets remain to be eradicated in the one incomplete project.\n\nHowever, the programme will not result in the eradication of the undignified and repugnant bucket system altogether from the South African landscape. This is because the programme only focuses on eradicating buckets in certain towns in certain provinces where they were identified in 2012. Since then, and on an ongoing basis, other municipalities elsewhere have introduced buckets systems in formal and informal settlements. The eradication of buckets is therefore a moving target.\n\nIn order to address this, Cabinet has recently approved a National Sanitation Framework which will provide the basis for the Department to issue new national minimum norms and standards for sanitation which will prohibit the use of the bucket system in both formal and informal settlements.\n\nWorking together with the Water Research Commission, the Department is developing new safe, dignified, on-site and non-sewered sanitation systems. These solutions will use much less water than water-borne sewered sanitation systems, which is necessary in a water scarce country such as South Africa. Such systems will need to be implemented by municipalities.\n\nStrengthening partnerships in the water sector\n\nIn line with the President Cyril Ramaphosa's call to strengthen collaboration and social compacts with the private sector, labour, civil society and government, the Ministry of Water and Sanitation will continue to collaborate with all sectors, especially the private sector, to contribute to resolving our country's water and sanitation challenges.\n\nOperation Vulindlela remains a critical intervention to remove all barriers to economic growth and investment. In this regard, we have managed to remove most of the delays in water use licensing.\n\nIn addition to partnerships with mining houses for water supply projects, DWS is also facilitating partnerships between the private sector and municipalities, through its Water Partnerships Office, which we established in collaboration with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA). This includes finalising plans with the eThekwini, Mangaung, Buffalo City, Nelson Mandela Bay and Tshwane municipalities to mobilise private sector finance for the replacement of leaking municipal water distribution pipes which are resulting in high levels of non-revenue water.\n\nReform of municipal water and sanitation services\n\nOne of our immediate priorities will be to work with our colleagues in Cabinet, particularly the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, to find a solution to the problem of the financial sustainability of the water sector.\n\nDespite the high level of support that we are providing to municipalities, in general municipal water and sanitation services continue to decline. To address this, we will shortly be presenting the Water Services Amendment Bill to Cabinet for approval for it to be submitted to Parliament.\n\nThe Amendment Bill provides for the introduction of an operating license system for Water Services Providers, to enable Water Services Authorities to ensure that their Water Services Providers have a minimum level of capability to provide water and sanitation services that meet national norms and standards.\n\nThe amendments propose that this should be done through the introduction of an operating license requirement for Water Services Providers, to ensure that they have a minimum level of competency.\n\nThe Bill also introduces measures to enable the national department to take regulatory action against municipalities which do not comply with national minimum norms and standards for water services.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to make it clear that it is my intention to ensure that there is continuity of the various reforms that are aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the water sector.\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nWisane Mavasa\n\nSpokesperson for the Department of Water and

In March, residents in some parts of Johannesburg endured 11 days of water cuts after a lightning strike at Rand Water's Eikenhof pump station. Apparently lightning strikes twice as a week later another strike at the same location slowed recovery of the reservoir system. In July, despite the erratic service, residents' municipal water bills went up 7.7%. In Joburg, water cuts and higher prices have become routine.\n\nThe city is just another example of the collapse of water services across the country.\n\nThe burden on consumers\n\nMunicipalities are the primary providers of water services to communities. However, instead of ensuring efficient and sustainable water supply, many have resorted to externalising their costs. This practice directly impacts consumers, who face escalating water tariffs.\n\nIn many cases, these increases are not proportionate to the quality or reliability of the water services provided. In fact, in the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) Blue Drop and Green Drop reports in 2023, it was clear that the quality and health of municipal water supply and wastewater was severely declining. These reports stated, amongst other things, that 46% of drinking water did not comply with microbiological standards, posing a health threat to its consumers, and more than 80% of wastewater treatment works do not comply with clean discharge standards, polluting our water resources.\n\nThe reasons behind these tariff hikes are manifold.\n\nPoor infrastructure maintenance leads to frequent breakdowns and water losses, which municipalities then pass on to consumers through higher service charges. Additionally, there is a significant issue with non-revenue water - water that is produced but not billed due to leaks, theft, or metering inaccuracies. Instead of addressing these inefficiencies, municipalities often opt for the easier route of raising tariffs to cover the shortfall.\n\nFor example, the City of Johannesburg's water utility Johannesburg Water reported in its annual report for 2022/23 (the most recent available) that the level of non-revenue water was 46.11% (R3.4 billion) in 2022/23, up from 44.79% in 2022/23. The City's budget for 2024/25 records that the water tariffs it charges customers increased by 9.75% in 2022/23, by 9.3% in 2023/24 and by 7.7% in 2024/25, indicating that the cost of the water losses is being passed on to customers.\n\nLoss is a reality of service delivery, but the acceptable limit and global average is 20%. This is a national problem: the DWS's No Drop report in 2023 says 46.4% of water nationally is non-revenue water and blames the increase in the previous three years on \"the COVID-19 pandemic, deteriorating, and collapsing municipalities\".\n\nWhere municipal services decline, consumers are forced to buy bottled water, walk to water tankers or get water from rivers and dams, erect back-up water supply tanks, drill boreholes and install and maintain water purification systems whilst they are still paying ever-increasing connection levies and water and sanitation tariffs.\n\nJoburg Water's annual report 2022/23 records that it spent about R122 million on water tankers in 2022/23 (up from R91 million the previous year), but a common complaint during water outages is that tankers never arrive or there aren't enough. Tankers are not listed in the annual budget, indicating the City's haphazard approach to providing water during service breaks.\n\nMisallocation of resources\n\nFinancial mismanagement and corruption are rampant within many municipalities. Funds allocated for infrastructure development and maintenance are often misappropriated or squandered on inflated contracts and substandard projects. In fact, some projects were paid for, but no infrastructure existed. This not only drains municipal coffers but also means that necessary upgrades to water infrastructure are delayed or never happen. Consequently, the system remains inefficient, and the costs of these inefficiencies are ultimately borne by the consumer.\n\nExternalising costs to the Department of Water and Sanitation\n\nThe DWS is tasked with overseeing the country's water resources and ensuring that municipalities meet their service delivery obligations. However, due to the pervasive inefficiencies at the municipal level, the DWS often finds itself intervening to prevent service delivery failures. This includes providing emergency funding, technical assistance, and sometimes even taking over the management of water services in particularly dysfunctional municipalities. In November 2023, the DWS gave Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation an overview of interventions in municipalities, which included advising municipalities on improving project management and avoiding under-expenditure, and bringing in water boards to assist municipalities in getting projects going, yet many municipalities still failed to implement projects effectively.\n\nWhat causes greater concern is the extent to which municipalities abuse this process, knowing that if they allocate inefficient budgets or fail to provide sufficient water services, the DWS must intervene and come to their aid. This opens up municipal water revenue to abuse. One can only wonder what these funds have been used for at the expense of municipal consumers.\n\nSuch interventions place an enormous strain on the DWS's already limited resources. Instead of focusing on long-term strategic planning and development, the department is bogged down with crisis management. The financial burden of these interventions is substantial and diverts funds away from critical national water projects and, in the end, a lot of the municipal projects are handed back to the culprits who caused the problems.\n\nThe need for accountability and reform\n\nTo address these issues, a multifaceted approach is needed.\n\nFirstly, there must be greater accountability at the municipal level. This includes stringent oversight mechanisms to ensure that funds are used appropriately and that there is transparency in financial reporting. Anti-corruption measures must be robust, with severe penalties for those found guilty of misappropriating public funds or negligently polluting our water resources through inadequate wastewater management.\n\nSecondly, investment in infrastructure must be prioritised and executed. This includes both the repair and maintenance of existing systems and the development of new infrastructure to meet the growing demand. Innovative solutions such as water recycling and desalination should also be explored to diversify our water sources.\n\nThirdly, capacity building is essential. Many municipalities lack the technical expertise required to manage complex water systems effectively. Training programmes and the hiring of skilled personnel can help bridge this gap.\n\nFourth, transparency with regards to drinking water quality is essential. Consumers have a right to know what they are drinking and whether wastewater is treated and discharged at required standards as they pay for a specified and regulated quality of drinking water and sanitation. In July, OUTA's WaterCAN initiative raised concern that municipalities were not warning the public about contaminated water and named 11 municipalities as particularly problematic (see here). When there is a breakdown in service and supply, inadequate communication and inefficient efforts to repair result in communities panicking. The trust breakdown leads to rumours filling the void, residents worrying about water quality, and those who can afford to get off the system doing so, reducing revenue to the entity.\n\nFifth, there should be a concerted effort to involve communities in water management. When consumers are part of the decision-making process, there is greater transparency, and it becomes easier to address local issues promptly.\n\nLastly, water and sanitation revenue should be ring-fenced towards its intended purpose to fix this dire problem. Currently municipalities use this revenue to fund other spending, despite the collapse of this infrastructure.\n\nThe way forward\n\nThe abuse of authority by municipalities and the externalisation of water service costs onto consumers and the DWS is a significant barrier to achieving sustainable water management in South Africa. By implementing reforms that promote accountability, transparency, and efficiency, we can ensure that our water resources are managed more effectively, benefiting both consumers and the broader environment. It is imperative that we tackle these issues head-on to secure a water-secure future for all South Africans and this is an area with very room for failure.\n\nAll stakeholders - government, civil society, and the private sector need to take serious action to drive these necessary changes before it's too late. Only through good and transparent leadership, collective action and individual accountability can we overcome the challenges facing our water services and build a system that truly serves the people.", "source": {"uri": "greenbuildingafrica.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Green Building Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cities@greenbuildingafrica.co.za", "name": "Cities", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "green_building_africa@greenbuildingafrica.co.za", "name": "Green Building Africa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rand Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-revenue_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-revenue water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_DWS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC DWS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Water_and_Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Department of Water and Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_Undoing_Tax_Abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pumping station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water supply network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microbiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices_and_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices and Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.greenbuildingafrica.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Julius-Kleynhans-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791409", "eventUri": "eng-9791409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It would be a priority for us to correct this misunderstanding, and to encourage communities and leaders to hold their municipalities accountable.\"\n\nShe said she was aware of ongoing protests in the Ennerdale community over water shortages, despite recent maintenance work by Rand Water.\n\n\"To date, the reservoir is not filled to capacity. That reservoir is shared between Ekurhuleni as well as Johannesburg.

Employees were then allegedly instructed to bring their own buckets to collect water for flushing toilets and to continue working their normal hours.\n\nWard 15 Democratic Alliance (DA) Councillor, Prudence Hlanyane, criticised the local government's response, saying that municipalities are obligated to ensure basic water and sanitation services.\n\nShe expressed disappointment over the hopeless measures taken, particularly when local residents are also struggling with water access.\n\nALSO READ | Horror: Girl (7) found dead under bed\n\nHlanyane highlighted the lack of support for residents, who are forced to buy water for their daily needs. Despite her appeals to both Emfuleni and Sedibeng municipalities to address these water issues, she feels ignored, possibly due to her political affiliation.\n\nSpokesman for Emfuleni Local Municipality, Makhosonke Sangweni, acknowledged the water challenges in Vereeniging.\n\nHe noted that the issues had been escalated to Metsi-a-Lekoa and were receiving urgent attention.\n\nAccording to Sangweni, investigations by water technicians revealed that low pressure, worsened by a leaking main water supply pipeline, was the root cause.\n\nAlthough repairs were made to the pipeline, water pressure remains poor.

A special bench of the IHC comprising Chief Justice of IHC Jus\u00adtice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mian\u00adgul Hassan Aurangzeb conduct\u00aded hearing in the appeals moved against their convictions in the case.\n\nOnset of the hearing, Justice Aam\u00ader asked the FIA prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah to define what is a cipher? He also asked that was this cipher a secret document or every cipher is a secret document?\n\nShah replied that every coded doc\u00adument is a secret document by law. The FIA prosecutor submitted a book related to cipher guidelines be\u00adfore court. The IHC CJ asked that is this booklet also a confidential docu\u00adment? The prosecutor said that this book is for official use only and it is classified. He added that this book has been issued on the name of the Deputy Attorney General so that it remains here until the judgment of the court is written.\n\nJustice Aamer remarked that they do not know specifically that what the cipher is. Shah said that the codes can be broken if the cipher of text is known. He further said that there are three forms of cipher, coded, clear and the third is liter\u00adal and literal means what is actual\u00adly said is told. He maintained that not only the cipher but its text also has to be preserved. Justice Mian\u00adgul Hassan asked that did someone intercept the cipher? The FIA pros\u00adecutor said that the coded cipher was not intercepted at any level. The judge further asked that where is it written that a document com\u00ading from a diplomatic mission will be deemed a cipher?\n\nThe IHC bench inquired from the prosecutor to tell the court that how the cipher is an accountable document? Justice Aamer asked that whether these cipher guide\u00adlines are instructions from Cabi\u00adnet Division to Ministries or is it a law? He further said that was the cipher guidelines booklet pro\u00adduced before the trial court? Shah replied that arguments were given but a copy was not produced be\u00adfore the court.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb asked another important question that did any wit\u00adnesses say anything about the con\u00adtents of the cipher? The answered that no one specifically said any\u00adthing about it.\n\nJustice Aamer inquired that did the cipher copy also not provid\u00aded to the investigating officer? Jus\u00adtice Aurangzeb said that here you are going to convict a man and there is a procedure to show this document to the court. He asked that whether the prosecution was seeking death sentence from the trial court and the prosecution still did not show the document in the trial court.\n\nJustice Miangul Hassan re\u00admarked that Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi may not have had this booklet of guidelines that if it was lost, what would be the consequences, so the question is, did Azam Khan inform Imran Khan about its contents? He said that it is a criminal case and all benefit of doubt will go to them.\n\nJustice Aamer also stated that of course, it is a criminal case, even the slightest benefit of doubt will go to the accused. Later, the bench de\u00adferred hearing of the case till today.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cipher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Mahmood_Qureshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shah Mahmood Qureshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamer_Farooq", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aamer Farooq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miangul_Hassan_Aurangzeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azam_Khan_(cricketer,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Azam Khan (cricketer, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aurangzeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2024-04-23/slightest-benefit-of-doubt-will-go-to-cipher-case-accused-ihc-cj-1713832632-3810.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503744", "eventUri": "eng-9503744", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

He also submitted a booklet about the security protocol for cipher and apprised the court that the booklet was issued for 'official use only'.\n\nEarlier on Jan 18, only weeks before the Feb 8 general elections, former principal secretary Azam Khan testified before the special court that the cipher never returned to his office.\n\nThe former bureaucurat claimed he had intimated the then prime minister, his military secretary as well as the relevant staff numerous times.\n\nFour days later, former foreign secretary Sohail Mehmood appeared before the trial court, claiming that the copy sent to ex-PM Khan was never returned while Mr Qureshi said he returned the copy to the ministry and the ex-secretary replied in the affirmative.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Khan had claimed that the cipher was still with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he had received only a rephrased version of the diplomatic cable.\n\nHowever, the FIA special prosecutor told the IHC bench on Monday that the original copy of cipher remained in the custody of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the transcript was sent to the designated offices, adding that those copies were destroyed upon return.\n\nThe

A special bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb will oversee the proceedings.\n\nLast week, Barrister Salman Safdar, representing Imran Khan, concluded his arguments, alleging negligence on the part of former-principal secretary Azam Khan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in safeguarding the secret documents. He pointed out discrepancies in following the rules for protecting confidential diplomatic cables, which resulted in the misplacement of the cipher.\n\nSafdar argued that Azam Khan failed to adhere to protocol by not monitoring the movement of the confidential documents and maintaining proper records. He also accused the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of neglecting its duty to conduct an inquiry and inform the Intelligence Bureau (IB) as per established procedures. During the hearing, Safdar emphasized that the responsibility for the cipher's custody lay with Azam Khan, who allegedly did not return the document as required. Responding to queries from the bench, FIA lawyers provided details of the timeline surrounding the receipt and transmission of the cipher, underscoring the seriousness of its disappearance.\n\nJustice Miangul Hassan expressed surprise at the lack of charges against Azam Khan for negligence or deliberate loss. The proceedings shed light on the procedural lapses and raised questions about accountability in handling classified documents within government departments.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azam_Khan_(cricketer,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Azam Khan (cricketer, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cipher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Mahmood_Qureshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shah Mahmood Qureshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamer_Farooq", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aamer Farooq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miangul_Hassan_Aurangzeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Bureau_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence Bureau (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Investigation_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Investigation Agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2024-04-22/cipher-case-ihc-resumes-imran-qureshi-appeals-hearing-today-1713747653-5857.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503744", "eventUri": "eng-9503744", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

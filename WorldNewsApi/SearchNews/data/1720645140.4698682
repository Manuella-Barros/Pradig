And Nick Sidle\u2019s KFOR and Kosovo +25 will also be seen at the Highlands\u2019 most prestigious arts venue later in the year. The launch of the exhibition will take place at the National Museum of Kosovo on Tuesday (June 11) and is expected to be opened by the country\u2019s Prime Minister. SEE ALSO It is centred on a unique special access Heartstone photodocumentary produced in Kosovo in 2000-1 by the Kiltarlity-based photojournalist when he was embedded with several UK regiments who were part of the KFOR intervention. The first London staging of the exhibition took place at the Tower of London in January. Its success led to the invitation to stage the full exhibition at the National Museum of Kosovo in June at the time of the anniversary. The exhibition will be opened by Lord George Robertson, NATO Secretary General at the time of the photodocumentary. Sitakumari, director of Dingwall-based Heartstone, who organised the original access, will be present in-person at the event and speak of the background to the story, how it was gathered and its role at the time and today. Sidle will join online for an event to mark a period of history that impacted on so many lives in the UK and the other eight countries who were part of KFOR. In 1999, KFOR, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force, entered Kosovo following resolution 1244 by the United Nations Security Council. 2024 marks the 25th anniversary of that deployment. The first UN Security Council Resolution connected to Kosovo was passed on 31st March 1998 and the second on the 23rd September 1998. This was followed by a series of resolutions culminating in Resolution 1244 one year later. Sidle was attached to KFOR in the operation\u2019s early stages. He was embedded with several units and produced a unique record of the work of the peacekeepers showing troops from nine different countries including nineteen individual regiments or units from the United Kingdom and the United States, the two largest contributors to KFOR. The photostory captured not just the work of the soldiers, it also highlighted the world of Kosovo at the time from a human angle, to enable audiences beyond the country to empathise and understand a world in which intolerance and hate had been taken to new levels and why there was a need for the peacekeeping intervention to safeguard lives and homes, and help rebuild ordinary life in what were extraordinary circumstances. The KFOR and Kosovo exhibition in 2002 was presented UK-wide, at the Brussels European Parliament and NATO HQ. It was also converted into a format for use by schools and colleges nationwide to generate discussion on the issues raised. Lord Robertson said: \u201cThis exhibition highlights a remarkable period in recent European history. The armed forces who liberated Kosovo and the people they liberated are now remembered in a historic photodocumentary of real human interest. It is an illustrated lesson for our time.\u201d Gen Sir Nicholas Carter said: \u201cThis exhibition is timely given the turbulence of current global events - for it reminds us that it is possible for the International Community to come together to help a country riven by ethnic tensions.\u201d According to Heartstone, 25 years later, \u201cthis story is not over\u201d and is \u201ca documentary of a period of history that must not be forgotten, but it also holds many lessons for our time in a world where many are living with conflict/hostility, circumstances which are impacting on all of us\u201d. KFOR is still active in Kosovo. Sitakumari said: \u201cThe photostory, and the discussion it leads to, takes its audiences, through a visual, non-political, cultural medium, into a world where they can empathise with those of different backgrounds, understand the commonality of human experience, why prejudice/intolerance needs to be addressed at its earliest stages and particularly in times of difficulty, the need for peacekeeping forces and understand more clearly the refugee experience and that of displaced peoples. \u201cHowever, this is a positive story \u2013 it is about human resilience and hope in extraordinary circumstances and the importance of people and nations working co-operatively together to achieve positive outcomes.\u201d This exhibition is being restored and reworked from film originals to be presented in its full form in June 2024 in Kosovo at the time of the anniversary and following that presentation, a further exhibition is being staged at the National Memorial Arboretum\u2019s Commemoration of Kosovo on June 23rd . The development of this new exhibition was marked with a special presentation at the Scottish Parliament on September 19th, 2023 with Minister Angus Robertson in his role as Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, External Affairs and Culture. The exhibition now includes interviews with veterans of several of the regiments, who were in Kosovo at the time of the photodocumentary and featured in the images, who have been tracked down for the purpose of adding their stories, now 25 years later, into the new exhibition. Some of these veterans will be at the event online on June 11th. This exhibition provides a mechanism to keep alive powerful memories and experiences and use them to inspire and inform the next generation. The exhibition will be coming to Eden Court in Inverness in September and moving onto a presentation at the Houses of Parliament in the autumn. Do you want to respond to this article?

Nothing else matters but taking care of him,'\" he said.\n\nTatum says Deuce changed his life for the better\n\nThe pro basketball star said during the same \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger\" interview that he believed Deuce changed his life for the better.\n\n\"He made me grow up faster and mature. Because with all this newfound fame and success and money at 19, that's a lot to handle. But I wouldn't change it for the world.\n\n\"It motivates me.

Defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games, Tatum's son Deuce has been a part of his father's journey since he came into this world. But seeing Deuce and Jayson during the championship celebrations begs the question: Is Jayson Tatum A Single Dad?\n\nJayson Tatum had a son with his high school ex-girlfriend Toriah Lachell back in 2017. Both Tatum and Lachell welcomed Jayson \"Deuce\" Christopher Tatum Jr. when the Celtics star was just in his rookie year with the team.\n\nWitnessing JT celebrate his first NBA championship with his son was a heartwarming sight to see. However, Deuce's mother, Toriah Lachell was nowhere to be seen and has often stayed out of the limelight.\n\nTatum had his son out of wedlock, and both Jayson and Loriah co-parent Deuce, which does make the Boston Celtics star a single dad. Another factor that confirms Tatum being a single father is there is no romantic involvement between him and his son's mother. However, Lachell does help Tatum out from time to time with parenting duties.\n\nJayson Tatum is one of those stars in the NBA that likes to keep his private life private. Not only is there barely any information about Toriah Lachell, Tatum is rumored to be dating British singer, Ella Mai, and yet fans have rarely seen the two out together in public.\n\nA Redditor who is a Boston resident went on to confirm things about Jayson Tatum's private life involving both Toriah Lachell and Ella Mai.\n\n\"Yeah, they're not together but they're active co-parents and she doesn't want to be part of the Tatum/Celtics limelight. Deuce is in 'No Books No Ball' and shes always around those events/games. Mad nice and normal. Tatum also seems pretty private about that stuff b/c he's been dating Ella Mai for years now and you rarely see them out and about either.\"\n\nAmid his final few weeks with Duke, Jayson Tatum's girlfriend informed him about the pregnancy. Tatum, who had planned out his next few years of graduating from Duke and making it into the league was just handed a shocking revelation.\n\nDuring an interview with Graham Bensinger, Jayson Tatum admitted being selfish at first as he was more focused on getting drafted than being a father. He also revealed why he chose to keep his girlfriend's pregnancy a secret from everyone.\n\n\"I didn't want it to impact where I got drafted. I thought if teams knew I was about to have a kid, they were going to think I wasn't focused and that they wouldn't pick me. So, I was terrified, I didn't want anybody to know, which was extremely selfish.\"\n\nTatum credited his mother for helping put his mind at ease when he was freaking out over having a kid at such an early age. But when asked how having Deuce impacted his life, Tatum said, \"He made me grow up faster.\"\n\n\"Seeing him come to all the games and practice, watch me work out. You know, he motivates me to be the best player, the best father, the best role model that I could be.\"\n\nIt is natural for someone who is still in his teens to be stressed and anxious when informed that he is going to be a father. But despite all those feelings, Jayson Tatum has been fulfilling his duties as a dad and a role model for Deuce as he grows up.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_dhariwal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Abhishek Dhariwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Mai", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ella Mai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Childfree", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Childfree", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/5710547f-untitled-design-2024-06-20t132224.375.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662955", "eventUri": "eng-9662955", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

While the five-time All-Star and three-time First-Team All-NBA selection already boasts an incredible resume, he knew he'd continue to be criticized until he won a title.\n\nAnd on Monday night, he finally silenced those critics -- with Deuce serving as his personal hype man.\n\n\"He told me that I was the best in the world,\" Tatum said of his postgame exchange with his son. \"I said, 'You're damn right I am.'\"\n\nAt just 26 years old, Tatum still has a bright future ahead of him.

Tatum has been saying, \"What they gon' say now?\" as well as other things that show he has heard the criticism. All of the all-time great players still find a way to motivate themselves through tactics similar to this and it's what makes them special.\n\nAnybody who is concerned with potential complacency from Tatum following a championship shouldn't have to worry because the Finals MVP and regular season MVP are what's missing from his resume. Although Tatum already has an impressive resume at the age of 26, he is still missing those individual accolades that could vault him into conversations with the greatest players ever.\n\nThis is why I fully expect Tatum to come out with a purpose and an edge next season because the MVP wins are what he needs to fully put an end to any negative commentary surrounding his game. I would expect a different demeanor and tone from Tatum next season, especially in terms of how he talks with the media.\n\nImagine an angry Tatum out to prove his worth next season.

After six long years of hard work and dedication, Tatum's dreams of becoming an NBA champion has finally come true. Leading his team in points, rebounds, and assists, Jayson Tatum was able to lead his franchise to a league record 18th NBA Championship.\n\nRELATED: Boo'd Up With A BUMP: Ella Mai Reportedly Expecting 1st Child With NBA Champ Jayson Tatum\n\nDespite his leading efforts, it was Jaylen Brown who would be crowned as the Bill Russel NBA Finals MVP. However, this did not seem to affect Tatum, as he seemed more concerned with finally being able to hoist the Larry O'Brian trophy in front of his home crowd fans at the TD Garden.\n\n\"WE DID IT!\" Tatum shouted, at a loss for words from the magnitude of the moment.\n\nIf you remember the last time the Celtics won the championship in 2008, you can still hear Kevin Garnett's iconic 'ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE' scream, in which we heard a watered down version of that last night (June 17th).\n\nTatum also questioned the media asking them 'What they gon' say now?' referring the hypothetical narrative of what to do with the Celtics roster after not winning a championship. A topic that sports analysts dissected every year of Brown and Tatum's tenure together... until now. But social media could not help but recollect a time when this phrase was said before, with more conviction.\n\nGoing back to 2022 when Stephen Curry won his 4th championship, he used this same line to question all the media members who thought the Warriors dynasty was over. Angel Reese most recently said the famous quote after her national championship win with LSU.\n\nThe catchphrase confiscation continued after the game during the post game celebration where Tatum told the crowd \"Everybody was wondering what would happen if we didn't win. I guess we'll never know.\". Apparently, this iconic line had alrerady been polarized by Kanye West during his grammy acceptance speech\n\nTatum has also been scrutinized for allegedly trying to recreate the Championship photos of his hero, NBA Legend Kobe Bryant. As we remember Bryant, sitting in the corner of the team shower, holding the trophy with a look of discontent on his face; we then see Pictures of Jayson Tatum surface, in what appears to be the team shower, posing with his head down.\n\nNowhere in the rulebook of life does it say that you can't do these things, however, social media believed that Tatum should have been able to come up with his 'own' moment, iconic or not, instead of 'trying to recreate' other iconic moments that happened in previous years.\n\nRELATED: Joel Embiid Blames Bucks Failing to Keep Jrue Holiday as Celtics Close in on 2024 NBA Championship, Social Media Says Worry About Your Own Team\n\nRELATED: Mike Breen 'BANG BANG' History: Every time ESPN announcer has hit a double 'bang' during NBA Games\n\n'Copy Cat' Celtic?

While he celebrated the win with his teammates, Tatum was heard saying, \"What they gon' say now?\" Well, it seems the newly crowned NBA superstar is loving the post-win treatment. The Celtics star took to X to share his feelings of getting much-deserved respect from the people around him.\n\nIt was a seven-year-long wait for the five-time NBA All-Star to finally get his hands on the Larry O'Brien. Two years ago, he reached very close to his dream but was beaten by the Warriors.\n\nHowever, this time, the Celtics weren't willing to let the opposition get the best of them. As a result of that determination, Tatum seems to have gotten a new moniker. He wrote, \"Everybody at the golf course called me \"champ\" today, I fu*king loved it.\"\n\nEven though he's pumped for being called such names, the 2024 NBA champ is looking forward to the main event of the celebrations in Boston tomorrow. He further wrote, \"Can't wait for the parade tomorrow.\" It's a hard-earned victory for Tatum, his teammates, and the entire organization.\n\nTatum averaged 22.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and one steal, per game, in the five-game series. Even though he struggled with his shooting percentage, he did his job well enough to ensure the first ring for his franchise since 2008.\n\nWhen a player shows such dominance in the field, it's important that they do their victory lap. And that's exactly what Tatum has been doing since he became the champ.\n\nThe Celtics have earned every right to paint the town green and the entire squad is aware of it. It seems like Tatum didn't only take charge of leading his team to glory, but he is also in charge of celebrating the win. Immediately after they clinched their fourth win in the series at home, Tatum yelled at the top of his lungs,\n\n\"Oh, my god. It's a surreal feeling. We did it. WE DID IT!!\"\n\nThe Celtics forward has been hyped ever since. In fact, immediately after winning his first ring, he had something else to look forward to. Tatum's childhood friend Matthew Tkachuk, who plays for the Florida Panthers in the NHL, is on the verge of winning the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn a social media clip, he said, \"Tkachuk! Yo, get it done tomorrow. One kid from St. Louis won a championship today. Let's make it two tomorrow.\" The Panthers are leading the Finals 3-2 and might be able to close the series tonight against the Oilers.

So everything in your life becomes more meaningful. And one of the last things I want to be able to see is for the Celtics to hang up banner No. 18.\"\n\nThe Celtics granted Cousy's wish, defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games to snap their 16-year championship drought.\n\nJaylen Brown earned NBA Finals MVP honors while Jayson Tatum finished the series with a brilliant 31-point, 11-assist performance. The Celtics' star duo finally got over the hump after several deep postseason runs that ended in disappointment, and with the team built for sustained success, this could be just the beginning of a dynastic run.\n\nCousy joined Chris Forsberg on a brand new episode of the Celtics Talk Podcast and heaped praise on the Jays' evolution as players.\n\n\"Tatum brings it to the basket and finishes as well as anybody 6-7 I've seen, and he's got an excellent shooting touch,\" Cousy said. \"If we want to look for negatives, I would say occasionally I'm not a fan of the 3-point shot as the first option. I'm absolutely in favor of using it as a weapon, because it's an effective one and the Celtics do it probably as well as any team in the league, and Tatum as well as any 6-7. That little stepback he has, when it's on, it's great. But I'm saying just don't use it as your first option.\"\n\n\"He touches every offensive base to be successful, and I think he does it as well as anyone, certainly his size. ... Tatum, I don't think has any weaknesses.\"\n\nCousy raved about Brown's all-around improvement.\n\n\"I think this year, in my judgment, Jaylen has made giant strides in every part of the game,\" he said. \"Defensively, his passing, he's turning it over less. ... He's hit some key shots. Remember that game in the playoffs (Game 3 against Indiana)? Absolutely key, and that was under pressure.\n\n\"So, he doesn't quite have the weapons that Tatum has, but boy, he's not far behind. And to have those two both as young players -- 26, 27 -- for the next few years is good news for the Celtics. They could extend this championship run for a few years.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Cousy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Cousy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Shaughnessy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Shaughnessy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/47adb1afa372ee6a2dd6c0110aa95048", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662955", "eventUri": "eng-9662955", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

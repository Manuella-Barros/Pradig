{"id": 237326140, "title": "Likely \u2018a bird strike\u2019: Virgin Australia flight makes emergency landing in New Zealand after engine fire", "text": "A suspected bird strike has caused a Virgin Australia plane to make an emergency landing in New Zealand after one of its engines caught fire shortly after takeoff. The Melbourne-bound flight left Queenstown on Monday evening with footage emerging later that appeared to show fire coming from the Boeing 737-800. Flight tracking websites show that immediately after taking off the plane headed south from Queenstown \u2013 rather than west to Melbourne as was scheduled. It performed a holding pattern while flying over the South Island before landing at the airport in Invercargill, about 150km south of Queenstown. The Boeing 737-800 jet was carrying 67 passengers and six crew. It landed safely about 50 minutes after leaving Queenstown and was met by fire trucks on the tarmac. \u201cAt this time, we are not aware of any physical injuries to guests or crew,\u201d Virgin Australia\u2019s chief operations officer, Stuart Aggs, said. Passengers said they saw flames coming from one of the engines and heard loud bangs, the New Zealand Herald reported. Michael Hayward said it was completely dark outside when the plane took off at 6pm local time. \u201cWithin 10 seconds of going airborne, you hear just the loudest \u2018bang\u2019, golden lights filling within the cabin and a burst of flames off the right-hand engine,\u201d he told ABC radio. Hayward said he was quite anxious as were the other passengers \u2013 with a few cries in the cabin as people realised something had gone wrong. \u201cI could see flames shooting out of [the engine] at regular intervals,\u201d he said, adding the captain later informed passengers the plane had hit a flock of birds. \u201cThere was an initial worry but it wasn\u2019t long until people realised OK, it\u2019s under control, so just sit back, relax and whatever happens happens.\u201d Queenstown airport\u2019s chief executive, Glen Sowry, said on Tuesday that a bird caught in the engine was the most likely cause of the incident. \u201cAt this stage, we believe that it\u2019s highly probable that it was a bird strike, but until such time as the engine has been inspected by engineers in Invercargill we won\u2019t be able to confirm that for sure,\u201d Sowry told RNZ. Bird strikes were a known risk but incidents were infrequent, the CEO said. The airport took regular risk-management measures, including keeping the grass short and not allowing standing water nearby. \u201cIf you get a bigger bird that is ingested into an engine, which looks probably what may have occurred on this occasion, then \u2013 depending on where in the engine it goes \u2013 it can damage critical parts.\u201d The runway had been inspected two minutes before the plane took off and no bird activity had been recorded, Sowry said. Aircraft are designed to be able to operate and land using one engine. The Virgin Australia flight most likely took a pre-determined safe route, designed for instances of engine failure, to avoid nearby mountains, Sowry said on Tuesday. Queenstown airport released a statement confirming the flight \u201cexperienced an issue just after takeoff\u201d and was diverted to Invercargill. Passengers were given accommodation in Invercargill overnight and were then transported back to Queenstown airport where they were expected to be booked on alternative flights to Australia on Tuesday. The rate of birds striking planes at New Zealand\u2019s airports is about four in every 10,000 aircraft movements, the country\u2019s aviation regulator says on its website. \u2013 Additional reporting Australian Associated Press", "summary": "<p>Boeing 737-800 plane travelling from Queenstown to Melbourne diverts due to bird probably being \u2018ingested into an engine\u2019</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jun/18/australia-news-live-li-qiang-anthony-albanese-china-rba-interest-rates-peter-dutton-emissions-reduction-nuclear\">Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates</a></strong></li><li><strong>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></strong></li></ul><p>A suspected bird strike has caused a Virgin Australia plane to make an emergency landing in New Zealand after one of its engines caught fire shortly after takeoff.</p><p>The Melbourne-bound flight left Queenstown on Monday evening with footage emerging later that appeared to show fire coming from the Boeing 737-", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/18/likely-a-bird-strike-virgin-australia-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-new-zealand-after-engine-fire", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75719d30f3045f9a32492572c9d5c359e96ecb16/654_309_611_367/master/611.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:25:22", "author": "Elias Visontay,Stephanie Convery", "authors": ["Elias Visontay", "Stephanie Convery"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.264}

Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements.

While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Company's filings with the SEC are, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

In addition, adjusted EBITDA adjusts for recurring charges of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives on the Company's ongoing business and financial performance and are helpful to provide investors with an understanding of our core operating results reflecting our normal business operations. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the Company's reported and forecasted GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics.\n\nInvestor Contact:\n\nChris Chaney Vice President, Investor Relations IR@adeia.com\n\n(1) Represents separation and related costs that were incurred subsequent to the separation on October 1, 2022, including fees for financial advisory and other professional services, and expenses incurred on a transitional basis under a contract shared with Xperi (NASDAQ:ADEA) Inc.\n\n(2) The provision for income taxes is adjusted to reflect the net direct and indirect income tax effects of the various non-GAAP pretax adjustments.\n\nADEIA INC.

All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and are not guarantees of future results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to implement its business strategy; the Company's ability to enter into new and renewal license agreements with customers on favorable terms; the Company's ability to retain and hire key personnel; uncertainty as to the long-term value of the Company's common stock; legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company's business; general economic and market developments and conditions; the Company's ability to grow and expand its patent portfolios; changes in technology and development of new technology in the industries in which in which the Company operates; the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; unforeseen liabilities and expenses; risks associated with the Company's indebtedness; the Company's ability to achieve the intended benefits of, and its ability to recognize the anticipated tax treatment of, the spin-off of its product business; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, natural disasters and future outbreaks or pandemics, each of which may have an adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.

While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Company's filings with the SEC are, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

In addition, adjusted EBITDA adjusts for recurring charges of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives on the Company's ongoing business and financial performance and are helpful to provide investors with an understanding of our core operating results reflecting our normal business operations. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the Company's reported and forecasted GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics.\n\nRepresents separation and related costs that were incurred subsequent to the separation on October 1, 2022, including fees for financial advisory and

I want to thank the EverQuote team for the incredible tenacity they have demonstrated and continue to demonstrate through the recent hard market cycle and our customers for their continued partnership.\"\n\n\"In the first quarter, we achieved record levels of net income, Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow, as we started to realize the benefits of actions taken in 2023 to realign the business,\" said Joseph Sanborn, CFO of EverQuote. \"We achieved our previously articulated goal of restoring consistent positive quarterly cash flow from operations and have returned to our pre-downturn Adjusted EBITDA margins. Looking ahead, as we gain increasing confidence in the auto insurance industry recovery, we will continue to invest responsibly in our platform and business to position the company for growth and success.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n\n(Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are relative to the first quarter of 2023. EverQuote exited the health insurance vertical at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Revenue in our health insurance vertical was $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2023.)\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Outlook:\n\nWith respect to the Company's expectations under \"Second Quarter 2024 Outlook\" above, the Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP measure net income (loss) in this press release because the Company does not provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, interest income, and income taxes on a consistent basis as the Company is unable to quantify these amounts without unreasonable efforts, which would be required to include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss). In addition, the Company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nEverQuote will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its first quarter 2024 financial results at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, May 6, 2024. To access the conference call, dial Toll Free: +1 (800) 715-9871 for the US, or +1 (646) 307-196 for international callers, and provide conference ID 4210704.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"might,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"seek,\" \"would\" or \"continue,\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") from time to time. Additional information will also be set forth in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, which will be filed with the SEC. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ include: (1) our dependence on revenue from the property and casualty insurance industries, and specifically automotive insurance, and exposure to risks related to those industries; (2) our dependence on our relationships with insurance providers with no long-term minimum financial commitments; (3) our reliance on a small number of insurance providers for a significant portion of our revenue; (4) our dependence on third-party media sources for a significant portion of visitors to our websites and marketplace; (5) our ability to attract consumers searching for insurance to our websites and marketplace through Internet search engines, display advertising, social media, content-based online advertising and other online sources; (6) any limitations restricting our ability to market to users or collect and use data derived from user activities; (7) risks related to cybersecurity incidents or other network disruptions; (8) risks related to the use of artificial intelligence; (9) our ability to develop new and enhanced products and services to attract and retain consumers and insurance providers, and to successfully monetize them; (10) the impact of competition in our industry and innovation by our competitors; (11) our ability to hire and retain necessary qualified employees to expand our operations; (12) our ability to stay abreast of and comply with new or modified laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business, including with respect to the insurance industry, telemarketing restrictions and data privacy requirements; (13) our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and maintain and build our brand; (14) our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, variable marketing margin, operating expenses, cash flows and ability to achieve, and maintain, future profitability; (15) our ability to properly collect, process, store, share, disclose and use consumer information and other data; and (16) the future trading prices of our Class A common stock.\n\nAbout EverQuote\n\nEverQuote operates a leading online insurance marketplace, connecting consumers with insurance providers. Our vision is to become the largest online source of insurance policies by using data, technology, and knowledgeable advisors to make insurance simpler, more affordable and personalized.\n\nFor more information, visit everquote.com and follow on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/everquote/.\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding EverQuote's financial results, the Company has presented Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization expense; restructuring and other charges; acquisition-related costs; interest income; and income taxes. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The Company monitors and presents Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing EverQuote's business. In particular, the Company believes that excluding the impact of these items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of EverQuote's core operating performance.\n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate EverQuote's operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in EverQuote's business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that the Company excludes in the calculations of Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, the Company believes that this financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating EverQuote's operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects.\n\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, which could reduce the usefulness of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuote", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EverQuote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542262", "eventUri": "eng-9542262", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies over the next 24 months and how that will affect the Company's business and its ability to identify and close new opportunities with new investees are material factors that the Company considered when setting its strategic priorities and objectives, and its outlook for its business.\n\nKey assumptions include, but are not limited to: assumptions that the Canadian and U.S. economies relevant to the Company's investment focus will remain relatively stable over the next 12 to 24 months; that interest rates will not increase dramatically over the next 12 to 24 months; that the Company's existing investees will continue to make royalty payments to the Company as and when required; that the businesses of the Company's investees will not experience material negative results; that the Company will be able to successfully integrate and grow the businesses of its predecessor companies; that the Company will continue to grow its portfolio in a manner similar to what has already been established; that tax rates and tax laws will not change significantly in Canada and the U.S.; that more small to medium private and public companies will continue to require access to alternative sources of capital; that the Company will have the ability to raise required equity and/or debt financing on acceptable terms; and that the Company will have sufficient free cash flow to pay dividends. The Company has also assumed that access to the capital markets will remain relatively stable, that the capital markets will perform with normal levels of volatility and that the Canadian dollar will not have a high amount of volatility relative to the U.S. dollar.

Generally, such forward-looking information or forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or may contain statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"will continue\", \"will occur\" or \"will be achieved\". The forward-looking information contained herein may include, but is not limited to, information relating to the current or prospective performance of one or more of the Company's investments and the book value per common share of the Company.\n\nAn investment in securities of the Company is speculative and subject to a number of risks including, without limitation, risks relating to: the need for additional financing; the relative speculative and illiquid nature of an investment in the Company; the volatility of the Company's share price; the Company's ability to generate sufficient revenues; the Company's ability to manage future growth; the limited diversification in the Company's existing investments; the Company's ability to negotiate additional royalty purchases from new investee companies; the Company's dependence on the operations, assets and financial health of its investee companies; the Company's limited ability to exercise control or direction over investee companies; potential defaults by investee companies and the unsecured nature of the Company's investments; the Company's ability to enforce on any default by an investee company; competition with other investment entities; tax matters, including the potential impact of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act on the Company; the potential impact of the Company being classified as a Passive Foreign Investment Company; the Company's ability to pay dividends in the future and the timing and amount of those dividends; reliance on key personnel, particularly the Company's founders; dilution of shareholders' interest through future financings; and general economic and political conditions; as well as the risks discussed in the Company's public filings. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information and forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.\n\nIn connection with the forward-looking information and forward-looking statements contained in this press release, the Company has made certain assumptions. Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies over the next 24 months and how that will affect the Company's business and its ability to identify and close new opportunities with new investees are material factors that the Company considered when setting its strategic priorities and objectives, and its outlook for its business.\n\nKey assumptions include, but are not limited to: assumptions that the Canadian and U.S. economies relevant to the Company's investment focus will remain relatively stable over the next 12 to 24 months; that interest rates will not increase dramatically over the next 12 to 24 months; that the Company's existing investees will continue to make royalty payments to the Company as and when required; that the businesses of the Company's investees will not experience material negative results; that the Company will be able to successfully integrate and grow the businesses of its predecessor companies; that the Company will continue to grow its portfolio in a manner similar to what has already been established; that tax rates and tax laws will not change significantly in Canada and the U.S.; that more small to medium private and public companies will continue to require access to alternative sources of capital; that the Company will have the ability to raise required equity and/or debt financing on acceptable terms; and that the Company will have sufficient free cash flow to pay dividends. The Company has also assumed that access to the capital markets will remain relatively stable, that the capital markets will perform with normal levels of volatility and that the Canadian dollar will not have a high amount of volatility relative to the U.S. dollar.

Commences Trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange", "body": "This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nZefiro is an environmental services company, specializing in methane abatement. Zefiro strives to be a key commercial force towards Active Sustainability. Leveraging decades of operational expertise, Zefiro is building a new toolkit to clean up air, land, and water sources directly impacted by methane leaks. The Company has built a fully integrated ground operation driven by an innovative monetization solution for the emerging methane abatement marketplace. As an originator of high-quality U.S.-based methane offsets, Zefiro aims to generate long-term economic, environmental, and social returns.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company,\n\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking information is often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"seeks\", \"believes\", \"plans\", \"expects\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"anticipates\" and statements that an event or result \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\" or \"might\" occur or be achieved and other similar expressions. In particular, this news release contains forward-looking information including statements regarding: the Company's intention to reduce emissions from end-of-life oil and gas wells and eliminate methane gas; the Company's partnerships with industry operators, state agencies, and federal governments; the Company's expectations for continued increases in revenues and EBITDA growth as a result of these partnerships; the Company's intentions to build out its presence in the United States; the anticipated federal funding for orphaned well site plugging, remediation and restoring activities; the Company's expectations to become a growing environmental services company; the Company's ability to provide institutional and retail investors alike with the opportunity to join the Active Sustainability movement; the Company's ability to generate long-term economic, environmental, and social returns; and other statements regarding the Company's business and the industry in which the Company operates. The forward-looking information reflects management's current expectations based on information currently available and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking information. Although the Company believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing the forward-looking information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information and no assurance can be given that such events will occur in the disclosed timeframes or at all. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (i) adverse general market and economic conditions; (ii) changes to and price and volume volatility in the carbon market; (iii) changes to the regulatory landscape and global policies applicable to the Company's business; (iv) failure to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals; and (v) other risk factors set forth in the Prospectus under the heading \"Risk Factors\". The Company operates in a rapidly evolving environment where technologies are in the early stage of adoption. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is impossible for the Company's management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on Company's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking information. Forward-looking information in this news release is based on the opinions and assumptions of management considered reasonable as of the date hereof, including, but not limited to, the assumption that general business and economic conditions will not change in a materially adverse manner.

Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only management's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Company's control. It is possible that our actual results, financial condition and liquidity may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results, financial condition and liquidity in these forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results may differ from its expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"budget,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which are current only as of the date of this release. Results for any specified quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any future period. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the Company or other matters and attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. A number of important factors exist that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by operating as a modern retirement solutions platform rather than a vertically-integrated, diversified lending and complementary services platform due to the transformation of our business; our ability to successfully operate the recently integrated lending platform that we acquired from American Advisors Group in March 2023 and generally, our ability to operate our business profitably; our ability to respond to significant changes in prevailing interest rates and to resume profitable business operations; our geographic market concentration if the economic conditions in our current markets should decline or if our current markets are impacted by natural disasters; our use of estimates in measuring or determining the fair value of the majority of our financial assets and liabilities, which may require us to write down the value of these assets or write up the value of these liabilities if the estimates prove to be incorrect; our ability to prevent cyber intrusions and mitigate cyber risks; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors in our business markets and worldwide financial markets, including a sustained period of higher interest rates; our ability to manage changes in our licensing status, business relationships or servicing guidelines with the Government National Mortgage Association, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or other governmental entities; our ability to obtain sufficient capital and liquidity to meet the financing and operational requirements of our business and our ability to comply with our debt agreements, including warehouse lending facilities, and pay down our substantial debt; our ability to refinance our debt on reasonable terms as it becomes due; our ability to manage disruptions in the secondary home loan market, including the mortgage-backed securities market; our ability to finance and recover costs of our reverse mortgage servicing operations; our ability to maintain compliance with the extensive regulations we are subject to, including consumer protection laws applicable to reverse mortgage lenders, which may be highly complex; our ability to compete with national banks, which are not subject to state licensing and operational requirements; our ability to manage various legal proceedings, federal or state governmental examinations and enforcement investigations we are subject to from time to time, the results of which are difficult to predict or estimate; our continued ability to remain in compliance with the terms of the consent orders issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of operational assets from American Advisors Group; our holding company status and dependency on distributions from Finance of America Equity Capital LLC; our ability to comply with the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") and avoid the delisting of our common stock from trading on its exchange; our common stock trading history has been characterized by low trading volume, which may result in an inability to sell your shares at a desired price, if at all; and our \"controlled company\" status under NYSE rules, which exempts us from certain corporate governance requirements and affords stockholders fewer protections.\n\nAll of these factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements, or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Please refer to \"Risk Factors\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 15, 2024, for further information on these and other risk factors affecting us, as such factors may be amended and updated from time to time in the Company's subsequent periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe Company's management evaluates performance of the Company through the use of certain measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), including Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Loss per Share.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Loss as net income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related obligations due to assumption changes, deferred purchase price obligations (including earnouts and Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\") obligations), contingent earnout, warrant liability, and minority investments, amortization and impairment of intangibles and other assets, equity-based compensation, certain non-recurring costs, and pro-forma income tax provision adjustments to apply an effective combined corporate tax rate to adjusted consolidated pre-tax loss from continuing operations.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss (defined above) adjusted for taxes, interest on non-funding debt, and depreciation.\n\nWe define Adjusted Loss Per Share as Adjusted Net Loss (defined above) divided by our weighted average outstanding shares, which includes our outstanding Class A Common Stock plus Finance of America Equity Capital LLC's Class A LLC units owned by our noncontrolling interests on an if-converted basis.\n\nThe presentation of non-GAAP measures is used to enhance investors' understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. This discussion is not meant to be considered in isolation, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes these key financial measures provide an additional view of our performance over the long-term and provide useful information that we use in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating cash flows, or any other performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Loss per Share have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are: (i) cash expenditures for future contractual commitments; (ii) cash requirements for working capital needs; (iii) cash requirements for certain tax payments; and (iv) all non-cash income/expense items.\n\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Loss per Share should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or distribute to shareholders. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement.

Demand for engineering services remains strong and we generated healthy new orders during the quarter, especially in transportation which showed a meaningful increase as a percentage of total backlog. With the bulk of our organic growth anticipated to occur during the balance of 2024, we are confident we have sufficient revenue in backlog and a right-sized organizational infrastructure to deliver expanding margins as we realize the increasing benefits of scale throughout the year. We are pleased to increase our net service billing and adjusted EBITDA guidance once again for 2024.\"\n\n\"In early April we closed on an equity offering that included approximately $51 million of gross proceeds to the company,\" continued Bowman. \"Then, last week we closed on a new $100 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America and TD Bank and separately on an $11 million cash-out refinancing of recently acquired Surdex aviation assets. As a result of these efforts, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized to continue to grow and execute on our current high-frequency acquisition strategy.\"\n\nFinancial Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to March 31, 2023:\n\nIn connection with the release of financial results the Company reported the non-GAAP financial metric of adjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted EPS\") as follows:\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to March 31, 2023:\n\nTo calculate Adjusted EPS, the Company adds back non-reoccurring expenses specific to acquisitions, non-cash stock compensation expense associated with pre-IPO grants, and other expenses not in the ordinary course of business. With respect to the elimination of any non-cash stock compensation expense, the Company computes an adjusted tax expense or benefit which accounts for the elimination of any periodic windfall or shortfall tax effects resulting from the difference between grant date fair value and vest date value. With respect to all other eliminations, the Company applies its average marginal statutory tax rate, currently 25.6%, to derive the tax adjustment associated with the elimination of these expenses. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS, both basic and diluted, is included with this press release for reference.\n\nUpdating FY 2024 Guidance\n\nThe Company is adjusting its full year 2024 outlook for net service billing to be in the range of $382 to $397 million and Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $63 to $69 million. The current outlook for 2024 is based on completed acquisitions as of the date of this release and does not include contributions from any future acquisitions. Management discusses the Company's acquisition pipeline and its prospective impact during regularly scheduled earnings calls.\n\nQ1 2024 Earnings Webcast\n\nBowman will host an earnings webcast to discuss the results of the quarter as follows:\n\nAbout Bowman Consulting Group Ltd.\n\nHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, Bowman is a national engineering services firm delivering infrastructure solutions to customers who own, develop, and maintain the built environment.

(OTCQB: BLMH) (the \"Company,\" \"Bl\u00fcm,\" \"we\" or \"us\"), a cannabis company which through its subsidiaries has operations throughout California, remains optimistic about the Drug Enforcement Administration's (\"DEA\") decision to reschedule marijuana as a lower-risk substance. This groundbreaking move is anticipated to reform the cannabis industry by alleviating longstanding financial and operational burdens.\n\n\"Cannabis has a long and storied history in the collective social, economic, moral, and political conscious of the United States. We at Bl\u00fcm understand the flawed history of cannabis's classification as a Schedule I controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Agency and the legal, financial, and political consequences of such a classification,\" said Robert Baca, Chief Legal Officer of Bl\u00fcm.\n\n\"The Department of Justice's proposal to reschedule cannabis as a Schedule III controlled substance is significant for the cannabis industry, its operators, and ultimately its consumers. While the breadth of impact and the implications resulting from such a reclassification will be fully realized over time, we acknowledge its significance and are prepared for its impacts. The cannabis industry is no stranger to rapid change and Bl\u00fcm is confident in its ability to continue to adapt to an evolving regulatory landscape. Bl\u00fcm supports administrative and legislative efforts that champion the industry and look forward to keeping our heads down and working hard no matter the exigencies or transformations in the market,\" Baca added.\n\nAbout Bl\u00fcm Holdings\n\nBl\u00fcm Holdings is a leader in the cannabis sector. Our commitment to quality, innovation, and customer service makes us a trusted name in the cannabis industry, dedicated to shaping its future.

People love the muscle health benefits Rejuvenate's patented formula produces and we're making it easier to quench that thirst.\"\n\nRejuvenate Muscle Activator\u2122 is being relaunched with two new flavors - Citrus and Raspberry - each in 30-count and 14-count drink stick SKUs. The new flavors were developed with a leading US-based flavor house celebrated for its track record for creating some of the most popular flavors in the nutritional supplement category.\n\nAbout Promino\u2122 and Rejuvenate Muscle\u2122\n\nPromino\u2122 is NSF Certified for Sport, which means it is free of banned substances and approved for use by all major sports leagues. Additionally, Promino invested in a rigorous flavoring process with a top tier U.S. flavor house responsible for creating the taste of several of North America's best-selling sports nutrition beverages. Followed by extensive in-market consumer testing, the Company will launch two refreshing fruit flavors in Q2 2024.\n\nPromino\u2122 and Rejuvenate\u2122 utilize a patented formula from the University of Arkansas , led by Dr. Robert Wolfe and is the result of over USD $20 million in research over 23 years including extensive human clinical trials on muscle repair, recovery and muscle protein synthesis.\n\nThe patented essential amino acid blend, in the precise ratio to accelerate muscle protein synthesis, is fast-absorbing and provides the body with the building blocks of protein faster, without the excess calories, filler and carbohydrates of conventional whey or plant proteins. Promino\u2122's patented amino acid formula contains the essential building blocks of protein and are shown to be the highest quality protein source in the world based on the rising gold standard of protein quality - DIAAS - which measures the uptake of these key amino acids in the digestive tract. With a 321 DIAAS (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score), Promino\u2122 is superior to whey protein at 109.\n\nPromino\u2122 is more effective than whey protein at producing the desired results - with none of the fat, sugar, carbs or bloat. It is a significant step forward for pro and collegiate athletes.\n\nAbout Promino\n\nPromino is an innovative and research driven Canadian nutraceutical company specializing in the development of patented and science-based products for the global consumer packaged goods market, with a portfolio focused specifically on muscle health. Promino's lead product, Rejuvenate\u2122, is a patented proprietary formulation that is clinically proven to assist in the building, rebuilding, restoration and rejuvenation of natural muscle mass.

Generally, such forward-looking information or forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or may contain statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"will continue\", \"will occur\" or \"will be achieved\". The forward-looking information contained herein may include, but is not limited to, information relating to the current or prospective performance of one or more of the Company's investments and the book value per common share of the Company.\n\nAn investment in securities of the Company is speculative and subject to a number of risks including, without limitation, risks relating to: the need for additional financing; the relative speculative and illiquid nature of an investment in the Company; the volatility of the Company's share price; the Company's ability to generate sufficient revenues; the Company's ability to manage future growth; the limited diversification in the Company's existing investments; the Company's ability to negotiate additional royalty purchases from new investee companies; the Company's dependence on the operations, assets and financial health of its investee companies; the Company's limited ability to exercise control or direction over investee companies; potential defaults by investee companies and the unsecured nature of the Company's investments; the Company's ability to enforce on any default by an investee company; competition with other investment entities; tax matters, including the potential impact of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act on the Company; the potential impact of the Company being classified as a Passive Foreign Investment Company; the Company's ability to pay dividends in the future and the timing and amount of those dividends; reliance on key personnel, particularly the Company's founders; dilution of shareholders' interest through future financings; and general economic and political conditions; as well as the risks discussed in the Company's public filings. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information and forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.\n\nIn connection with the forward-looking information and forward-looking statements contained in this press release, the Company has made certain assumptions. Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies over the next 24 months and how that will affect the Company's business and its ability to identify and close new opportunities with new investees are material factors that the Company considered when setting its strategic priorities and objectives, and its outlook for its business.\n\nKey assumptions include, but are not limited to: assumptions that the Canadian and U.S. economies relevant to the Company's investment focus will remain relatively stable over the next 12 to 24 months; that interest rates will not increase dramatically over the next 12 to 24 months; that the Company's existing investees will continue to make royalty payments to the Company as and when required; that the businesses of the Company's investees will not experience material negative results; that the Company will be able to successfully integrate and grow the businesses of its predecessor companies; that the Company will continue to grow its portfolio in a manner similar to what has already been established; that tax rates and tax laws will not change significantly in Canada and the U.S.; that more small to medium private and public companies will continue to require access to alternative sources of capital; that the Company will have the ability to raise required equity and/or debt financing on acceptable terms; and that the Company will have sufficient free cash flow to pay dividends. The Company has also assumed that access to the capital markets will remain relatively stable, that the capital markets will perform with normal levels of volatility and that the Canadian dollar will not have a high amount of volatility relative to the U.S. dollar. In determining expectations for economic growth, the Company primarily considers historical economic data provided by the Canadian and U.S. governments and their agencies. Although the Company believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing, and the expectations contained in, the forward-looking information and statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information and statements, and no assurance or guarantee can be given that such forward-looking information and statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information and statements.\n\nThe forward-looking information and forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date of this press release. All subsequent written and oral forward- looking information and statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf is expressly qualified in its entirety by this notice.\n\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Growth capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Securities_Litigation_Reform_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private Securities Litigation Reform Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlobeNewswire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GlobeNewswire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Book value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSX_Venture_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSX Venture Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Default (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royalty payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Valuation_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Valuation Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ae213140-df8c-11e7-b06d-b798580d75a5.jpg?resize=600%2C333", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542262", "eventUri": "eng-9542262", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-05-", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Certain statements contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus, the information incorporated herein by reference, and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us or on our behalf are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition, and liquidity, may not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. As such, they are considered \"forward-looking statements\" which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"can,\" \"should,\" \"possible,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"potential,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"may impact,\" \"on track,\" and similar words or expressions. These forward-looking statements should be considered with the understanding that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially.\n\nForward-looking statements in this document or in the information incorporated herein by reference may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, industry unit shipments, productivity and raw material prices. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) the impact of macroeconomic conditions; (2) business disruptions; (3) consumers' and other stakeholders' perceptions of our brands; (4) the ability to implement restructurings as planned, whether the expected amount of costs associated with restructurings will differ from forecasts, whether the Company will be able to realize the anticipated benefits from restructurings in the amounts and times expected; (5) the ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from business acquisitions in the amounts and at the times expected; (6) the impact of competitive conditions; (7) the ability to realize the intended benefits of the separation of WK Kellogg Co (the \"separation\"); (8) the possibility of disruption from the separation, including changes to existing business relationships, disputes, litigation or unanticipated costs; (9) uncertainty of the expected financial performance of the Company following completion of the separation; (10) the effectiveness of pricing, advertising, and promotional programs; (11) the success of innovation, renovation and new product introductions; (12) the success of our Better Days and sustainability programs; (13) the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles; (14) the success of productivity improvements and business transitions; (15) commodity and energy prices, transportation costs, labor costs, disruptions or inefficiencies in supply chain; (16) the availability of and interest rates on short-term and long-term financing; (17) actual market performance of benefit plan trust investments; (18) the levels of spending on systems initiatives, properties, business opportunities; (19) integration of acquired businesses; (20) other general and administrative costs; (21) changes in consumer behavior and preferences; (22) the effect of U.S. and foreign economic conditions on items such as interest rates; (23) statutory tax rates; (24) currency conversion and availability; (25) legal and regulatory factors including changes in food safety, advertising and labeling laws and regulations, the ultimate impact of product recalls; (26) business disruption or other losses from war, terrorist acts or political unrest; and (27) the risks and uncertainties described herein under \"Risk Factors.\"\n\nExcept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, and investors are advised to review disclosures in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. Therefore, investors should not consider the foregoing factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or factors that could potentially cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements.

The Company's focus is the acquisition and development of lithium projects in South America.\n\nThe Company opportunistically advances battery metal projects where it has a peer advantage in project selection and initial evaluation. Lithium market dynamics and a rapidly increasing metal price are the result of profound structural issues with the industry meeting anticipated future demand. Wealth is positioning itself to be a major beneficiary of this future mismatch of supply and demand. In parallel with lithium market dynamics, Wealth believes other battery metals will benefit from similar industry trends.\n\nFor further details on the Company readers are referred to the Company's website (www.wealthminerals.com) and its Canadian regulatory filings on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this press release, which has been prepared by management.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian and US securities legislation. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein including, without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated content, commencement, timing and cost of exploration programs, anticipated exploration program results, the discovery and delineation of mineral deposits/resources/reserves, the Company's expectation that it will be able to enter into agreements to acquire interests in additional mineral projects, and the anticipated business plans and timing of future activities of the Company, are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as: believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, postulate and similar expressions, or are those, which, by their nature, refer to future events. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements by the Company are not guarantees of future results or performance, and that actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the state of the financial markets for the Company's equity securities, the state of the commodity markets generally, variations in the nature, quality and quantity of any mineral deposits that may be located, variations in the market price of any mineral products the Company may produce or plan to produce, the inability of the Company to obtain any necessary permits, consents or authorizations required, including TSXV acceptance, for its planned activities, the inability of the Company to produce minerals from its properties successfully or profitably, to continue its projected growth, to raise the necessary capital or to be fully able to implement its business strategies, and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in the Company's latest interim Management Discussion and Analysis and filed with certain securities commissions in Canada.

Lithium market dynamics and a rapidly increasing metal price are the result of profound structural issues with the industry meeting anticipated future demand. Wealth is positioning itself to be a major beneficiary of this future mismatch of supply and demand. In parallel with lithium market dynamics, Wealth believes other battery metals will benefit from similar industry trends.\n\nFor further details on the Company readers are referred to the Company's website (www.wealthminerals.com) and its Canadian regulatory filings on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors of\n\nWEALTH MINERALS LTD.\n\n\"Hendrik van Alphen\"\n\nHendrik van Alphen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nMarla Ritchie, Michael Pound or Henk van Alphen\n\nPhone: 604-331-0096 or 604-638-3886\n\nFor all Investor Relations inquiries, please contact:\n\nJohn Liviakis\n\nLiviakis Financial Communications Inc.\n\nPhone: 415-389-4670\n\nor\n\nLucas A.

The Company's focus is the acquisition and development of lithium projects in South America.\n\nThe Company opportunistically advances battery metal projects where it has a peer advantage in project selection and initial evaluation. Lithium market dynamics and a rapidly increasing metal price are the result of profound structural issues with the industry meeting anticipated future demand. Wealth is positioning itself to be a major beneficiary of this future mismatch of supply and demand. In parallel with lithium market dynamics, Wealth believes other battery metals will benefit from similar industry trends.\n\nFor further details on the Company readers are referred to the Company's website (www.wealthminerals.com) and its Canadian regulatory filings on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors of\n\nWEALTH MINERALS LTD.\n\n\"Hendrik van Alphen\"\n\nHendrik van Alphen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nMarla Ritchie, Michael Pound or Henk van Alphen\n\nPhone: 604-331-0096 or 604-638-3886\n\nFor all Investor Relations inquiries, please contact:\n\nJohn Liviakis\n\nLiviakis Financial Communications Inc.\n\nPhone: 415-389-4670\n\nor\n\nLucas A.

The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. Any statements made in this press release or during the earnings call that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, and full year 2024 guidance, the Zeta 2025 plan, the financial targets of Zeta 2025 and the timing of when we will achieve the Zeta 2025 plan, our strong competitive position, visibility of new customers, expansion of existing customers, the capabilities of AI and Zeta's platform, the acceleration of the digital transformation and our business, and the growth and expansion of AI and the Zeta Marketing Platform are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our anticipated future financial performance, our market opportunities and our expectations regarding our business plan and strategies. These statements often include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"suggests,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"estimates,\" \"targets,\" \"projects,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" \"guidance\" and other similar expressions. We base these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances at such time. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or results.\n\nThe forward-looking statements are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: global supply chain disruptions; macroeconomic and industry trends and adverse developments in the debt, consumer credit and financial services markets and other macroeconomic factors beyond Zeta's control; increases in our borrowing costs as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors; the impact of inflation on us and on our customers; potential fluctuations in our operating results, which could make our future operating results difficult to predict; underlying circumstances, including cash flows, cash position, financial performance, market conditions and potential acquisitions; prevailing stock prices, general economic and market condition; the impact of future pandemics, epidemics and other health crises on the global economy, our customers, employees and business; the war in Ukraine and escalating geopolitical tensions as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine; the escalating conflict in Israel, Gaza and in the surrounding areas; our ability to innovate and make the right investment decisions in our product offerings and platform; the impact of new generative AI capabilities and the proliferation of AI on our business; our ability to attract and retain customers, including our scaled and super-scaled customers; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to collect and use data online; the standards that private entities and inbox service providers adopt in the future to regulate the use and delivery of email may interfere with the effectiveness of our platform and our ability to conduct business; a significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we process, or a security breach of our or our customers', suppliers' or other partners' computer systems; and any disruption to our third-party data centers, systems and technologies. These cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and the forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\n\nThe second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, and full year 2024 guidance provided herein are based on Zeta's current estimates and assumptions and are not a guarantee of future performance. The guidance provided is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors discussed in the Company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), that could cause actual results to differ materially. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the results expressed by this guidance or the targets.\n\nAvailability of Information on Zeta's Website and Social Media Profiles\n\nInvestors and others should note that Zeta routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Zeta investor relations website at https://investors.zetaglobal.com (\"Investors Website\"). We also intend to use the social media profiles listed below as a means of disclosing information about us to our customers, investors and the public. While not all of the information that the Company posts to the Investors Website or to social media profiles is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material.

We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our performance by providing an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial performance over multiple periods.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow provide us with useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as well as comparison to our peers. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in analyzing our financial and operational performance. Nevertheless our use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider our non-GAAP measures only as supplemental to other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including revenues and net loss.\n\nWe calculate forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in forward-looking GAAP net income (loss). We do not attempt to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow guidance to forward looking GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) margin or GAAP cash flows from operating activities, respectively, because forecasting the timing or amount of items that have not yet occurred and are out of our control is inherently uncertain and unavailable without unreasonable efforts.

(Nasdaq: CMPO), a leader in metal payment cards, security, and authentication solutions, today announced its operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\"We are off to a strong start in 2024 as we generated a record quarter of revenue, driven by continued momentum in our domestic business,\" said Jon Wilk, President and CEO of CompoSecure. \"We were excited to see several high-profile customer programs that garnered significant attention in the marketplace including a new, limited edition version of a payment card made from a recycled airplane and the Robinhood Gold Card.

For more information, please visit www.CompoSecure.com and www.GetArculus.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management. Although CompoSecure believes that its plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, CompoSecure cannot assure you that it will achieve or realize these plans, intentions, or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning CompoSecure's possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. In some instances, these statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"seeks,\" \"plans,\" \"scheduled,\" \"anticipates\" or \"intends\" or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of the date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, among others, could affect CompoSecure's future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in CompoSecure's forward-looking statements: the timing and amount of the special cash dividend; the ability of CompoSecure to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within its industry and retain its key employees; the possibility that CompoSecure may be adversely impacted by other global economic, business, competitive and/or other factors; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against CompoSecure or others; future exchange and interest rates; and other risks and uncertainties, including those under \"Risk Factors\" in filings that have been made or will be made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CompoSecure undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. CompoSecure believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are useful to investors in evaluating CompoSecure's financial performance. CompoSecure uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, as well as evaluate its underlying historical performance and/or to measure incentive compensation, as we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures depict the true performance of the business by encompassing only relevant and controllable events, enabling CompoSecure to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Due to the forward-looking nature of the financial guidance included above, specific quantification of the charges excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures included in such financial guidance, including with respect to depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes, that would be required to reconcile the non GAAP financial measures included in such financial guidance to GAAP measures are not available, so it is not feasible to provide accurate forecasted non-GAAP reconciliations without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included, and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included. In addition, CompoSecure's debt agreements contain covenants that use a variation of these measures for purposes of determining debt covenant compliance. CompoSecure believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are significant components in understanding and assessing CompoSecure's financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of CompoSecure's liquidity and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

We are off to a good start, yet recognize that it is still early in the year and uncertainty remains. Based on our performance to date and our outlook for the balance of the year, we believe results will likely trend towards the higher-end of our previously announced guidance ranges.\n\nWe also took important steps in our portfolio optimization strategy by reaching an agreement to sell our Pharma Solutions business and completing the previously announced divestiture of our Cosmetic Ingredients business. These actions, along with the rightsizing of our dividend earlier this year, represent significant steps toward our commitment to strengthen our capital structure and improve our debt leverage ratio.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Consolidated Financial Results\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Segment Summary: Growth vs. Prior Year\n\nThe Company now expects full year 2024 results to trend towards the higher-end of its previously announced sales guidance range of $10.8 billion to $11.1 billion and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. The Company expects volume to trend towards the higher-end of its previously announced 0% to 3% range, with improvements across the majority of the portfolio. Pricing is now expected to increase approximately 1% versus a decline of approximately 2.5%, principally driven by the impact of foreign exchange rate changes in emerging markets where the Company has index pricing to US and/or EURO exchange rates.\n\nBased on current market foreign exchange rates, the Company expects that foreign exchange will have a 3% to 4% (versus 0 to 1% previously) adverse impact to sales growth.\n\nThe Company cannot reconcile its expected adjusted operating EBITDA without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include but are not limited to acquisition, divestiture and integration related costs, gains (losses) on business disposals and regulatory costs.\n\nAudio Webcast\n\nA live webcast to discuss the Company's first quarter 2024 financial results will be held on May 7, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. ET.

Such forward-looking statements are based on management's current assumptions, estimates and expectations including those concerning expected cash flow and availability of capital resources to fund our operations and meet our debt service requirements; our ability to execute on our strategic and financial transformation, including the progress and success of our portfolio optimization strategy (including the sale process for our Pharma Solutions business), through non-core business divestitures and acquisitions, and expectations regarding the implementation of our refreshed growth-focused strategy and expectations around our business divestitures; our ability to continue to generate value for, and return cash to, our shareholders; expectations of the impact of inflationary pressures and the pricing actions to offset exposure to such impacts; the impact of high input costs, including commodities, raw materials, transportation and energy; the expected impact of global supply chain challenges; our ability to enhance our innovation efforts, drive cost efficiencies and execute on specific consumer trends and demands; the growth potential of the markets in which we operate, including the emerging markets; expectations regarding sales and profit for the fiscal year 2024, including the impact of foreign exchange, pricing actions, raw materials, energy, and sourcing, logistics and manufacturing costs; the impact of global economic uncertainty and recessionary pressures on demand for consumer products; the success of our integration efforts, following the N&B Transaction, and ability to deliver on our synergy commitments as well as future opportunities for the combined company; our strategic investments in capacity and increasing inventory to drive improved profitability; our ability to drive cost discipline measures and the ability to recover margin to pre-inflation levels; expected capital expenditures in 2024; and the expected costs and benefits of our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing operations, including the expected number of closings.\n\nThese forward-looking statements should be evaluated with consideration given to the many risks and uncertainties inherent in our business that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Certain of such forward-looking information may be identified by such terms as \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"intend\", \"outlook\", \"may\", \"estimate\", \"should\", \"predict\" and similar terms or variations thereof. Such forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company, are not guarantees of future results or performance, and involve significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, including assumptions and projections, for all forward periods. Our actual results may differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, the following: (1) our substantial amount of indebtedness and its impact on our liquidity, credit ratings and ability to return capital to its shareholders; (2) our ability to successfully execute the next phase of our strategic transformation; (3) our ability to declare and pay dividends which is subject to certain considerations; (4) the impact of the outcomes of legal claims, disputes, regulatory investigations and litigation; (5) inflationary trends, including in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy; (6) supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war and wider Middle East developments (including disruptions to the Red Sea passage) or climate-change related events (including severe weather events) that may affect our suppliers or procurement of raw materials; (7) our ability to attract and retain key employees, and manage turnover of top executives; (8) our ability to successfully market to our expanded and diverse customer base; (8) our ability to effectively compete in our market and develop and introduce new products that meet customers' needs; (9) changes in demand from large multi-national customers due to increased competition and our ability to maintain \"core list\" status with customers; (10) our ability to successfully develop innovative and cost-effective products that allow customers to achieve their own profitability expectations; (11) disruption in the development, manufacture, distribution or sale of our products from international conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war), geopolitical events, trade wars, natural disasters (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), public health crises, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political or economic crises (such as the uncertainty related to U.S. government funding negotiations), accidents and similar events; (12) the impact of a significant data breach or other disruption in our information technology systems, and our ability to comply with data protection laws in the U.S. and abroad; (13) our ability to benefit from our investments and expansion in emerging markets; (14) the impact of currency fluctuations or devaluations in the principal foreign markets in which we operate; (15) economic, regulatory and political risks associated with our international operations; (16) the impact of global economic uncertainty (including increased inflation) on demand for consumer products; (17) our ability to integrate the N&B Business and realize anticipated synergies, among other benefits; (18) our ability to react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands, including increased awareness of health and wellness; (19) our ability to meet increasing customer, consumer, shareholder and regulatory focus on sustainability; (20) our ability to successfully manage our working capital and inventory balances; (21) any impairment on our tangible or intangible long-lived assets; (22) our ability to enter into or close strategic transactions or divestments, or successfully establish and manage acquisitions, collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships; (23) changes in market conditions or governmental regulations relating to our pension and postretirement obligations; (24) the impact of the phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") on our variable rate interest expense; (25) our ability to comply with, and the costs associated with compliance with, regulatory requirements and industry standards, including regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environment impact; (26) defects, quality issues (including product recalls), inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products and capabilities; (27) our ability to comply with, and the costs associated with compliance with, U.S. and foreign environmental protection laws; (28) the impact of our or our counterparties' failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, similar U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, applicable sanctions laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or ethical business practices and related laws and regulations; (29) our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; (30) the impact of changes in federal, state, local and international tax legislation or policies and adverse results of tax audits, assessments, or disputes; (31) the impact of any tax liability resulting from the N&B Transaction; and (32) our ability to comply with data protection laws in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors, nor necessarily present them in order of importance. In addition, you should consult other disclosures made by the Company (such as in our other filings with the SEC or in company press releases) for other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the Company. Please refer to Part I. Item 1A., Risk Factors, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 for additional information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe intend our forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of such statements and do not undertake or plan to update or revise them as more information becomes available or to reflect changes in expectations, assumptions or results. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this press release or included in our other periodic reports filed with the SEC could materially and adversely impact our operations and our future financial results. Any public statements or disclosures made by us following this press release that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in or accompanying this press release will be deemed to modify or supersede such outlook or other forward-looking statements in or accompanying this press release.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe provide in this press release non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) comparable currency neutral sales; (ii) adjusted operating EBITDA and comparable adjusted operating EBITDA; (iii) adjusted operating EBITDA margin; (iv) adjusted EPS ex amortization; (v) free cash flow; and (vi) net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are defined below.\n\nCurrency Neutral metrics eliminate the effects that result from translating non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars. We calculate currency neutral numbers by translating current year invoiced sale amounts at the exchange rates used for the corresponding prior year period. We use currency neutral results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use currency neutral numbers when analyzing our performance against our competitors.\n\nAdjusted operating EBITDA and adjusted operating EBITDA margin exclude depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other expense, net, and certain non-recurring or unusual items that are not part of recurring operations such as, restructuring and other charges, acquisition, divestiture and integration related costs, entity realignment costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs and other items.\n\nAdjusted EPS ex Amortization excludes the impact of non-operational items including, restructuring and other charges, acquisition, divestiture and integration related costs, losses (gains) on business disposals, entity realignment costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs and other items that are not a part of recurring operations.\n\nFree Cash Flow is operating cash flow (i.e. cash flow from operations) less capital expenditures.\n\nNet debt to credit adjusted EBITDA is the leverage ratio used in our credit agreements and defined as net debt (which is debt for borrowed money less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA. Credit adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, specified items and non-cash items.\n\nComparable results for the first quarter exclude the impact of divestitures and acquisitions.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' calculation of such metrics.\n\nThe Company cannot reconcile its expected adjusted operating EBITDA under \"Financial Guidance\" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include but are not limited to acquisition, divestiture and integration related costs, gains (losses) on business disposals, and regulatory costs.\n\nWelcome to IFF\n\nAt IFF (NYSE: IFF), an industry leader in food, beverage, scent, health and biosciences, science and creativity meet to create essential solutions for a better world - from global icons to unexpected innovations and experiences.

(Nasdaq: IMUX), a biotechnology company developing a clinical pipeline of orally administered, small molecule therapies for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, today announced participation in the following investor and scientific conferences in May:\n\nAbout Immunic, Inc.\n\nImmunic, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMUX) is a biotechnology company developing a clinical pipeline of orally administered, small molecule therapies for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The company's lead development program, vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838), is currently in phase 3 and phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis, respectively, and has shown therapeutic activity in phase 2 clinical trials in patients suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, progressive multiple sclerosis and moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Vidofludimus calcium combines neuroprotective effects, through its mechanism as a first-in-class nuclear receptor related 1 (Nurr1) activator, with additional anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects, by selectively inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). IMU-856, which targets the protein Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), is intended to restore intestinal barrier function and regenerate bowel epithelium, which could potentially be applicable in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, such as celiac disease, for which it is currently in preparations for a phase 2 clinical trial. IMU-381, which currently is in preclinical testing, is a next generation molecule being developed to specifically address the needs of gastrointestinal diseases.

The Company has reserved all of its rights against the aforementioned individuals and intends to take such steps or initiate such proceedings as may be available and appropriate to recover from the terminated individuals the losses it alleges the Company has suffered, and may continue to suffer, and recover the gains the Company alleges they may have benefited from, due to the serious misconduct found by the Special Committee. The Special Committee's findings are currently not expected to materially change or impact the Company's prior financial statements and associated reportings.\n\nThe Board has appointed Mr. Christopher S. Wallace as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company with immediate effect. As a current member of the Company's Board appointed as part of the reconstitution undertaken last year, chair of the Company's Audit Committee, and with a wealth of experience in leadership and finance, including in the critical minerals industry through other public corporate directorships, Mr. Wallace brings a renewed perspective and discipline of oversight during this transition period. During the transition, the Board will ensure the Company has the management expertise and skills needed to execute on its strategic vision and plans; and will exit the transition with a Board that is properly constituted with the requisite skills and experience to lead the Company accordingly. Mr. Brett Richards, also a current member of the Board and an experienced and accomplished natural resources executive and corporate director with over 37 years of experience in senior and operational management, project development and business development roles in the mining and metals industry, has agreed to provide certain transition consultancy services to the Company in the coming months to support the Company's ongoing business and operations until the vacant leadership roles have been filled. Mr. Martin Vydra, EVP, Strategy, and Mr. Craig Lennon, Head of Asia Pacific, remain with the Company and will continue their roles helping to manage Nickel 28's business and operations.\n\nThe Company's core strategic vision and objectives remain unchanged. The Board and continuing leadership team remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and accountability in all aspects of Nickel 28's operations. Full details of the impact of the terminations of Messrs. Milewski, Cochrane and Kearns will be disclosed, as and when required, in the Company's future continuous disclosure filings, including its 2025 management information circular.\n\nAbout Nickel 28\n\nNickel 28 Capital Corp. is a nickel-cobalt producer through its 8.56% joint-venture interest in the producing, long-life and world-class Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Operation located in Papua New Guinea. Ramu provides Nickel 28 with significant attributable nickel and cobalt production thereby offering our shareholders direct exposure to two metals which are critical to the adoption of electric vehicles.

On the flip side, operationally, we continue to press forward with our business, which is doing fantastic, and we hope to continue to garner widespread recognition for our products, stated Praveenkumar Vijayakumar, CEO of LeapCharger.

Our operations are based in the UAE and we aim to expand operations into other regions such as North America, EU and South Asia in the near future. Our charging stations will be strategically placed in high-traffic areas, ensuring that EV owners have easy access to our services. We offer a user-friendly mobile app that allows customers to easily locate our charging stations, reserve charging spots, and pay for their charging sessions. We have also integrated advertising solutions in our charging stations to generate additional income. In addition to our commercial offerings, we will also partner with residential communities and property owners to install charging stations in their buildings. Additionally, we understand that our customers prioritize efficiency and convenience, so we are installing 150kW+ charging stations at highway exits and petrol pumps. These stations offer a higher charging speed, allowing drivers to get back on the road quickly. One of the ways we achieve this is by offering lower charging rates than our competitors, thanks to our innovative use of advertising revenue. Our charging stations are equipped with 55-inch screens, which serve to provide our clients with a valuable marketing channel and also serve as marketing channels for our LeapCharger brand.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended) concerning the Company, expected listing and trading, the Companys technology and future anticipated growth.

(\"Standard Uranium\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V: STND) (OTCQB: STTDF) (Frankfurt: FWB:9SU) announces that effective at the opening of markets on or about May 8, 2024, the Company will complete its previously announced consolidation (the \"Consolidation\") of its outstanding common share capital on the basis of one (1) post-Consolidation common share for every five (5) pre-Consolidation common shares. The post-Consolidation common shares of the Company will continue to trade under the existing ticker symbol \"STND\" and the new CUSIP: 85422Q848.\n\nThe Consolidation is being undertaken to increase flexibility and competitiveness in the market, and to make the Company's securities more attractive to a wider audience of potential investors.\n\nAs a result of the Consolidation, the Company's currently outstanding 230,649,292 common shares will be reduced to approximately 46,129,859 common shares. No fractional common shares will be issued as a result of the Consolidation. Instead, any fractional common shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of common shares.\n\nA letter of transmittal will be mailed to registered shareholders as of the date of this news release. The letter of transmittal contains instructions on how registered shareholders can exchange their share certificates evidencing their pre-Consolidation common shares for new share certificates representing the number of post-Consolidation common shares to which they are entitled.\n\nBeneficial shareholders holding their common shares through a brokerage may be subject to different procedures for obtaining their post-Consolidation common shares. If shareholders have any questions in this regard, they are encouraged to contact their respective brokerage or intermediary.\n\nAbout Standard Uranium (TSX-V: STND)\n\nWe find the fuel to power a clean energy future\n\nStandard Uranium is a uranium exploration company and emerging project generator poised for discovery in the world's richest uranium district. The Company holds interest in over 209,867 acres (84,930 hectares) in the world-class Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. Since its establishment, Standard Uranium has focused on the identification, acquisition, and exploration of Athabasca-style uranium targets with a view to discovery and future development.\n\nStandard Uranium has successfully completed four joint venture earn in partnerships on their Sun Dog, Canary, Atlantic and Ascent projects totaling over $31M in work commitments over the next three years from 2024-2027.\n\nStandard Uranium's Davidson River Project, in the southwest part of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, comprises ten mineral claims over 30,737 hectares. Davidson River is highly prospective for basement-hosted uranium deposits due to its location along trend from recent high-grade uranium discoveries. However, owing to the large project size with multiple targets, it remains broadly under-tested by drilling. Recent intersections of wide, structurally deformed and strongly altered shear zones provide significant confidence in the exploration model and future success is expected.\n\nStandard Uranium's eight eastern Athabasca projects comprise thirty mineral claims over 32,838 hectares. The eastern basin projects are highly prospective for unconformity related and/or basement hosted uranium deposits based on historical uranium occurrences, recently identified geophysical anomalies, and location along trend from several high-grade uranium discoveries.\n\nStandard Uranium's Sun Dog project, in the northwest part of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, is comprised of nine mineral claims over 19,603 hectares. The Sun Dog project is highly prospective for basement and unconformity hosted uranium deposits yet remains largely untested by sufficient drilling despite its location proximal to uranium discoveries in the area.\n\nFor further information contact:\n\nJon Bey, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman\n\nSuite 918, 1030 West Georgia Street\n\nVancouver, British Columbia, V6E 2Y3\n\nTel: 1 (306) 850-6699\n\nE-mail: This email address is being protected from spambots.

(NYSE American: COHN), a financial services firm specializing in an expanding range of capital markets and asset management services, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nLester Brafman, Chief Executive Officer of Cohen & Company, said, \"We are very pleased to report our second consecutive quarter of strong earnings. 2024 is off to a great start with adjusted pre-tax income of $7.7 million and earnings per share of $1.28 in the first quarter. Over the last six months, we have generated over $23 million of adjusted pre-tax income and $4.25 of earnings per share.\n\n\"Despite the on-going challenging market environment, we continue to invest in our full-service boutique investment banking operation, Cohen & Company Capital Markets (\"CCM\"), which has grown to 23 professionals. During the past two years, we repositioned the business with a focus on CCM and we are beginning to see our robust pipeline deliver through the P&L. We are particularly proud of the fact that CCM has become a leading advisor for De-SPAC transactions.\n\n\"Our net trading operations are also off to a strong start. In the first quarter, net trading revenue increased 26% from the prior quarter. In January, we announced the hiring of George Holstead as the head of our new Middle Markets Group, and we have since hired four traders and two salespeople into that group. Although we continue to experience unfavorable volatility in negative mark-to-market adjustments on our principal investing portfolio, we are well positioned for continued growth.\n\n\"We are excited about the momentum we have built as we look to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity to grow our topline revenue and profitability. We will continue to invest prudently in revenue generating talent and additional diversification of our offerings. Moving forward, we remain focused on enhancing stockholder value, including through continued payment of our quarterly dividend.\"\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nTotal Equity and Dividend Declaration\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), today, May 6, 2024, to discuss these results.

Please see the discussion under \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below. Also see the tables below for the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures of performance to their corresponding GAAP measures of performance.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis communication contains certain statements, estimates, and forecasts with respect to future performance and events. These statements, estimates, and forecasts are \"forward-looking statements.\" In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"seek,\" or \"continue\" or the negatives thereof or variations thereon or similar terminology. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this communication are forward-looking statements and are based on various underlying assumptions and expectations and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\" in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), which are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.cohenandcompany.com/investor-relations/sec-filings. Such risk factors include the following: (a) a decline in general economic conditions or the global financial markets, including those caused by inflation, raising interest rates, and the current geopolitical situation, (b) losses caused by financial or other problems experienced by third parties, (c) losses due to unidentified or unanticipated risks, (d) a lack of liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds for use in our businesses, (e) the ability to attract and retain personnel, (f) litigation and regulatory issues, (g) competitive pressure, (h) an inability to generate incremental income from new or expanded businesses, (i) unanticipated market closures or effects due to inclement weather or other disasters, (j) losses (whether realized or unrealized) on our principal investments, (k) the possibility that payments to the Company of subordinated management fees from its CDOs will continue to be deferred or will be discontinued, (l) the possibility that the Company's stockholder rights plan may fail to preserve the value of the Company's deferred tax assets, whether as a result of the acquisition by a person of 5% of the Company's common stock or otherwise, (m) the Company's reduction in the volume of its investments into SPACs, (n) the difficulty in identifying potential business combinations as a result of increased competition in the SPAC market, (o) the value of our holdings of founders shares in post-business combination companies is volatile and may decline and the possibility that significant portions of the founder shares may remain restricted for a long period of time, (p) the possibility that the Company will stop paying quarterly dividends to its stockholders, (q) the possibility that the Company will incur additional losses liquidating collateral related to a reverse repo with now bankrupt First Guaranty Mortgage Corporation, and (r) the impacts of rising interest rates and inflation. As a result, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this communication will prove to be accurate or correct. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future performance or events described in the forward-looking statements in this communication might not occur. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Quarterly Financial Results\n\nDue to the nature of our business, our revenue and operating results may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, revenue and net income in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. Further, our employee compensation arrangements are in large part incentive-based and, therefore, will fluctuate with revenue. The amount of compensation expense recognized in any one quarter may not be indicative of such expense in future periods. As a result, we suggest that annual results may be the most meaningful gauge for investors in evaluating our business performance.\n\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss) and adjusted pre-tax income (loss) per diluted share\n\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss) is not a financial measure recognized by GAAP. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) represents net income (loss) attributable to Cohen & Company Inc., computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding income tax expense (benefit), plus the net income (loss) attributable to the convertible non-controlling interest. Income tax expense (benefit) has been excluded because a pre-tax measurement of enterprise earnings that includes net income (loss) attributable to the convertible non-controlling interest is a useful and appropriate measure of performance. Furthermore, our income tax expense (benefit) has been, and we expect it will continue to be, a substantially non-cash item for the foreseeable future, generated from adjustments in our valuation allowance applied to the Company's gross deferred tax assets. Convertible non-controlling interest is added back to adjusted pre-tax income because the underlying Cohen & Company, LLC equity units are convertible into Cohen & Company Inc. shares. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) per diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pre-tax income (loss) by diluted shares outstanding, both of which include adjustments used in the corresponding calculation in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe present adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts in this release because we consider them to be useful and appropriate supplemental measures of our performance. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts help us to evaluate our performance without the effects of certain GAAP calculations that may not have a direct cash or recurring impact on our current operating performance. In addition, our management uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts to evaluate the performance of our enterprise operations.

(CSE:TTX) - (FSE:DW8) - (OTCQB:TTLXF) (\"Tantalex\" or the \"Corporation\"), is pleased to announce a first tranche closing of a non-brokered private placement for gross proceeds of USD$250,000 (the \"Private Placement\").\n\nThe Corporation has issued 9,765,714 common shares (the \"Common Shares\") at a price of $0.035 per Common Share of the Corporation. The Common Shares were issued based on an exchange rate of USD$1.00 = CDN$1.372. The Corporation did not pay any finder's fees on a portion of the Private Placement.\n\nMr. Simon Collins, a director of the Corporation, acquired 9,765,714 Common Shares for total consideration of CDN$341,800. The participation of Mr. Collins, an insider of the Corporation, constitutes a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation has determined that Mr. Collins' participation in the Private Placement will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 in reliance on the exemptions set forth in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), respectively, of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market value of the Common Shares purchased nor the consideration paid by him exceeds 25% of the Corporation's market capitalization. The Corporation did not file a material change report more than 21 days before the expected closing of the Private Placement as the participation by Mr. Collins was not settled until shortly prior to closing and the Corporation wished to close on an expedited basis for sound business reasons. The Private Placement was previously approved by the disinterested directors of the Corporation. No special committee was established in connection with the transaction, and no materially contrary view was expressed or made by any director.\n\nThe proceeds of the Private Placement will be used for project expenditures related to the optimization of the TiTan tin and tantalum plant and for general working capital. All securities issued pursuant to the Private Placement will be subject to a four-month-and-one day statutory hold period in accordance with applicable securities law.\n\nThe securities being referred to in this news release have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States (U.S.) Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\n\nAbout Tantalex Lithium Resources Corporation\n\nTantalex Lithium is an exploration and development stage mining company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and distribution of lithium, tin, tantalum and other high-tech mineral properties in Africa.\n\nIt is currently focused on developing its lithium assets in the prolific Manono area in the Democratic Republic of Congo; The Manono Lithium Tailings Project and the Pegmatite Corridor Exploration Program.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\n\nThis news release includes certain statements that may be deemed forward looking statements.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as \"guidance,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" \"shall,\" and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In particular, the following factors, among others, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements: our ability to successfully execute our business and growth strategy; the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs; the demand for our platforms, product offerings, and services in general; our ability to increase our number of new customers and revenue generated from customers; our ability to realize some or all of the total contract value of customer contracts as revenue, including any contractual options available to customers or contractual periods that are subject to termination for convenience provisions; our long and unpredictable sales cycle; our ability to successfully execute our channel sales and other strategic initiatives with third parties; our ability to retain and expand our customer base; the fluctuation of our results of operations and our key business measures on a quarterly basis in future periods; the seasonality of our business; the implementation process for our platforms, which may be complex and lengthy; our ability to successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers; our ability to make our platforms and product offerings easier to install, consume, and use; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation; our ability to maintain and enhance our culture as our business grows and as we pursue our business and financial goals; news or social media coverage about us, including but not limited to coverage that presents, or relies on, inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information; the impact of recent or future global macroeconomic and geopolitical events, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel conflicts, heightened interest rates, monetary policy changes, or foreign currency fluctuations, on the business and operations of our company or of our existing or prospective customers and partners; issues raised by the use of artificial intelligence on our platforms; and any breach or access to our or customer or third-party data.\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\nAdditional Definitions\n\nFor the purpose of this press release, our earnings webcast, and our CEO's letter:\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables, as well as our earnings webcast and our CEO's letter, contain the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; adjusted operating margin; adjusted free cash flow; adjusted free cash flow margin; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\"); adjusted EBITDA margin; adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders; and adjusted EPS, diluted.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics described in this press release help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir's business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. We exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of Palantir's control.\n\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, adjusted free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for a given period. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\nA reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release is included at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future, such as stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nPalantir uses its Investor Relations website at https://investors.palantir.com as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

Words such as \"guidance,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" \"shall,\" and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In particular, the following factors, among others, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements: our ability to successfully execute our business and growth strategy; the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs; the demand for our platforms, product offerings, and services in general; our ability to increase our number of new customers and revenue generated from customers; our ability to realize some or all of the total contract value of customer contracts as revenue, including any contractual options available to customers or contractual periods that are subject to termination for convenience provisions; our long and unpredictable sales cycle; our ability to successfully execute our channel sales and other strategic initiatives with third parties; our ability to retain and expand our customer base; the fluctuation of our results of operations and our key business measures on a quarterly basis in future periods; the seasonality of our business; the implementation process for our platforms, which may be complex and lengthy; our ability to successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers; our ability to make our platforms and product offerings easier to install, consume, and use; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation; our ability to maintain and enhance our culture as our business grows and as we pursue our business and financial goals; news or social media coverage about us, including but not limited to coverage that presents, or relies on, inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information; the impact of recent or future global macroeconomic and geopolitical events, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel conflicts, heightened interest rates, monetary policy changes, or foreign currency fluctuations, on the business and operations of our company or of our existing or prospective customers and partners; issues raised by the use of artificial intelligence on our platforms; and any breach or access to our or customer or third-party data.\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\nAdditional Definitions\n\nFor the purpose of this press release, our earnings webcast, and our CEO's letter:\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables, as well as our earnings webcast and our CEO's letter, contain the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; adjusted operating margin; adjusted free cash flow; adjusted free cash flow margin; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\"); adjusted EBITDA margin; adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders; and adjusted EPS, diluted.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics described in this press release help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir's business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. We exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of Palantir's control.\n\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, adjusted free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for a given period. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\nA reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release is included at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future, such as stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nPalantir uses its Investor Relations website at https://investors.palantir.com as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

These statements include but are not limited to, statements regarding our future performance and our market opportunity, including expected financial results for the second quarter and full year, our business strategy, our plans, and our objectives and future operations.\n\nForward-looking statements are based upon various estimates and assumptions, as well as information known to us as of the date hereof, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially due to a variety of factors, including: our ability to effectively compete in the fitness and nutrition industries; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new operations; our reliance on a few key products; market conditions and global and economic factors beyond our control; intense competition and competitive pressures from other companies worldwide in the industries in which we operate; and litigation and the ability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. You can identify these statements by the use of terminology such as \"believe\", \"plans\", \"expect\", \"will\", \"should,\" \"could\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\" or similar forward-looking terms. You should not rely on these forward-looking statements as they involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements, as well as risks relating to our business in general, we refer you to the \"Risk Factors\" section of our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, including those risks and uncertainties included in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024 and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at https://investors.thebeachbodycompany.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\n\nAll forward-looking statements contained herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this press release or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.\n\nThe Beachbody Company, Inc.\n\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nThe Beachbody Company, Inc.\n\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP performance measure, to supplement our results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance, as it is similar to measures reported by our public competitors and is regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\n\nWe define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs, amortization of content assets, interest expense, income taxes, equity-based compensation, and other items that are not normal, recurring, operating expenses necessary to operate the Company's business as described in the reconciliation below.\n\nWe include this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by management to evaluate BODi's core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because they are non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and equity-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of restructuring costs, interest income and expense).\n\nThe table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA reconciled to our net loss, the closest GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\nRepresents the loss related to the $1.0 million and $5.5 million partial debt prepayments that the Company made on January 9, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe non-cash charge for employee incentives which were expected to be settled in equity was recorded and included in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we reclassified the non-cash charge from employee incentives expected to be settled in equity to equity-based compensation because we settled certain employee incentives with RSU awards during the period.\n\nIncludes restructuring expense and personnel costs associated with the Company's key initiatives during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and with executing our key growth priorities during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nPrimarily includes interest income.\n\nWe use net cash position, which is a non-GAAP liquidity measure, to supplement our liquidity as presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that net cash position is useful in viewing our liquidity, as it is similar to measures reported by our public competitors and is regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing liquidity. Net cash position is not intended to be a substitute for GAAP financial measures and, as calculated may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of liquidity for other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\n\nThe table below presents our net cash position, which is our cash and cash equivalents less the debt on our balance sheet for the periods indicated:\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe use free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP liquidity measure, to supplement our cash provided by (used in) operating activities as presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that free cash flow is useful in evaluating our liquidity, as it is similar to measures reported by our public competitors and is regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing liquidity. Free cash flow is not intended to be a substitute for GAAP financial measures and, as calculated may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of liquidity for other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\n\nThe table below presents our free cash flow, which is our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property and equipment for the periods indicated:", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Beachbody Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safe harbor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Act_of_1933", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Securities Act of 1933"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategic management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542262", "eventUri": "eng-9542262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-05-", "textStart": 1389, "textEnd": 1395}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-03-", "textStart": 4486, "textEnd": 4494}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 452725267, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 117, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 117}}}

The increase was primarily due to higher sales of Dream Sock products, reflecting an increase in consumer demand and sell-through as compared to the same period in the prior year.\n\nCost of revenues for the first quarter of 2024 was approximately $8.2 million with a gross margin of 44.4%. Gross margin increased year over year primarily due to higher revenue and lower direct product and fulfillment costs.\n\nOperating expenses, including stock-based compensation, were approximately $12.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $15.1 million for the same period in 2023. Operating costs decreased year over year primarily due to transaction costs and lower spend on G&A costs to support the business.\n\nOperating loss was approximately $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income was approximately $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to net loss of approximately $11.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. Net income in the first quarter of 2024 is primarily driven by Owlet demonstrating stronger operating results year over year and a gain related to the Company's common stock warrants outstanding.\n\nA gain of approximately $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 resulted from a decrease in the fair value of common stock warrants outstanding as compared to a gain of approximately $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nBasic earnings per share was $0.15 for the first quarter of 2024, compared to basic net loss per share of ($1.54) for the first quarter of 2023.

Adjusted net loss per share was ($0.39) for the first quarter of 2024, compared to adjusted net loss per share of ($1.10) for the same period in 2023.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"Reform Act\"). All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company's expected financial performance, outlook based upon regulatory authorizations or product enhancements, growth prospects, and future operational efficiencies or results. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"estimate,\" \"may,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"goal,\" \"potential,\" \"upcoming,\" \"outlook,\" \"guidance,\" the negation thereof, or similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. For all such forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. The Company's actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Many important factors could affect the Company's future results and cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the Company's forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the regulatory pathway for Owlet's products, including submissions to, actions taken by and decisions and responses from regulators, such as the FDA and similar regulators outside of the United States, as well as Owlet's ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or certification for our products and other regulatory requirements and legal proceedings; (ii) Owlet's competition and the Company's ability to profitably grow and manage growth; (iii) the Company's ability to enhance future operating and financial results or obtain additional financing to continue as a going concern; (iv) Owlet's ability to obtain additional financing in the future, as well risks associated with the Company's current loan and debt agreements, including compliance with debt covenants, restrictions on the Company's access to capital, the impact of the Company's overall debt levels and the Company's ability to generate sufficient future cash flows to meet Owlet's debt service obligations and operate Owlet's business; (v) the ability of Owlet to implement strategic initiatives, reduce costs, grow revenues, develop and launch new products, innovate and enhance existing products, meet customer demands and adapt to changes in consumer preferences and retail trends; (vi) Owlet's ability to acquire, defend and protect its intellectual property and satisfy regulatory requirements, including but not limited to requirements concerning privacy and data protection, breaches and loss, as well as other risks associated with Owlet's digital platforms and technologies; (vii) Owlet's ability to maintain relationships with customers, manufacturers and suppliers and retain Owlet's management and key employees; (viii) Owlet's ability to upgrade and maintain its information technology systems; (ix) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (x) the impact of and disruption to Owlet's business, financial condition, operations, supply chain and logistics due to economic and other conditions beyond the Company's control, such as health epidemics or pandemics, macro-economic uncertainties, social unrest, hostilities, natural disasters or other catastrophic events; (xi) the possibility that Owlet may be adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory, competitive or other factors, such as changes in discretionary consumer spending and consumer preferences; and (xii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the Company's other releases, public statements and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including those identified in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and as any such factors may be updated from time to time in the Company's other filings with the SEC. All such forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company's behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. Moreover, the Company operates in an evolving environment. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, although Owlet may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\n\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share.\n\nThe Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company's peers and competitors. The Company believes its presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company's current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate its historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they exclude items that vary from period to period without correlation to the Company's core operating performance and highlight trends in its business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature of the items being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are not indicative of the Company's future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance in addition to the Company's performance based on GAAP results.\n\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net loss per share as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nEBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision and interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, interest income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, warrant liability adjustments, gain on loan forgiveness, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs.\n\nAdjusted net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for restructuring costs, common stock warrant liability adjustments, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs. Adjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss divided by weighted-average shares of common stock.\n\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company's presentation of these non-GAAP measures does not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share (and similarly titled financial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the Company's performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliation tables that accompany this release for additional information regarding certain of the non-GAAP financial measures included herein.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nOwlet will host a conference call and audio webcast today, May 6, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the conference call by telephone, please dial (833) 470-1428 (domestic) or +1 (404) 975-4839 (international) and reference Access Code 118135.

Net income in the first quarter of 2024 is primarily driven by Owlet demonstrating stronger operating results year over year and a gain related to the Company's common stock warrants outstanding.\n\nA gain of approximately $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 resulted from a decrease in the fair value of common stock warrants outstanding as compared to a gain of approximately $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nBasic earnings per share was $0.15 for the first quarter of 2024, compared to basic net loss per share of ($1.54) for the first quarter of 2023. Diluted net loss per share was ($0.51) for the first quarter of 2024, compared to diluted net loss per share of ($1.54) for the same period in 2023. Adjusted net loss per share was ($0.39) for the first quarter of 2024, compared to adjusted net loss per share of ($1.10) for the same period in 2023.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"Reform Act\"). All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company's expected financial performance, outlook based upon regulatory authorizations or product enhancements, growth prospects, and future operational efficiencies or results. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"estimate,\" \"may,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"goal,\" \"potential,\" \"upcoming,\" \"outlook,\" \"guidance,\" the negation thereof, or similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. For all such forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. The Company's actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Many important factors could affect the Company's future results and cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the Company's forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the regulatory pathway for Owlet's products, including submissions to, actions taken by and decisions and responses from regulators, such as the FDA and similar regulators outside of the United States, as well as Owlet's ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or certification for our products and other regulatory requirements and legal proceedings; (ii) Owlet's competition and the Company's ability to profitably grow and manage growth; (iii) the Company's ability to enhance future operating and financial results or obtain additional financing to continue as a going concern; (iv) Owlet's ability to obtain additional financing in the future, as well risks associated with the Company's current loan and debt agreements, including compliance with debt covenants, restrictions on the Company's access to capital, the impact of the Company's overall debt levels and the Company's ability to generate sufficient future cash flows to meet Owlet's debt service obligations and operate Owlet's business; (v) the ability of Owlet to implement strategic initiatives, reduce costs, grow revenues, develop and launch new products, innovate and enhance existing products, meet customer demands and adapt to changes in consumer preferences and retail trends; (vi) Owlet's ability to acquire, defend and protect its intellectual property and satisfy regulatory requirements, including but not limited to requirements concerning privacy and data protection, breaches and loss, as well as other risks associated with Owlet's digital platforms and technologies; (vii) Owlet's ability to maintain relationships with customers, manufacturers and suppliers and retain Owlet's management and key employees; (viii) Owlet's ability to upgrade and maintain its information technology systems; (ix) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (x) the impact of and disruption to Owlet's business, financial condition, operations, supply chain and logistics due to economic and other conditions beyond the Company's control, such as health epidemics or pandemics, macro-economic uncertainties, social unrest, hostilities, natural disasters or other catastrophic events; (xi) the possibility that Owlet may be adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory, competitive or other factors, such as changes in discretionary consumer spending and consumer preferences; and (xii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the Company's other releases, public statements and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including those identified in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and as any such factors may be updated from time to time in the Company's other filings with the SEC. All such forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company's behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. Moreover, the Company operates in an evolving environment. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, although Owlet may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\n\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share.\n\nThe Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company's peers and competitors. The Company believes its presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company's current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate its historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they exclude items that vary from period to period without correlation to the Company's core operating performance and highlight trends in its business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature of the items being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are not indicative of the Company's future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance in addition to the Company's performance based on GAAP results.\n\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net loss per share as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nEBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision and interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, interest income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, warrant liability adjustments, gain on loan forgiveness, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs.\n\nAdjusted net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for restructuring costs, common stock warrant liability adjustments, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs. Adjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss divided by weighted-average shares of common stock.\n\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company's presentation of these non-GAAP measures does not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share (and similarly titled financial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the Company's performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliation tables that accompany this release for additional information regarding certain of the non-GAAP financial measures included herein.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nOwlet will host a conference call and audio webcast today, May 6, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the conference call by telephone, please dial (833) 470-1428 (domestic) or +1 (404) 975-4839 (international) and reference Access Code 118135.

Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"potential\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"projects\", or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"will\", \"should\", \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\" or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance, including the Company's net revenue guidance for the second quarter, are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements and may involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the Company's current views and intentions with respect to future events, and current information available to the Company, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could cause the actual results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements to vary from those described herein should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize. These factors include, without limitation: the general business, market and economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates; significant capital requirements and operating risks that the Company may be subject to; the ability of the Company to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of the Company's common shares; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on the Company's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which the Company is exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Company; the Company's status as an emerging growth company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such events or concerns; as well as those risk factors discussed or referred to in the Company's disclosure documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, including the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada available at www.sedar.com. Should any factor affect the Company in an unexpected manner, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, the actual results or events may differ materially from the results or events predicted. Any such forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Moreover, the Company does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, other than as required by applicable law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release refers to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company's business that is not dependent on the impact of the Company's capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company's day-to-day operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for the Company's employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's internal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company's operational strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating performance in the same manner as management. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company's financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters the Company considers not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other companies in the Company's industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nThis press release refers to \"Adjusted EBITDA\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure that does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions. This modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation. The Company's presentation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a historical basis for the periods indicated:\n\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions.\n\nRefer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section above for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nVent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Securities_Litigation_Reform_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private Securities Litigation Reform Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542262", "eventUri": "eng-9542262", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 452725786, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 123, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 123}}}

Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"potential\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"projects\", or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"will\", \"should\", \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\" or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance, including the Company's net revenue guidance for the second quarter, are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements and may involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the Company's current views and intentions with respect to future events, and current information available to the Company, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could cause the actual results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements to vary from those described herein should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize. These factors include, without limitation: the general business, market and economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates; significant capital requirements and operating risks that the Company may be subject to; the ability of the Company to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of the Company's common shares; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on the Company's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which the Company is exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Company; the Company's status as an emerging growth company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such events or concerns; as well as those risk factors discussed or referred to in the Company's disclosure documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, including the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada available at www.sedar.com. Should any factor affect the Company in an unexpected manner, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, the actual results or events may differ materially from the results or events predicted. Any such forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Moreover, the Company does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, other than as required by applicable law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release refers to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company's business that is not dependent on the impact of the Company's capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company's day-to-day operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for the Company's employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's internal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company's operational strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating performance in the same manner as management. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company's financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters the Company considers not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other companies in the Company's industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nThis press release refers to \"Adjusted EBITDA\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure that does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions. This modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation. The Company's presentation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a historical basis for the periods indicated:\n\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions.\n\nRefer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section above for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nVent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Securities_Litigation_Reform_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private Securities Litigation Reform Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542262", "eventUri": "eng-9542262", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 452725786, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 123, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 123}}}

These factors include, without limitation: the general business, market and economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates; significant capital requirements and operating risks that the Company may be subject to; the ability of the Company to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of the Company's common shares; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on the Company's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which the Company is exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Company; the Company's status as an emerging growth company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such events or concerns; as well as those risk factors discussed or referred to in the Company's disclosure documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, including the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada available at www.sedar.com. Should any factor affect the Company in an unexpected manner, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, the actual results or events may differ materially from the results or events predicted. Any such forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Moreover, the Company does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, other than as required by applicable law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release refers to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company's business that is not dependent on the impact of the Company's capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company's day-to-day operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for the Company's employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's internal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company's operational strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating performance in the same manner as management. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company's financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters the Company considers not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other companies in the Company's industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nThis press release refers to \"Adjusted EBITDA\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure that does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions. This modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation. The Company's presentation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a historical basis for the periods indicated:\n\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions.\n\nRefer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section above for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nVent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Securities_Litigation_Reform_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private Securities Litigation Reform Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542262", "eventUri": "eng-9542262", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 452725786, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 127, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 127}}}

We made further progress procuring new business wins in the quarter, and we remain laser-focused on driving further operational efficiency improvements and growing our Electrical Systems segment to be our largest business. In line with the expected market softness contemplated in our outlook, we executed focused restructuring actions to address the lower demand environment. We are also taking additional steps to offset inflation and foreign exchange headwinds through customer recoveries and cost reductions. Collectively, we expect these actions to drive improved financial performance.\"\n\nMr. Ray concluded, \"I want to thank our talented global teams for their hard work to enable our transformation and drive us forward every day, and I am looking forward to our execution leading to improved financial results throughout fiscal 2024.\"\n\nAndy Cheung, Chief Financial Officer, added, \"Our first quarter results improved sequentially as we recovered from items that impacted the prior quarter. However, softer market conditions, as well as record quarterly revenue in the prior year period, led to year-over-year declines in revenues and profits. While we are reaffirming our annual guidance ranges for fiscal year 2024, deterioration in construction and agricultural end markets is offsetting the improved Class 8 truck build forecast. In response to these market developments, we are taking proactive cost actions that help underpin our Adjusted EBITDA guidance range. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong with 1.8x net leverage. Said differently, we are taking actions to proactively address current market conditions, and we expect improved profitability across our core business through the rest of the year.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\n\n(amounts in millions except per share data and percentages)\n\nOn March 31, 2024, the Company had $17.5 million of outstanding borrowings on its U.S. revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings on its China credit facility, $46.8 million of cash and $142.5 million of availability from the credit facilities, resulting in total liquidity of $189.3 million.\n\nCVG reaffirmed the following outlook for the full year 2024:\n\nThis outlook reflects among others, current industry forecasts for North America Class 8 truck builds. According to ACT Research, 2024 North American Class 8 truck production levels are expected to be at 305,000 units. The 2023 actual Class 8 truck builds according to the ACT Research was 340,247 units.\n\nAgriculture and construction market conditions have deteriorated relative to our prior update in March 2024. Based on industry data, we now project segments within global agriculture and construction market demand to be flat to down 10% in 2024.\n\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release is included as Appendix A to this release.\n\nConference Call\n\nA conference call to discuss this press release is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

These statements often include words such as \"believe\", \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\", \"would\", \"project\", \"continue\", \"likely\", and similar expressions. In particular, this press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company's expectations for future periods with respect to its plans to improve financial results, the future of the Company's end markets, changes in the Class 8 and Class 5-7 North America truck build rates, performance of the global construction equipment business, the Company's prospects in the wire harness, warehouse automation and electric vehicle markets, the Company's initiatives to address customer needs, organic growth, the Company's strategic plans and plans to focus on certain segments, competition faced by the Company, volatility in and disruption to the global economic environment and the Company's financial position or other financial information. These statements are based on certain assumptions that the Company has made in light of its experience as well as its perspective on historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results because of certain risks and uncertainties, including those included in the Company's filings with the SEC. There can be no assurance that statements made in this press release relating to future events will be achieved. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on behalf of the Company are expressly qualified in their entirety by such cautionary statements.\n\nOther Information\n\nThroughout this document, certain numbers in the tables or elsewhere may not sum due to rounding. Rounding may have also impacted the presentation of certain year-on-year percentage changes.\n\nThis earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").

We made further progress procuring new business wins in the quarter, and we remain laser-focused on driving further operational efficiency improvements and growing our Electrical Systems segment to be our largest business. In line with the expected market softness contemplated in our outlook, we executed focused restructuring actions to address the lower demand environment. We are also taking additional steps to offset inflation and foreign exchange headwinds through customer recoveries and cost reductions. Collectively, we expect these actions to drive improved financial performance.\"\n\nMr. Ray concluded, \"I want to thank our talented global teams for their hard work to enable our transformation and drive us forward every day, and I am looking forward to our execution leading to improved financial results throughout fiscal 2024.\"\n\nAndy Cheung, Chief Financial Officer, added, \"Our first quarter results improved sequentially as we recovered from items that impacted the prior quarter. However, softer market conditions, as well as record quarterly revenue in the prior year period, led to year-over-year declines in revenues and profits. While we are reaffirming our annual guidance ranges for fiscal year 2024, deterioration in construction and agricultural end markets is offsetting the improved Class 8 truck build forecast. In response to these market developments, we are taking proactive cost actions that help underpin our Adjusted EBITDA guidance range. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong with 1.8x net leverage. Said differently, we are taking actions to proactively address current market conditions, and we expect improved profitability across our core business through the rest of the year.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\n\n(amounts in millions except per share data and percentages)\n\nOn March 31, 2024, the Company had $17.5 million of outstanding borrowings on its U.S. revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings on its China credit facility, $46.8 million of cash and $142.5 million of availability from the credit facilities, resulting in total liquidity of $189.3 million.\n\nCVG reaffirmed the following outlook for the full year 2024:\n\nThis outlook reflects among others, current industry forecasts for North America Class 8 truck builds. According to ACT Research, 2024 North American Class 8 truck production levels are expected to be at 305,000 units. The 2023 actual Class 8 truck builds according to the ACT Research was 340,247 units.\n\nAgriculture and construction market conditions have deteriorated relative to our prior update in March 2024. Based on industry data, we now project segments within global agriculture and construction market demand to be flat to down 10% in 2024.\n\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release is included as Appendix A to this release.\n\nConference Call\n\nA conference call to discuss this press release is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

He was really worried.\u201d Mr Kosek, who is from Tychy in Poland, has now competed five times in Cork City Marathon, coming fifth in 2018, fourth in 2019, second in 2022 and first in 2023 and 2024, Ms Gierit said. \u201cThe organisation here is perfect, I would be very happy to be back next year,\u201d he said. David Mansfield, from Clonmel, who was recovering from a hip injury, came in second on 2:24:33. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonus to be standing and finishing and being competitive [after the injury],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really tough. The guy that won just had that extra gear for the last few miles.\u201d But the crowd really encouraged him on, and despite being a Tipperary man he felt hugely supported by the Cork crowds, he said. His sons Harry, 7, and Ollie, 5, and wife Eilish were at the finish line to greet him. \u201cIt was like a war,\u201d Tadar Mircia said after coming in third for a second year in a row at Cork City Marathon. \u201cIt was absolutely cruel. It was a very strong field with a very strong pace. I ran four minutes faster than last year [at a time of 2:25:21]. \u201cBut Pavel [the winner] is a machine. The winners of first and second place run under 2.20 PBs. \u201cThey are serious athletes, of a professional level.\u201d He hoisted his 10-month old son Avery onto the winning podium with him, holding a VIP pass in his tiny hands. His wife Melanie who is his \u201cbest coach, my hero\u201d was also there to support Mr Mircia, a dog groomer who is from Romania but now lives in Dublin. Smiling, sweaty faces paced through the city streets in sports gear and blue Cork City Marathon tops on Saturday afternoon. The city streets were zig-zagged by lanes of runners in colourful vests, bright bunting flags looped overhead between buildings. Winners crossed the finish line flanked by screaming crowds and encouragement on a deafening PA system. Some 10,000 people participated throughout the day in three events - the gruelling full marathon, the half marathon and a 10k race. Ice baths and water bottles waited for hot, dehydrated runners at the finish line. Aoife Cooke from Tower in Cork was the first woman to finish in Cork City Marathon with a time of 2:56:33. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Ms Cooke said on finishing the race first. \u201cThe atmosphere coming into the finish line is incredible.\u201d Although she also competed in the Tokyo Olympics she said that the \u201chome crowd is incredible\u201d in Cork and she would put Cork City Marathon up there with the best in the world. \u201cThe last few miles were tough,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re quite hilly.\u201d The winner only decided to enter \u201cat the last minute\u201d after a friend \u201cbullied\u201d her into it, she said laughing. Yulia Tarasova who fled the war in Ukraine with her children two years ago came in second place with a time of 3:00:57. Yulia also won the Tralee and Limerick marathons, she said, along with a marathon in Ukraine in 2018 and in other eastern European countries. \u201cWhen the war started we needed to move. It wasn\u2019t safe for my boys,\u201d she said. Windows in her apartment in Odessa were shattered and many buildings around her were destroyed by bombs. \u201cEvery day there were attacks,\u201d she said. \"Every day there were drones. \u201cI was feeling really depressed for the first year and half, it takes time to get used to it. \u201cNow every day starts with checking the news to see what happened in Ukraine at night. \u201cA lot of my friends have died,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI just hope the war ends soon.\u201d Her husband remained behind in Ukraine. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to contact him, she said. Becoming a refugee and suffering through war has been very difficult and it took time to adjust to their horrible new reality. But she loves Tralee and the beautiful nature in the area which gives her solace, she said. She works part-time in a hotel and her sons Yaroslav, now 6, and Dimitro, 10, have settled into school in Tralee, she said. \u201cI am so grateful for Ireland and the Irish people for the way they have helped us,\u201d she said. Andrea Aza Villamor was the third woman to cross the line on 3:05:15. Andrea, who is from Spain but lives in Ballincollig in Cork, said that it was a long, hot race. More than \u20ac100,000 has been raised for various local and national charities in association with the marathon. Some of those fundraising were the O\u2019Brien family. Dermot and Alison O\u2019Brien lost their 19 month old son Killian to meningitis 30 years ago. \u201cIt was his 30th anniversary in February so all the family started training for the marathon. We\u2019d never trained before,\u201d Dermot said. Four family members entered the half marathon and five entered the 10k. They have raised some \u20ac3,000 for Act for Meningitis on the page Run for Killian on iDonate. \u201cWhen it happened to is, there was no support,\u201d Dermot said. \u201cSo we wanted to raise a few bob to help others.\u201d Alison said: \u201cNothing was available 30 years ago in terms of counselling and support and there\u2019s still very little. We wanted to help.\u201d", "summary": "Pawel Kosek who is from Tychy in Poland, has now competed five times in Cork City Marathon, coming fifth in 2018, fourth in 2019, second in 2022 and first in 2023 and 2024", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/munster/arid-41407919.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8286/4143128_9_seoimage1x1_Cork_20City_20Marathon_202-6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:09:00", "author": "Irishexaminer.com,Liz Dunphy", "authors": ["Irishexaminer.com", "Liz Dunphy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.401}

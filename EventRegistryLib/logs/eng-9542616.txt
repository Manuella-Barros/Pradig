At 10.58pm two Penlee Lifeboats, the ALB Ivan Ellen and ILB Mollie & Ivor Dent, were launched after Falmouth Coastguard requested assistance to rescue a yacht and its crew near Penzance Promenade.\n\nThe Penlee Inshore Lifeboat, under the command of helmsman James Roberts, arrived on the scene and managed to get a line to the yacht despite the shallow water depth and poor conditions.\n\nRead more:\n\nCornwall death and funeral notices this week as families remember loved ones Callous murderer who 'liked hardman image' and sick rapist among those jailed\n\nLifeboat crews boarded the yacht and discovered that it was taking on a lot of water. The hull of the boat was badly damaged by the rocks, causing it to flood.\n\nThe yacht had to be pumped out every 20 minutes for two hours as it was rescued. Eventually, the yacht was pulled from the ground and towed to the north pier to allow it to dry out at low tide.\n\nDescribing the rescue on social media, Penlee Lifeboat said: \"Penlee Lifeboats save grounded yacht and crew last night.

Damage is believed to have been extensive - to the yacht, obviously, not to the wind. The incident happened earlier this week in Spetses, Greece. The country has been dealing with surprisingly high winds over recent days, peaking in the area on the day when the motor yacht Why ran aground. According to local reports cited by one major trade publication, the captain of Why was actually trying to prevent damage to the vessel and ironically ended up suffering the exact same fate.\n\nAs the local marina was experiencing lots of commotion because of the high winds, the captain of Why decided to sail away from the main town pier, into an area where he deemed chances of incurring damages as considerably lower. The wind ended up blowing the yacht onto the beach, where it ran aground, and then into another pier, into which it kept smashing repeatedly with its bow, unable to pull back because it was stuck.\n\nThe Coast Guard was called in to offer assistance and set up a floating crane in a bid to keep the yacht from repeatedly hitting the pier. Why eventually began taking on water, with eyewitnesses saying that damage to the hull was considerable.\n\nPhoto: YouTube/ProtoThema The only silver lining is that no one was hurt in the incident. As one of the videos below shows, when the yacht was blown onto the beach, it seemed to be carrying at least a handful of people, but they were probably on terra firma by the time it began smashing into the stone pier.\n\nAccording to the report, once Why is removed from its current location, a diver will inspect the area for any contaminants or damage to the reef. Should either be observed, an investigation will determine the next course of action, as well as who is responsible financially for covering the damages.\n\nWhy is a 2005 yacht designed and built by Italian shipyard Cantieri Navali Rizzardi, with an exterior design by Galeazzi Design and interiors by Michela Reverberi. It offers 193 GT of interior volume but accommodation for an unspecified number of guests because it was never offered for charter or publicly for sale. There is some indication that it was also registered as Zambezi.\n\nWith a GRP hull and superstructure, and powered by twin MTU engines, Why can max out at 32 knots (37 mph/59.2 kph). It was last refitted in 2017, but after this week's incident, it's heading back into the shop much sooner than the owner must have anticipated.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elena_gorgan@autoevolution.com", "name": "Elena Gorgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_grounding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ship grounding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spetses", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spetses"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spetses"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_captain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea captain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bow (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crane vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTU_Friedrichshafen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTU Friedrichshafen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superstructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross tonnage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_diving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwater diving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipyard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shipyard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Windsurfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Windsurfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/wind-blows-yacht-why-onto-the-beach-and-then-into-the-pier-233461_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542616", "eventUri": "eng-9542616", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

He filed a lawsuit against the school, which he won, and was able to resume play after missing just 11 games of the season.\n\nIn a statement following his suspension, Shannon's attorney maintained the player's innocence.\n\n\"My office learned that formal charges were filed against him...in Lawrence, Kansas,\" Shannon's attorney said in December.\n\n\"In less than 24 hours, my client responded, and he voluntarily surrendered to local authorities for processing and release. Terrence is innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.\"\n\nHe's now been cleared of any wrongdoing in the case.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_mccarty@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew McCarty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Shannon_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrence Shannon Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shannon County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shannon County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lawrence, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/bf/cbf99515-8119-5c80-bc2c-2a3f449b0879/666b5f8a972a1.image.jpg?crop=1071%2C562%2C0%2C118&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650816", "eventUri": "eng-9650816", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-22", "textStart": 760, "textEnd": 771}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Journal-World, whose cooperation makes this coverage possible, click here\n\nSign up for our Illini basketball newsletter here\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- A Douglas County jury on Thursday acquitted former Illini star Terrence Shannon Jr. of rape after deliberating less than two hours.\n\nEarlier, Shannon Jr. testified at his rape trial that he had never seen the woman who has accused him of sexual assault until proceedings in the case were well underway.\n\nShannon, 23, of Champaign, had been charged in Douglas County District Court with one felony count of rape or in the alternative one felony count of aggravated sexual battery.\n\nHe took the stand at the end of a four-day trial and said he was in Kansas on Sept. 8-9, 2023, after attending a football game between Illinois and the University of Kansas. He said after the game he met up with several Kansas basketball players at their dorm, McCarthy Hall.\n\nShannon said he, his two roommates from Illinois and a few Kansas players went to the Jayhawk Cafe, 1340 Ohio St., around 11 p.m. and drank in the Martini Room until the bar closed. He said he had only a few drinks throughout the evening and that he was not so drunk that he couldn't remember the night.\n\nShannon's attorney, Tricia Bath, asked him if he knew he was in a position where \"all eyes were on\" him.\n\nShannon said that was the case. Ever since high school he thought he had a real shot at going to the NBA and since then he has felt always under scrutiny, he said. He said he hopes to be selected for the NBA in the first two rounds later this month.\n\nHe said that night he knew he and the other players at the bar were the center of attention.\n\nBath then presented a photo of the bar room where a then 18-year-old woman had accused him of waving her over to him, pulling her through the crowd, grabbing her buttocks and sexually assaulting her under her skirt. She asked Shannon to show the jury where in the photo he was standing when those things happened.\n\n\"No, I cannot. I never did that,\" Shannon said. \"That did not happen.\"\n\nHe said that he had no such interaction with a woman that night and that he does not remember ever seeing the woman at all at the bar.\n\nBath asked if he would ever do something \"stupid\" like that especially with the goal of reaching the NBA so close at hand, to which Shannon responded \"no.\"\n\n\"It would kill my dreams,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he would never treat a woman that way because someone close to him had been raped and knowledge of that experience has stayed with him.\n\nShannon said he learned of the rape allegations weeks later and that it was then alleged that the incident had happened in a bathroom. A few weeks after that he was served a warrant to collect his DNA. He said he was confused because the warrant he received had misspelled his name.\n\n\"I thought maybe it was the wrong person because my name was spelled wrong,\" Shannon said.\n\nHe said he first saw the woman who had accused him of rape in May of 2024 at his preliminary hearing.\n\nEarlier today, UI assistant coach Tim Anderson testified that he has known Shannon since Shannon was in the eighth grade and, through tears, he said that he couldn't believe the allegations against Shannon.\n\nThe parties will present closing arguments Thursday afternoon, and then the jury will begin deliberations.\n\nAfter Shannon's testimony, Senior Assistant District Attorney Ricardo Leal delivered closing arguments and said that Shannon was a person accustomed to getting what he wanted. He said that Shannon's renown had earned him accommodations from his university in the form of scholarships, free clothes and food, and even a graduate assistant who was assigned as his personal chauffeur to get to and from Kansas.\n\n\"No one is disputing the work he has put in, but at this point, he gets what he wants,\" Leal said.\n\nOn the night in question, Leal argued, Shannon wanted that woman, and Shannon gets what he wants even if he doesn't ask for it.\n\nShannon's Chicago-based attorney Mark Sutter said in closing arguments that he was glad to not live in Kansas because he would be in fear of a prosecutor's office that would charge a man with rape with so little evidence.\n\n\"Those pursuing this case need to be called out,\" Sutter said.\n\nHe said he was surprised that the District Attorney's Office even filed the charge after Lawrence Police conducted such an underwhelming investigation. Sutter then attacked Lawrence Police Detective Joshua Leitner, repeatedly saying that Leitner made little effort to investigate and made no effort to find who the true culprit was.\n\nSutter said that police should have been investigating former Kansas basketball recruit Arterio Morris. He said Morris was accused of a similar act just weeks prior in the exact same location, and the victim in that case had the same body type and hair color as the victim in Shannon's case.\n\nHe asked what was more believable, Shannon coming as a guest to Kansas and committing this crime or someone like Morris who had already gotten away with it once?\n\nAs the Journal-World reported, Morris has not been charged with a crime in connection with the alleged assault at the bar on Aug. 26, 2023. He was charged with rape in connection with that alleged victim for an incident alleged to have happened later that night, but those charges were dismissed by the District Attorney's Office for insufficient evidence.\n\nSutter told the jury that the state's expert from the KBI said that the woman should have been covered in DNA, but the KBI found only trace amounts that were not enough to be tested. Sutter added that an independent expert hired by the defense reviewed those findings and, using different standards, determined there was male DNA on the woman's body that was not Shannon's.",

However, prosecutors argued that it was not a criminal trial and had different standards than these proceedings.\n\nShannon played the rest of the season for Illinois following the injunction and helped lead it to the Elite Eight, where it lost to eventual national champion UConn.\n\nHe is now preparing for the NBA draft.

Mandatory Credit: Dylan Widger-USA TODAY Sports / Dylan Widger-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer Illinois guard Terrence Shannon heard all the taunts for two months.\n\nAt each arena, he was ridiculed by opposing fans. The most popular one was, \"No Means No\" which was chanted so loud at the Big Ten tournament the NCAA had to step in. It all came to an end when Shannon was found not guilty on rape charges Thursday. They stemmed from an incident last September that caused a six-game suspension.\n\n\"With things like that, you got to let your game speak for yourself,\" Shannon said last month at the NBA Combine in Chicago. \"It's going to be distractions everywhere no matter if you got something going on or not. You just got to learn how to tune everything out and focus on the game.\"\n\nThe circumstances could have rattled Shannon but they didn't. It helped he had a strong support system from family and also the Illini basketball program. Former teammate Marcus Domask was the first to congratulate Shannon after the verdict was announced.\n\n\"Go be great in the league family,\" Domask posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWith Shannon off limits to speak the media, it was his teammates who did the talking for him during the regular season. They handle the burden of so many non-basketball related questions.\n\nFormer Illini forward Coleman Hawkins was Shannon's roommate for two years. While refusing to choose a side in the case, Hawkins just gave his thoughts on Shannon in March before their game against UConn in the Elite Eight.\n\n\"I think having an understanding of who he is as a person,\" Hawkins said. \"Terrence is a really great guy. Honestly, he's pretty shy. Having an understanding of who he is has been a big help for me, being a teammate first rather than looking at him as someone who has something going on.\"\n\nThe only thing Shannon has going on now is the NBA Draft later this month. Now, he can focus on what city he lands to begin his professional career.\n\nShandel Richardson is the publisher of Illini Now.

Shannon said he didn't learn of the rape allegation until several weeks later, and that he had never seen the 18-year-old woman who had accused him until the case had begun.\n\nThe woman told police she was at the bar when a man, whom she later identified as Shannon, grabbed her buttocks and reached under her skirt to touch her. The woman claimed that the bar was crowded, so she was unable to move.\n\nShannon testified that a woman close to him had been raped and he would never treat another woman the same way.\n\nShannon's lawyers called the allegations a \"blind accusation\" and questioned the motives of the woman.

He drew cheers as he invoked a new law signed in Louisiana this week requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom. \u201cHas anyone read the \u2018Thou shalt not steal\u2019? I mean, has anybody read this incredible stuff? It\u2019s just incredible,\u201d Trump said at the gathering of the Faith & Freedom Coalition. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it to go up. It\u2019s a crazy world.\u2019\u2019 Trump a day earlier posted an endorsement of the new law on his social media network, saying: \u201cI LOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AND MANY OTHER PLACES, FOR THAT MATTER. READ IT \u2014 HOW CAN WE, AS A NATION, GO WRONG???\u201d The former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee backed the move as he seeks to galvanize his supporters on the religious right, which has fiercely backed him after initially being suspicious of the twice-divorced New York City tabloid celebrity when he first ran for president in 2016. That support has continued despite his conviction in the first of four criminal cases he faces, in which a jury last month found him guilty of falsifying business records for what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. Trump\u2019s stated opposition to signing a nationwide ban on abortion and his reluctance to detail some of his views on the issue are at odds with many members of the evangelical movement, a key part of Trump\u2019s base that\u2019s expected to help him turn out voters in his November rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. But while many members of the movement would like to see him do more to restrict abortion, they cheer him as the greatest champion for the cause because of his role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned national abortion rights in 2022. Trump highlighted that Saturday, saying, \u201cWe did something that was amazing,\u201d but the issue would be left to people to decide in the states. \u201cEvery voter has to go with your heart and do what\u2019s right, but we also have to get elected,\u201d he said. While he still takes credit for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, Trump has also warned abortion can be tricky politically for Republicans. For months, he deferred questions about his position on a national ban. Last year, when Trump addressed the Faith & Freedom Coalition, he said there was \u201ca vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn life\u201d but didn\u2019t offer any details beyond that. In April of this year, Trump said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. He later stated in an interview that he would not sign a nationwide ban on abortion if it was passed by Congress. He has still declined to detail his position on women\u2019s access to the abortion pill mifepristone. About two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Attendees at the evangelical gathering on Saturday said that while they\u2019d like to see a national abortion ban, Trump isn\u2019t losing any of their deep support. \u201cI would prefer if he would sign a national ban,\u201d said Jerri Dickinson, a 78-year-old retired social worker and Faith & Freedom member from New Jersey. \u201cI understand though, that as in accordance with the Constitution, that decision should be left up to the states.\u201d Dickinson said she can\u2019t stand the abortion law in her state, which does not set limits on the procedure based on gestational age. But she said outside of preferring a national ban, leaving the issue to the state \u201cis the best alternative.\u201d According to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters supported Trump in 2020, and nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters identified as white evangelical Christians. White evangelical Christians made up about 20% of the overall electorate that year. Beyond just offering their own support in the general election, the Faith & Freedom Coalition plans to help get out the vote for Trump and other Republicans, aiming to use volunteers and paid workers to knock on millions of doors in battleground states. Trump is also rallying voters in Philadelphia, where supporters were gathering to hear him speak at an arena. Tyler Cecconi, 25, of Richmond, Virginia, said he\u2019s glad that Trump is stepping out of his comfort zone and going to places that may not be red. At the venue, organizers hung a banner that read \u201cPhiladelphia is Trump Country.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s showing the people that regardless if you vote for him or not, or if it\u2019s a blue county or a red county, it doesn\u2019t matter to him,\u201d Cecconi said. \u201cA president is for everybody in this country.\u201d The GOP Senate candidate of Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, attended the rally and appeared on stage to talk to voters about the economy and immigration. \u201cThis economy is not working for most Pennsylvanians and it\u2019s not working for most Americans,\u201d McCormick said. Earlier in Washington, Trump returned several times during his roughly 90-minute remarks to the subject of the U.S.-Mexico border and at one point, when describing migrants crossing it as \u201ctough,\u201d he joked that he told his friend Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to enlist them in a new version of the sport. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you set up a migrant league and have your regular league of fighters. And then you have the champion of your league, these are the greatest fighters in the world, fighting the champion of the migrants,\u2019\u201d Trump described saying to White. \u201cI think the migrant guy might win, that\u2019s how tough they are. He didn\u2019t like that idea too much.\u201d His story drew laughs and claps from the crowd. \u201cTrump\u2019s incoherent, unhinged tirade showed voters in his own words that he is a threat to our freedoms and is too dangerous to be let anywhere near the White House again,\u201d campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.

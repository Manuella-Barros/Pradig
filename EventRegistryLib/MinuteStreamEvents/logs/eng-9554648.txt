Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, told reporters at a news conference slamming Biden's comments. \"It would also, I have to add, be grounds for impeachment under the Democrats' Trump-Ukraine standard -- withholding foreign aid to help one's reelection. Only with Joe Biden, it's true.\"\n\nBiden signaled on Wednesday that he had lost patience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet's leadership of the nation's war against Hamas. He emphasized his red line if Israeli forces launch a major invasion of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where millions are sheltering amid the war. Biden said if such a major invasion happens, the US will not supply Israel \"weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities.\"\n\nBiden also confirmed that his administration has already delayed a shipment of thousands of bombs. Israel has already gone into Rafah, but Biden characterized their current level of involvement as short of his red line.\n\nRepublicans have torched the president over his warning. Some, including Cotton, have gone so far as to compare his actions to then-President Trump's decision to pause aid to Ukraine temporarily. House Democrats impeached Trump for his actions.\n\nNot everyone is sold. Cotton. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a noted Trump ally, cautioned that while someone could \"make a good argument\" in favor of impeachment, that was not his goal.\n\n\"I didn't come here to impeach the president,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told reporters at the same news conference. \"I came to here to let everyone know we don't agree with this decision.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering what specifically got Trump in trouble. There are numerous differences between then and now.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, formally concluded that the Trump administration broke the law in withholding congressionally approved aid to Ukraine. The watchdog concluded that Trump violated a Nixon-era law by withholding about $214 million in defense aid. The Trump White House disputed the report, but the office was unmoved by its defense.\n\n\"Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,\" the watchdog concluded.\n\nIt's unlikely that Biden would be found to have violated the law if the White House spent the congressionally approved aid on Israel by the end of the fiscal year in September, according to a defense policy expert.\n\n\"The fact that Congress has enacted money to support Israel means the president has to spend it,\" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Washington DC-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider. \"So basically, he's going to have to spend that money on Israel as Congress appropriated, but he doesn't have to do that today.\"\n\nCancian did caution that the current bomb shipment Biden has paused likely has a different deadline, but it's not immediately clear which tranche of money that falls under. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US sends roughly $3.3 billion to Israel a year, mostly through grants that Israel must, in turn, use to purchase US military goods and services.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about the letter of the law. One of House Democrats' impeachment articles cited a \"scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit.\" Trump's withholding of aid wasn't the offense alone.\n\nThe issue was whether Trump took official action, delaying aid to benefit a private scheme to get the Ukraine government to help dig up dirt on Hunter Biden. Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland, later confirmed a quid-pro-quo did take place.\n\nRepublicans have accused Biden of withholding weapons due to concerns about his reelection. Multiple Republicans cited the president's standing in Michigan, a key swing state, where over 100,000 people voted \"uncommitted\" in the state's Democratic presidential primary in an organized campaign to protest Biden's support of Israel.\n\n\"Why is it on hold? To appease his liberal base in places like Dearborn, Michigan, because Joe Biden is in trouble in Michigan,\" Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the leader of the Senate GOP's campaign arm, told reporters.\n\nBiden has repeatedly expressed concern about civilians dying during the war. According to Gaza health officials, about 34,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed there. US allies -- the United Kingdom, France, and Germany -- have all expressed concern about an invasion of Rafah.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan blocked the transfer of F-16s to Israel in 1983 when its forces were in Lebanon. He cited a belief that doing so could violate the law, according to The New York Times. President George H.W. Bush also threatened loan guarantees in 1991 when then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wouldn't abide by his desired limitation on funding for settlements on occupied territory.\n\nTrump himself was involved in another dispute. His administration withheld a $105 million package to support the Lebanese Armed Forces. Trump's delay occurred around when Congress was already probing his actions related to Ukraine.\n\nBiden relied on a bipartisan coalition to pass a $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a political risk in backing the package with little changes after House conservatives had threatened his future if he tried to pass additional Ukraine aid. (On Wednesday, Johnson easily survived a push led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, to oust him from power.)\n\nJohnson has heavily criticized Biden's move.\n\n\"What the President is doing here is not only defying the will of Congress, to your point, we just voted on this several days ago,\" Johnson said on CNBC. \"But he's also trying to dictate, I guess, and micromanage the war, the defense effort in Israel, as a condition of supplying the weapons that we all know that they desperately need.\"\n\nThat said, while Biden will need bipartisan support to keep the government funded in September, he likely will not ask for more Ukraine aid anytime soon", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton", "type": "person",

Cory Mills, R-Fla., is preparing impeachment articles against President Biden over his threat to halt U.S. offensive aid to Israel, the first-term lawmaker told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\nMills accused Biden of forcing Israel into a \"quid pro quo\" situation by leveraging U.S. dollars against the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, drawing parallels to Democrats' first impeachment of former President Trump over his handling of Ukraine aid.\n\n\"The House has no choice but to impeach President 'Quid pro Joe' Biden. As Vice President, Biden was caught threatening to withhold funding and aid to Ukraine unless they fired the attorney general investigating Burisma, a company financially benefiting his son Hunter, not to mention the 10% share for 'the big guy' himself,\" Mills said in a statement.\n\n\"Now, Joe Biden is pressuring Israel, our biggest ally in the Middle East, by pausing their funding that has already been approved in the House, if they don't stop all operations with Hamas. It's a very clear message, 'this for that.'\n\n\"These are the same accusations made against President Trump, which resulted in his impeachment by Democrats. The same must happen for Joe Biden, which is why we're drawing up articles of impeachment now,\" Mills finished.\n\nBiden made the high-stakes ultimatum to Israel's government in a CNN interview that aired Wednesday night as it prepares for a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The city is currently home to more than a million Palestinians who left other parts of the Gaza Strip, where Israel has conducted its mission to eradicate the terrorist group Hamas.\n\nBiden said Israel would continue to see U.S. support for its defensive systems, like the Iron Dome, in the CNN interview. He added, however, \"if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.\"\n\nThe remarks prompted a flurry of backlash from Republicans and some moderate Democrats. Several more GOP lawmakers voiced support for impeaching Biden over the decision, arguing there are parallels to Trump's withholding of weapons aid to Ukraine in exchange for announcing an investigation into the Biden family.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., called on the House to open an immediate impeachment inquiry, arguing that Biden was motivated by political reasons.\n\n\"Given Democrats' Trump-Ukraine precedent, President Biden's decision to withhold lethal aid to our ally, Israel, for political gain is undoubtedly an impeachable offense. Clearly, the nefarious motive behind our commander in chief's move to condition U.S. aid to Israel is to appease radical leftists and Hamas sympathizers ahead of the 2024 election,\" Clyde said. \"The House must immediately open an impeachment inquiry due to the president's disastrous decision to play politics with national security.\"\n\nRep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital, \"The Democrats made their bed, and now they're [lying] in it. This is just the latest on a long list of reasons to impeach Biden, including the deadline withdrawal in Afghanistan and allowing more than 9 million illegal immigrants to invade our southern border.\"\n\nIt's highly unlikely for the push to reach the level of a Senate trial, with the House's current ongoing impeachment inquiry into Biden still searching for smoking gun evidence amid a mountain of accusations of improper behavior and bribery.\n\nBut it shows the sky-high tensions that have taken over Washington amid Israel's war on Hamas after the terrorist group's Oct. 7 attack.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., stopped short of calling for impeachment, but said, \"The president is essentially threatening an arms embargo on our closest ally in the Middle East that is fighting a terror army holding American citizens hostage. Withholding critical munitions that Congress appropriated and Biden himself signed into law is wrong.\"\n\nThe first member of Congress to make the call was Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., posting on X early on Thursday morning, \"The House has no choice but to impeach Biden based on the Trump-Ukraine precedent of withholding foreign aid to help with reelection.

Sen. Tom Cotton compared Biden's threat to withhold weapons to Israel to Trump's first impeachment. There are numerous differences between Biden's comments and how Trump handled Ukraine aid.\n\nSome Republicans and conservatives are so aghast that President Joe Biden is threatening to withhold offensive weapons from Israel that they are raising the specter of impeachment.\n\n\"Now some people say Joe Biden is doing this for reelection, which would be bad enough,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, told reporters at a news conference slamming Biden's comments. \"It would also, I have to add, be grounds for impeachment under the Democrats' Trump-Ukraine standard -- withholding foreign aid to help one's reelection. Only with Joe Biden, it's true.\"\n\nBiden signaled on Wednesday that he had lost patience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet's leadership of the nation's war against Hamas. He emphasized his red line if Israeli forces launch a major invasion of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where millions are sheltering amid the war. Biden said if such a major invasion happens, the US will not supply Israel \"weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities.\"\n\nBiden also confirmed that his administration has already delayed a shipment of thousands of bombs. Israel has already gone into Rafah, but Biden characterized their current level of involvement as short of his red line.\n\nRepublicans have torched the president over his warning. Some, including Cotton, have gone so far as to compare his actions to then-President Trump's decision to pause aid to Ukraine temporarily. House Democrats impeached Trump for his actions.\n\nNot everyone is sold. Cotton. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a noted Trump ally, cautioned that while someone could \"make a good argument\" in favor of impeachment, that was not his goal.\n\n\"I didn't come here to impeach the president,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told reporters at the same news conference. \"I came to here to let everyone know we don't agree with this decision.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering what specifically got Trump in trouble. There are numerous differences between then and now.\n\nA government watchdog found Trump broke the law.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, formally concluded that the Trump administration broke the law in withholding congressionally approved aid to Ukraine. The watchdog concluded that Trump violated a Nixon-era law by withholding about $214 million in defense aid. The Trump White House disputed the report, but the office was unmoved by its defense.\n\n\"Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,\" the watchdog concluded.\n\nIt's unlikely that Biden would be found to have violated the law if the White House spent the congressionally approved aid on Israel by the end of the fiscal year in September, according to a defense policy expert.\n\n\"The fact that Congress has enacted money to support Israel means the president has to spend it,\" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Washington DC-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider. \"So basically, he's going to have to spend that money on Israel as Congress appropriated, but he doesn't have to do that today.\"\n\nCancian did caution that the current bomb shipment Biden has paused likely has a different deadline, but it's not immediately clear which tranche of money that falls under. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US sends roughly $3.3 billion to Israel a year, mostly through grants that Israel must, in turn, use to purchase US military goods and services.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about the letter of the law. One of House Democrats' impeachment articles cited a \"scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit.\" Trump's withholding of aid wasn't the offense alone.\n\nThe issue was whether Trump took official action, delaying aid to benefit a private scheme to get the Ukraine government to help dig up dirt on Hunter Biden. Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland, later confirmed a quid-pro-quo did take place.\n\nRepublicans have accused Biden of withholding weapons due to concerns about his reelection. Multiple Republicans cited the president's standing in Michigan, a key swing state, where over 100,000 people voted \"uncommitted\" in the state's Democratic presidential primary in an organized campaign to protest Biden's support of Israel.\n\n\"Why is it on hold? To appease his liberal base in places like Dearborn, Michigan, because Joe Biden is in trouble in Michigan,\" Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the leader of the Senate GOP's campaign arm, told reporters.\n\nBiden has repeatedly expressed concern about civilians dying during the war. According to Gaza health officials, about 34,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed there. US allies -- the United Kingdom, France, and Germany -- have all expressed concern about an invasion of Rafah.\n\nOther presidents have paused weapons shipments.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan blocked the transfer of F-16s to Israel in 1983 when its forces were in Lebanon. He cited a belief that doing so could violate the law, according to The New York Times. President George H.W. Bush also threatened loan guarantees in 1991 when then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wouldn't abide by his desired limitation on funding for settlements on occupied territory.\n\nTrump himself was involved in another dispute. His administration withheld a $105 million package to support the Lebanese Armed Forces. Trump's delay occurred around when Congress was already probing his actions related to Ukraine.\n\nThis doesn't mean there won't be costs for Biden.\n\nBiden relied on a bipartisan coalition to pass a $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a political risk in backing the package with little changes after House conservatives had threatened his future if he tried to pass additional Ukraine aid. (On Wednesday, Johnson easily survived a push led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, to oust him from power.)\n\nJohnson has heavily criticized Biden's move.\n\n\"What the President is doing here is not only defying the will of Congress, to your point, we just voted on this several days ago,\" Johnson said on CNBC. \"But he's also trying to dictate, I guess, and micromanage the war, the defense effort in Israel, as a condition of supplying the weapons that we all know that they desperately need.\"\n\nThat said, while Biden will need bipartisan support to keep the government funded in September, he likely will not ask for more Ukraine aid anytime soon\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_d_griffiths@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Brent D.

Cory Mills (R-FL) said Thursday he's preparing articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden for pausing weapons delivery to Israel, as the decision drew swift backlash from Republicans and some centrist Democrats.\n\nThe Florida Republican argued Biden's move to delay military aid, including 2,000-pound bombs, amid disapproval over Israel's plans to expand military operations in southern Gaza, is similar to Democrats' first impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, in which he withheld aid to Ukraine in exchange for announcing an investigation into the Biden family.\n\n\"The House has no choice but to impeach President 'Quid pro Joe' Biden,\" Mills said in a statement to Fox News. \"As Vice President, Biden was caught threatening to withhold funding and aid to Ukraine unless they fired the attorney general investigating Burisma, a company financially benefiting his son Hunter, not to mention the 10% share for 'the big guy' himself.\"\n\n\"Now, Joe Biden is pressuring Israel, our biggest ally in the Middle East, by pausing their funding that has already been approved in the House, if they don't stop all operations with Hamas. It's a very clear message, 'this for that,'\" Mills added.\n\nThe House's impeachment of Trump in 2019 resulted in a charge of abuse of power, referencing he withheld aid to Ukraine while asking President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, which included Biden. The Senate eventually acquitted Trump.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Biden said he would not supply offensive weapons to Israel that could be used in Rafah, the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza, where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. Biden said the U.S. would still be committed to Israel's defense and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive weapons.\n\nShortly after the interview, former Vice President Mike Pence dangled the idea of impeachment if Biden doesn't honor the foreign aid commitments approved by Congress. Biden recently signed into law a $95 billion foreign aid package that included about $26 billion for both Israel and humanitarian aid for Gaza.\n\n\"I'm old enough to remember when Democrats impeached another President for supposedly withholding foreign aid that had been approved by Congress,\" Pence said of Trump's first impeachment involving aid to Ukraine. \"Stop the threats Joe. America Stands with Israel!\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said the House must abide by the precedent Democrats set in 2019 during Trump's 2019 impeachment.\n\n\"The House has no choice but to impeach Biden based on the Trump-Ukraine precedent of withholding foreign aid to help with reelection. Only with Biden, it's true,\" Cotton posted on X.\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem like other Republican senators share Cotton's view. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) condemned Biden's decision to withhold the weapons shipment during a press conference with other Republican colleagues and made it clear his aim was to urge the president to reverse course when asked by reporters about whether Biden should be impeached.\n\n\"I didn't come here to talk about that, given what they did to Trump, I think you could make a good argument. But, I didn't come here to impeach the president,\" Graham said to reporters. \"I came here to let everybody know we don't agree with this decision.\"\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said she hadn't thought about the impeachment comparisons.\n\n\"I never thought about it like that, but I disagree with the strategy and I questioned the secretary of defense about it yesterday -- they confirmed it,\" Capito told the Washington Examiner. \"I mean, I literally am quite shocked after all we went through to get that aid there.\"\n\nAsked about the decision to delay the shipment at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed the paused shipment and said no \"final determination\" about sending military assistance had been made.\n\n\"We've been very clear from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack on Rafah without accounting for and protecting those civilians that are hitting that battlespace,\" Austin testified. \"And, again, as we have assessed the situation, we paused one shipment of high payload munitions.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the vice chairwoman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, said she did not believe halting the weapons shipment was an impeachable offense but expressed concern about not being properly informed of the administration's actions.\n\n\"I'm looking into exactly what should have been done about informing us because I learned about it from Axios over the weekend,\" Collins said. \"I'm the vice chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and worked very hard to get that funded.\"\n\n\"So, on foreign military sales, it's more defined on the approvals you have to get, so I don't know, I'm not sure which category the weapons fall into,\" she added.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) also questioned whether impeachment would be an appropriate response, and emphasized impeachment should not be thrown around.\n\n\"I wonder -- [Biden] is obviously not following the letter of the law, so I'm going to leave it to an attorney to determine whether or not that is a criminal violation or a violation of trust. I don't know,\" Tillis told the Washington Examiner.\n\n\"I'm pretty dogmatic when it comes to the use of impeachment, I think it should be rare. I think it should clearly point to what a non-legal person like myself could say, 'OK, that's a high crime, that's a misdemeanor,' versus just an absolute failure in leadership. That one I understand,\" he added.\n\nTillis called out Democrats who voted to impeach Trump on similar grounds and who don't view Biden's recent actions in the same capacity.\n\n\"For the people around here who have situational ethics, they may have been against it when Trump did it, but for some reason they are wearing the same jersey as Biden -- I have no use for that, I mean they are all good people, I have no use for their rationalizations,\" he said. \"It's wrong, no matter what jersey the president has on, when they violate intent and the letter of a statute.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who voted to impeach Trump during the first Senate trial, said he does not see a parallel between Biden's pausing of military aid to Israel and Trump's withholding of aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into his political rivals.\n\n\"I see more of a parallel with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush withholding military aid to achieve influence over Israeli actions,\" Blumenthal told the Washington Examiner. \"It should not prevent us from continuing military aid, which I hope we will, we have a moral obligation and self-interest in continuing military aid to Israel, which I think we will do. Israel has a right to defend itself.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who has been outspoken about his disapproval of Biden's pause of the weapons to Israel, joked about the potential of impeaching the president.\n\n\"Months ago -- I was like, 'No, no, please don't.' Now I'm like, 'Go ahead and do that dumb s***,'\" Fetterman said with a laugh.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Pennsylvania senator referenced his tongue-in-cheek gift to Rep. James Comer (R-KY) when he held the first hearing for Republicans' impeachment inquiry into Biden last year. The inquiry, which looked into accusations that Biden used his influence to help his son's business, fell apart.\n\n\"In fact, I delivered a case of Bud Light to Comer over there and I'm like, 'Go

Only with Biden, it's true,\" Cotton said in a post to X.\n\nBiden is under immense pressure from the left wing of the Democratic Party to be harsher on Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as he competes against Trump for another term in the White House.\n\nDuring a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Biden said he \"made it clear\" to Israel that if it conducts a major ground operation in Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) used a \"Fox and Friends\" appearance on Thursday to accuse Biden of betraying a deal that was made with lawmakers to pass a $95 billion foreign aid bill last month that included support for Israel.\n\n\"He's defying the will of Congress and he's defying what his own top officials in the White House assured me in writing and verbally before that supplemental was passed and even in the days since,\" Johnson said.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how much support Cotton's push for an Israel-focused impeachment will get in the House, but Biden is already facing a corruption-focused inquiry led by Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY).\n\nDemocratic strategist Kevin Walling argued on Fox News that former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used the same foreign policy \"tool\" as Biden is doing with Israel, while asserting Trump got impeached because he sought dirt on Biden -- his political rival -- from Ukraine.\n\nIn a prior strike against the Biden administration, the House voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis, but the Democrat-controlled Senate quashed the charges last month before a full trial could be held.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First impeachment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comer_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Comer (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nSome Republicans and conservatives are so aghast that President Joe Biden is threatening to withhold offensive weapons from Israel that they are raising the specter of impeachment.\n\n\"Now some people say Joe Biden is doing this for reelection, which would be bad enough,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, told reporters at a news conference slamming Biden's comments. \"It would also, I have to add, be grounds for impeachment under the Democrats' Trump-Ukraine standard -- withholding foreign aid to help one's reelection. Only with Joe Biden, it's true.\"\n\nBiden signaled on Wednesday that he had lost patience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet's leadership of the nation's war against Hamas. He emphasized his red line if Israeli forces launch a major invasion of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where millions are sheltering amid the war. Biden said if such a major invasion happens, the US will not supply Israel \"weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities.\"\n\nBiden also confirmed that his administration has already delayed a shipment of thousands of bombs. Israel has already gone into Rafah, but Biden characterized their current level of involvement as short of his red line.\n\nRepublicans have torched the president over his warning. Some, including Cotton, have gone so far as to compare his actions to then-President Trump's decision to pause aid to Ukraine temporarily. House Democrats impeached Trump for his actions.\n\nNot everyone is sold. Cotton. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a noted Trump ally, cautioned that while someone could \"make a good argument\" in favor of impeachment, that was not his goal.\n\n\"I didn't come here to impeach the president,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told reporters at the same news conference. \"I came to here to let everyone know we don't agree with this decision.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering what specifically got Trump in trouble. There are numerous differences between then and now.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, formally concluded that the Trump administration broke the law in withholding congressionally approved aid to Ukraine. The watchdog concluded that Trump violated a Nixon-era law by withholding about $214 million in defense aid. The Trump White House disputed the report, but the office was unmoved by its defense.\n\n\"Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,\" the watchdog concluded.\n\nIt's unlikely that Biden would be found to have violated the law if the White House spent the congressionally approved aid on Israel by the end of the fiscal year in September, according to a defense policy expert.\n\n\"The fact that Congress has enacted money to support Israel means the president has to spend it,\" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Washington DC-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider. \"So basically, he's going to have to spend that money on Israel as Congress appropriated, but he doesn't have to do that today.\"\n\nCancian did caution that the current bomb shipment Biden has paused likely has a different deadline, but it's not immediately clear which tranche of money that falls under. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US sends roughly $3.3 billion to Israel a year, mostly through grants that Israel must, in turn, use to purchase US military goods and services.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about the letter of the law. One of House Democrats' impeachment articles cited a \"scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit.\" Trump's withholding of aid wasn't the offense alone.\n\nThe issue was whether Trump took official action, delaying aid to benefit a private scheme to get the Ukraine government to help dig up dirt on Hunter Biden. Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland, later confirmed a quid-pro-quo did take place.\n\nRepublicans have accused Biden of withholding weapons due to concerns about his reelection. Multiple Republicans cited the president's standing in Michigan, a key swing state, where over 100,000 people voted \"uncommitted\" in the state's Democratic presidential primary in an organized campaign to protest Biden's support of Israel.\n\n\"Why is it on hold? To appease his liberal base in places like Dearborn, Michigan, because Joe Biden is in trouble in Michigan,\" Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the leader of the Senate GOP's campaign arm, told reporters.\n\nBiden has repeatedly expressed concern about civilians dying during the war. According to Gaza health officials, about 34,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed there. US allies -- the United Kingdom, France, and Germany -- have all expressed concern about an invasion of Rafah.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan blocked the transfer of F-16s to Israel in 1983 when its forces were in Lebanon. He cited a belief that doing so could violate the law, according to The New York Times. President George H.W. Bush also threatened loan guarantees in 1991 when then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wouldn't abide by his desired limitation on funding for settlements on occupied territory.\n\nTrump himself was involved in another dispute. His administration withheld a $105 million package to support the Lebanese Armed Forces. Trump's delay occurred around when Congress was already probing his actions related to Ukraine.\n\nBiden relied on a bipartisan coalition to pass a $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a political risk in backing the package with little changes after House conservatives had threatened his future if he tried to pass additional Ukraine aid. (On Wednesday, Johnson easily survived a push led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, to oust him from power.)\n\nJohnson has heavily criticized Biden's move.\n\n\"What the President is doing here is not only defying the will of Congress, to your point, we just voted on this several days ago,\" Johnson said on CNBC. \"But he's also trying to dictate, I guess, and micromanage the war, the defense effort in Israel, as a condition of supplying the weapons that we all know that they desperately need.\"\n\nThat said, while Biden will need bipartisan support to keep the government funded in September, he likely will not ask for more Ukraine aid anytime soon", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_d_griffiths@businessinsider.com", "name": "Brent D.

Cory Mills, R-Fla., is preparing impeachment articles against President Biden over his threat to halt U.S. offensive aid to Israel, the first-term lawmaker told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\nMills accused Biden of forcing Israel into a \"quid pro quo\" situation by leveraging U.S. dollars against the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, drawing parallels to Democrats' first impeachment of former President Trump over his handling of Ukraine aid.\n\n\"The House has no choice but to impeach President 'Quid pro Joe' Biden. As Vice President, Biden was caught threatening to withhold funding and aid to Ukraine unless they fired the attorney general investigating Burisma, a company financially benefiting his son Hunter, not to mention the 10% share for 'the big guy' himself,\" Mills said in a statement.\n\n\"Now, Joe Biden is pressuring Israel, our biggest ally in the Middle East, by pausing their funding that has already been approved in the House, if they don't stop all operations with Hamas. It's a very clear message, 'this for that.'\n\nMANY ISRAELIS FEEL 'BETRAYED' FOLLOWING BIDEN THREAT TO WITHHOLD ARMS TO DEFEAT HAMAS IN RAFAH\n\n\"These are the same accusations made against President Trump, which resulted in his impeachment by Democrats. The same must happen for Joe Biden, which is why we're drawing up articles of impeachment now,\" Mills finished.\n\nBiden made the high-stakes ultimatum to Israel's government in a CNN interview that aired Wednesday night as it prepares for a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which is currently housing over a million Palestinians that left other parts of the Gaza Strip, where Israel has conducted its mission to eradicate terror group Hamas.\n\nHe said Israel would continue to see U.S. support for its defensive systems like the Iron Dome, in a CNN interview that aired Wednesday night. He added, however, \"if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.\"\n\nBIDEN'S DECISION TO PULL ISRAEL WEAPONS SHIPMENT KEPT QUIET UNTIL AFTER HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE ADDRESS: REPORT\n\nIt's prompted a flurry of backlash from Republicans and some moderate Democrats. Several more GOP lawmakers voiced support for impeaching Biden over the decision, arguing there are parallels to Trump's withholding of weapons aid to Ukraine in exchange for announcing an investigation into the Biden family.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., called on the House to open an immediate impeachment inquiry, arguing that Biden was motivated by political reasons.\n\n\"Given Democrats' Trump-Ukraine precedent, President Biden's decision to withhold lethal aid to our ally, Israel, for political gain is undoubtedly an impeachable offense. Clearly, the nefarious motive behind our Commander-in-Chief's move to condition U.S. aid to Israel is to appease radical leftists and Hamas sympathizers ahead of the 2024 election,\" Clyde said. \"The House must immediately open an impeachment inquiry due to the President's disastrous decision to play politics with national security.\"\n\nRep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital, \"The Democrats made their bed, and now they're [lying] in it. This is just the latest on a long list of reasons to impeach Biden, including the deadline withdrawal in Afghanistan and allowing more than 9 million illegal immigrants to invade our southern border.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION INVESTIGATING EMORY UNIVERSITY FOR ALLEGED ANTI-MUSLIM DISCRIMINATION\n\nIt's highly unlikely for the push to reach the level of a Senate trial, with the House's current ongoing impeachment inquiry into Biden still searching for smoking gun evidence amid a mountain of accusations of improper behavior and bribery.\n\nBut it shows the sky-high tensions that have taken over Washington amid Israel's war on Hamas after the militant group's Oct. 7 attack.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., stopped short of calling for impeachment but said, \"The president is essentially threatening an arms embargo on our closest ally in the Middle East that is fighting a terror army holding American citizens hostage.

threatened to stop supplying Israel with weapons if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued his plans for a full-scale campaign into Rafah, a city in Gaza where over 1 million Palestinians

I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah; to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem.\"\n\n\"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently.

He can't withhold aid for political convenience.\"\n\nThe Indiana Republican said Democrats used the same exact argument to impeach then-President Donald Trump over his 2018 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump reportedly asked Zelenskyy to look into the Hunter Biden-Burisma affair while dangling $214 million in U.S. security assistance, which Democrats considered an act of soliciting foreign election interference.\n\n\"Israel is our most cherished ally,\" Pence went on to say. \"And they deserve American support to defeat Hamas - not to be used as a political pawn.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Sen.

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., at a December 2019 impeachment inquiry hearing, he alleged Trump's call with Zelenskyy was part of \"concerted effort\" to \"solicit a personal advantage in the next election -- this time, in the form of an investigation of his political adversaries by a foreign government.\"\n\nIn an apparent response to Biden's warning, Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, introduced the Immediate Support for Israel Act on Friday, which she said would force the administration to deliver aid and support that is passed by Congress.\n\n\"Weeks ago, Congress came together in a bipartisan manner to pass an aid package for Israel. In an unprecedented move, President Biden not only halted the shipment of aid but also unilaterally added conditions to that very same aid - defying Congressional intent. Israel is currently engaged in a war with a terrorist organization that is still holding over 100 civilian hostages. There is simply no excuse for this delay,\" Van Duyne said in a statement obtained by Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a statement in Hebrew on the eve of Israeli Independence

Cory Mills says he is going to file articles of impeachment against Joe Biden over the president's decision to withhold munitions from Israel.\n\nBiden said Wednesday that he would not send some weapons to Israel if the country moves forward with an invasion of Rafah, a densely populated city in southern Gaza. The announcement infuriated many supporters of Israel, including congressional Republicans like Mills.\n\n\"(Biden is) threatening our ally Israel after funding approvals in Congress if they do not stop operations to target Hamas,\" Mills posted to X Wednesday. \"These types of actions are what President Trump was accused of and impeached over by Democrats. They called it 'Quid Pro Quo.'\" Mills added that perhaps the phrase should be renamed \"Quid Pro Joe.\"\n\nThe decision by Mills, a first-term U.S. representative whose district includes Seminole and parts of Volusia counties, was first reported by Fox News. A call to Mills' congressional office requesting comment was not immediately returned Thursday evening.\n\nDemocrats moved to impeach Donald Trump in 2019 when he was president for allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden -- then a potential political opponent. Trump withheld nearly $400 million in aid from Ukraine on the condition that officials in that country investigate Biden, Democrats alleged. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, said withholding the money violated the law.\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Trump, but the U.S. Senate did not vote to convict him.\n\nMills is alleging that Biden's withholding of certain weapons in exchange for Israel changing its military tactics constitutes a quid pro quo, according to a draft of the impeachment resolution that Mills said he plans to file to House attorneys on Friday.\n\nAdministration officials have argued that Israel conducting a widespread bombing campaign in Rafah, in which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering, would do little to advance Israel's goal of destroying Hamas.\n\n\"Smashing into Rafah, in (Biden's) view, will not advance that objective, will not get to that sustainable and enduring defeat of Hamas,\" White House spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday, according to the New York Times.\n\nEarlier this week, officials said they would hold off on sending 3,500 bombs to America's ally in the Middle East. With or without the munitions being held back by the Biden administration, Israel will likely have enough weapons to invade Rafah, the New York Times reported.\n\nMore than 34,000 people have died in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas last fall. The campaign came in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that left nearly 1,200 dead and hundreds more captured as hostages.", "source": {"uri": "tampabay.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Cory Mills (R-FL) told Fox News Digital he intends to draft impeachment articles against Joe Biden for refusing to deliver congressionally approved aid to Israel.\n\nMills argued it's a similar scenario when the Democrat-controlled House impeached President Trump in 2019.\n\n\"The House has no choice but to impeach President 'Quid pro Joe' Biden. As Vice President, Biden was caught threatening to withhold funding and aid to Ukraine unless they fired the attorney general investigating Burisma, a company financially benefiting his son Hunter, not to mention the 10% share for 'the big guy' himself,\" Mills said in a statement, according to Fox News.\n\n\"Now, Joe Biden is pressuring Israel, our biggest ally in the Middle East, by pausing their funding that has already been approved in the House, if they don't stop all operations with Hamas. It's a very clear message, 'this for that,'\" he added.\n\n\"Mills charged Biden with pressuring Israel into a 'quid pro quo' scenario by using U.S. financial support as leverage over Israeli policies in Gaza. He compared this to the Democrats' initial impeachment of former President Trump, which centered on accusations of manipulating aid to Ukraine,\" Chuck Callesto wrote.\n\nPer Fox News:\n\n\"These are the same accusations made against President Trump, which resulted in his impeachment by Democrats. The same must happen for Joe Biden, which is why we're drawing up articles of impeachment now,\" Mills finished.\n\nBiden made the high-stakes ultimatum to Israel's government in a CNN interview that aired Wednesday night as it prepares for a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The city is currently home to more than a million Palestinians who left other parts of the Gaza Strip, where Israel has conducted its mission to eradicate the terrorist group Hamas.\n\nBiden said Israel would continue to see U.S. support for its defensive systems, like the Iron Dome, in the CNN interview. He added, however, that \"if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden withheld Congressionally appropriated aid to uproot Hamas in a political pay off pro-Hamas radicals.

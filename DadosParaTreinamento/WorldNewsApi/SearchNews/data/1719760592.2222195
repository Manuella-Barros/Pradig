{"id": 225006122, "title": "Securing Edge Devices: Tech Experts Detail Risks And Challenges", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin getty Cybersecurity is a concern and watchword for organizations across industries, professionals of all stripes and even consumers, as digital devices continue to play a growing role in how we carry out a range of workplace and personal activities. As challenging as it can be for a business to secure its on-premises devices and networks, however, managing security is becoming even more difficult with the rise of interconnected edge devices, from Internet of Things equipment to the computers remote workers use. Although they can offer significant speed, efficiency, convenience and productivity benefits, edge devices are also creating new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities that organizations must address. Below, 17 members of Forbes Technology Council weigh in on some of the unique challenges stemming from the rise of connected edge devices and how organizations can effectively mitigate the associated threats. 1. Losing Control Over Sensitive Data Businesses that use popular cloud storage services such as Google Drive risk losing control over sensitive data. Employees often upload confidential information without approval, creating shared links that are accessible to anyone. Misconfigurations stem from user negligence or lack of understanding. Mitigation involves clear usage policies, education, monitoring and having guidelines for data sharing with vendors. - Mohan Koo, DTEX Systems 2. Defending A Larger Attack Surface Edge devices result in an enlarged attack surface, which makes it harder to protect against unauthorized access and cyberattacks. They often operate outside traditional security perimeters, making them more vulnerable to attacks. Strategies to address this include segmenting networks, establishing enhanced device authorization, keeping up with regular updates and patch management, ensuring continuous monitoring and anomaly detection, and having robust physical security. - Sunil Sankaramanchi, Wenable Inc.

Ensuring Security Alignment Across The Entire Network Edge and network designers need a clear understanding of security threats and agreed-upon countermeasures. Edge devices bridge the cloud or central servers and endpoints, so security must cover both. If edge devices hold less important data, security can lean toward endpoints. But more robust, high-level security is necessary if they work with vital data. Alignment across the entire network is key. - Tim Reed, Lynx Software Technologies 4. Keeping Track Of Everything On Your Network Inventory is the foundation of both the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and CIS Critical Security Controls. It sounds so easy, but as everything becomes connected, it gets pretty complicated to keep track of everything on your network and keep it all up to date with respect to security updates. You can\u2019t protect what you don\u2019t know about, so be sure to scan your network for devices, software and vulnerabilities. - Ann Westerheim, Ekaru 5. Ensuring Software Updates In Edge Devices Update availability is one of the most significant issues when it comes to edge devices. Device manufacturers create many industrial, small office and home office devices without any experience in software. Thus, they see the software as \u201cready\u201d once they ship the device, and they seldom update it afterward. We need to start building an understanding that software in a connected device is software that requires security updates. - Kevin Korte, Univention 6. Preventing The Spread Of Infection When A Device Is Compromised As interconnectivity between edge devices has grown, so has the opportunity for widespread infection of devices within a business. If one device gets compromised, all the adjacent devices then become exposed on their \u201cinternal\u201d interfaces. Network segmentation can be deployed to force edge devices to securely communicate with each other through a central management system over encrypted channels. - Carlos Morales, Vercara 7. Establishing Effective Home And Bring-Your-Own-Device Policies It\u2019s essential to create policies for devices that are brought to work, remote workers, applications and home networks. Home networks and mobile devices present an even greater threat. Appliances, TVs, games, social media, and friends and family can contaminate home networks. If employees do not practice segmentation and good network hygiene on their home networks, it is an exposure incident waiting to happen. - Leigh White, Myriad Advisor Solutions 8. Protecting Against DDoS Attacks The rise of edge devices creates new targets for distributed denial-of-service attacks, which can disrupt business operations. Organizations can combat this by deploying DDoS protection systems that mitigate attacks closer to the source and ensure continuity of service. These systems, combined with machine learning algorithms, can adapt to traffic patterns and identify anomalies quickly to prevent or lessen the impact of attacks. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech 9. Addressing Edge Devices\u2019 Limited Security And Direct Internet Exposure Cyberattacks are a growing problem due to edge devices\u2019 often limited security features and direct exposure to the internet. Organizations can address this challenge effectively by implementing robust security measures such as network segmentation, encryption, regular security updates and secure communication protocols to protect data transmitted between edge devices and the central network. - Paul Kovalenko, Langate Software 10. Gaining Visibility Into And Control Over Decentralized Networks As the interconnectivity of edge devices grows, so does the complexity of security threats. The lack of visibility and control over these decentralized networks makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Organizations should prioritize continuous and automated security assessments. AI can simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in real time, which helps you maintain a comprehensive defense. - Kirimgeray Kirimli, Flatiron Software Corporation 11. Establishing An Adaptive Security Framework To secure interconnected edge devices, an adaptive security framework is essential. It combines advanced threat detection, machine learning for anomaly spotting, robust encryption and a culture of security awareness. Maintaining an updated inventory ensures resilience against evolving threats, protecting the ecosystem\u2019s integrity. - Roman Vinogradov, Improvado 12. Accounting For Inherent Insecurities In Edge Software A critical yet often overlooked issue is the security of software on edge devices, which typically use open-source components and outdated firmware, making them easy targets for attackers. Key defenses include rigorous testing of open-source components; implementing code signing, software bill of materials and provenance verification; and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities. - Aviv Mussinger, Kodem 13. Moving Authentication Away From The Edge As organizations become increasingly interconnected at the perimeter, their attack surface increases, adding another potential point of compromise to the environment. Organizations can adopt a zero-trust architecture as a mitigation strategy. With zero trust, authentication moves away from the edge, as devices authenticate as they access resources, regardless of where they are in the network. - Kim Bozzella, Protiviti 14. Protecting Devices In Less Physically Secure Environments The big concern with edge devices is that they often function in environments without the same level of physical security as data centers, which makes them susceptible to tampering or theft. If you want to counteract this, consider deploying tamper-resistant hardware and local encryption for sensitive data. You\u2019ll also want to educate your team on the risks associated with edge devices. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster 15. Preventing Interception Or Disruption Of Communications For space applications, securing satellite communications against interception or disruption is vital. Organizations can address this by implementing robust encryption protocols and continuous security updates to safeguard data integrity. This ensures a secure network, vital for critical space communications and telemetry systems. - Shelli Brunswick, SB Global LLC 16. Keeping Up With Security Audits With the surge in edge devices, traditional security audits struggle to keep pace. I recommend implementing continuous, automated security assessments using AI to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in real time, thus maintaining a robust defense even as device ecosystems grow. - Gergo Vari, Lensa, Inc. 17. Implementing Fail-Safe Mechanisms Simply put, with edge devices, the chance of a breach is higher. A simple error can lead to compromised credentials or malware. This means that companies need fail-safe mechanisms. When it comes to data, that means the data is encrypted and the key is kept in a separate location. A breach would have to compromise both the data store and the key store to make an impact. If both of those things happen, you\u2019ve got bigger problems. - Ameesh Divatia, Baffle, Inc.

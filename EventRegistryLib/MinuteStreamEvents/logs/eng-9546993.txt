Fever to...", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd that believes the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\nYes, a little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nIndiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) and head coach Christine Sides, center right, react after a play during the second half of an WNBA basketball game against the Dallas Wings in Arlington, Texas, Friday, May 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth)\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available - only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full capacity arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there, but like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on. I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\n\nFILE - Iowa's Caitlin Clark, left, poses for a photo with WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert, right, after being selected first overall by the Indiana Fever during the first round of the WNBA basketball draft, April 15, 2024, in New York.

TV channel, streaming options & more explored", "body": "The Atlanta Dream vs Indiana Fever are one of two preseason matchups on the WNBA slate tonight. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. While the matchup won't be aired on television, there is still one way to tune into the action.\n\nSimilar to the NBA, the WNBA has their own version of league pass. They will be running a free preview tonight for fans that want to watch the Atlanta Dream take on the Indiana Fever.\n\nThis matchup has caught the attention of fans due to Caitlin Clark expected to be in action. The No. 1 pick made her preseason debut last week, and tallied 21 points in a three-point loss for the Fever. Thursday's matchup will be Clark's final chance to get game reps before making her official WNBA debut.\n\nFor those wanting to stream the game, it can be done so on the WNBA app. While they are running a free preview at the moment, it is something they typically charge for. A full-season subscription of WNBA league pass costs $34.99, or fans can pay monthly for $12.99.\n\nCaitlin Clark speaks on expectations for Indiana Fever's first home game\n\nAfter opening the preseason on the road, the Indiana Fever get the opportunity to close things out in front of their home fans. This is a big event, as it will be the first time Caitlin Clark performs in front of the Indiana faithful.\n\nExpectations will be high for the Fever crowd, as the team's last preseason game was in front of a sellout crowd. When asked about playing at home for the first time, Clark said she is expecting a great atmosphere.\n\n\"I'm expecting it be loud, I'm expecting fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"They're invested in the basketball, they want to support women's basketball.\"\n\nIt's been eight years since the Indiana Fever finished a season above .500.

Throughout this series, she was a guest on our show, the Monday night show, last year. She's a Chiefs fan - I forgive her for that - but she said she did grow up kind of watching me play, and she's going to love Indianapolis.

The 6-0 guard dominated college hoops at Iowa prior to the Indiana Fever selecting her with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft.\n\nAside from breaking college basketball's all-time scoring record, Clark advanced women's basketball to a new stage with millions of new fans. Her popularity is expected to keep rising as she starts her professional career.\n\nThat career is coming soon, too. Fans have already gotten a taste of Clark and the Fever in the preseason, but it's almost time for the real deal. The Sporting News details Clark's schedule, including key matchups throughout her rookie season.\n\nMORE: Best reactions to Caitlin Clark's WNBA preseason debut\n\nClark will make her WNBA debut on Tuesday, May 14 against the Connecticut Sun on the road. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nShe made her preseason debut against the Dallas Wings on Friday, May 3. She scored 21 points on five 3-pointers, but the Fever lost on a game-winning bucket from Arike Ogunbowale.\n\nClark and Angel Reese cemented their rivalry in the 2023 national championship game. Reese, a former LSU forward, helped the Tigers defeat the Hawkeyes 102-85.\n\nNot only were they some of the game's brightest stars, but Reese added fuel to the fire when she taunted Clark as the game was expiring. Reese was the No. 2 prospect in the 2020 high school class, while Clark was the No. 4.\n\nReese and Clark met again in 2024 Elite Eight, and the current Chicago Sky forward clarified that the two \"don't hate each other.\"\n\nThe two will face off again when the Fever host the Sky on Saturday, June 1 at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nBUY NOW: Cheapest tickets to see Fever vs. Sky on StubHub\n\nAnother featured matchup for Clark will be against Diana Taurasi and the Phoenix Mercury. The Mercury will host the Fever on Sunday, June 30 at 3 p.m. ET\n\nThe No. 1 pick of the 2004 draft is entering her 20th WNBA season, still churning out All-Star caliber numbers.\n\nShe made headlines when she said the WNBA won't be a cakewalk for Clark. Naturally, fans didn't take this lightly and bombarded the former UConn standout with displeasure. Clark hasn't responded publicly.\n\nClark will get an early taste of the reigning back-to-back WNBA champions Aces when the Fever visit Las Vegas on Saturday, May 25 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nA'ja Wilson and Kelsey Plum headline the Aces' roster, but the matchup would be even more interesting if Kate Martin makes the roster.

The only thing that matters at the end of the season is wins and losses. Plenty of teams in every sport are projected to have incredible seasons, only to flounder off to the middle or bottom of the pack. It happens in football, baseball, NBA basketball, etc. At the end of the day, power rankings don't mean a da** thing.\n\nIt's still exciting to see how much optimism one of Iowa's favorite athletes is already bringing to her new team. ESPN's Michael Voepel believes the developing chemistry between Caitlin Clark, Aliyah Boston, and NaLyssa Smith could help lead the Fever back to the WNBA playoffs, which should be the goal for the Indiana Fever. He told Yahoo Sports\n\n\"Will this be the season the Fever make it back to the playoffs? That's the primary goal for Indiana after adding Caitlin Clark to go along with last year's number 1 pick, forward Aliyah Boston, and 2022's number 2 selection, forward NaLyssa Smith. Clark had 21 points in Fever's exhibition opener and looked comfortable in her first pro appearance. The developing chemistry between her and the young posts is something to watch.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark received plenty of attention during her time at the University of Iowa. Now that she's playing against other professional athletes, you can bet the Indiana Fever basketball team will be followed more closely than ever before.\n\nWill the Indiana Fever continue to climb the WNBA power rankings? If Caitlin looks as comfortable as she did in her first taste of professional sports, you can imagine the Fever is in for an exciting new era of basketball.", "source": {"uri": "kdat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "104.5 KDAT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/726/files/2024/05/attachment-GettyImages-2151504819.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 64, "textEnd": 69}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1146, "textEnd": 1154}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFamily Resources in Davenport to lay off 26 Two dead after shooting in Moline Sunday, police ask public for photo, video evidence Woman gives CPR after shooting in East Moline, police chief confirms one dead Officials identify two people shot and killed Sunday in Moline A violent Sunday leaves one dead in East Moline, two killed in Moline Alabama man arrested in relation to killing in East Moline, victim identified Muscatine furry discusses lifestyle, social media posts Davenport man faces three felony charges for allegedly defrauding multiple area banks Davenport collapse lawsuits: City files appeal to Iowa Supreme Court Davenport man was under surveillance, subject of investigation before he was killed Davenport businesses sue city, HESCO over 2019 flood losses Two killed in separate crashes Wednesday in East Moline Unidentified company considering Davenport for $800 million data center Davenport Learning Center to re-launch programming for alternative education, IEP students Teens killed in Moline Sunday were friends, both fondly remembered\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there. But like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on.\n\n\"I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\nPhotos: Caitlin Clark on the WNBA Fever\n\nWNBA Fever Clark Basketball\n\nWNBA Fever Clark Basketball\n\nWNBA Fever Clark Basketball\n\nWNBA Fever Clark Basketball\n\nWNBA Fever Clark Basketball\n\nWNBA Fever Clark Basketball\n\nClark\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tickets for the Indiana Fever's opening regular-season matchup against the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday are selling quickly. You should budget for a significant amount of money if you intend to attend Caitlin Clark's WNBA regular season debut.\n\nStarting in 2024, Clark and her Indiana Fever will play the Connecticut Sun in Mohegan Sun Arena. Based on the cost of tickets, it appears that \"The Caitlin Clark Effect\" is still very much in effect.\n\nHowever, that should not discourage you as some cheap tickets are still available.\n\nAccording to SeatGeek, the cheapest tickets to see Clark's debut will run you about $95, which isn't that bad considering the hype around Caitlin Clark.\n\nThe total cost of a ticket is $300 on average. The Fever-Sun has several portions offered for between $260 and $320. A ticket would cost you at least $1,700 if you wanted to sit courtside.\n\nIn addition to shattering the all-time scoring record in college basketball, Clark brought women's basketball to a new level and attracted millions of new supporters. It's anticipated that once she begins her professional career, her popularity will only grow.\n\nOne could argue that, out of all the major sports, her debut is among the most awaited of the last few years. Prior to the Indiana Fever picking her with the first overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft, the talented guard dominated collegiate hoops at Iowa.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 14, Clark will play her first WNBA game away from home against the Connecticut Sun. The game is set to begin at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Former NFL WR Antonio Brown Opens Up About His Beef With Caitlin Clark, Issues Heartfelt Statement Before Taking One Brutal Final Shot At Her Private Parts\n\nOn Friday, May 3, she made her preseason debut against the Dallas Wings.

And the regular season doesn't begin until May 14.\n\n\"Full Court Press,\" a four-part documentary series produced in part by former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning and detailing the WNBA draft journey for Clark, South Carolina's Kamilla Cardoso and UCLA's Kiki Rice, will debut Saturday on ABC.\n\nAnd Disney+ announced Tuesday it will stream the Fever's regular-season opener at the Connecticut Sun, the first live sports event ever to stream on the service.\n\nWelcome to the \"Caitlin Clark Effect,\" which makes the first of at least 21 stops in Indianapolis on Thursday.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" Fever forward Aliyah Boston, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 WNBA Draft, said of the excitement surrounding Clark's home debut. \"So it's really exciting that everyone is tuning in, especially (for) the league. I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's how we continue to grow.\"\n\nWhile the spotlight continues to grow off the court, Indiana's focus is squarely on making its first postseason appearance since 2016.\n\nHead coach Christie Sides has preached attention to detail in that pursuit.\n\nShe believes the preseason debut at Dallas - a 79-76 loss in which Clark led the team with 21 points and made five 3-pointers - was a good first step, and she's looking to smooth out more of the rough edges against the Dream.\n\nSides compared the atmosphere in Dallas to the WNBA Finals and said another near-capacity crowd will be welcome.\n\n\"It's great for our game,\" she said. \"It's great for our league. It's great for these players. But that was kind of the one thing that I've been trying to preach since Day 1 of training camp. We can't get ahead of ourselves.\n\n\"We're gonna figure out rotations. We're gonna play different lineups. That's what preseason games are for. So that's what we did against Dallas. We've gotta see all of them that are out here (on the preseason roster). So the game tomorrow, it'll be the same - few tweaks. We'll play differently than we did against Dallas, but (the message is) if you're in, you play as hard as you can and do the best that you can, and the outcome will be what it is. We're planning for (May 14) against Connecticut.\"\n\nThe Fever are kicking off a major sports weekend in Indy.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series Friday, the Sonsio Grand Prix takes place Saturday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Pacers return home Sunday for Game 4.\n\nThere's an energy throughout the city, and Clark is proud to be a part of it.\n\n\"I'm going to the game on Friday,\" Clark said. \"I'll be over there cheering. So I think it's a great time for the city of Indianapolis. I think the hype around the Fever, the Pacers, whatever it is - two really great organizations that are really investing and wanting to make it really good.\n\n\"And I've been following the Pacers all year long, so getting to see what they've been doing is pretty special.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full capacity arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there, but like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on. I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_marot@eagletribune.com", "name": "Michael Marot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/fc/6fcee591-828c-5ec7-a3aa-b3f12dc09b1b/663c15b1164cb.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1423, "textEnd": 1429}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The NCAA phenom left the Iowa Hawkeyes as the highest scorer in NCAA history and was selected No. 1 overall by the Indiana Fever in the 2024 WNBA Draft.\n\nEven before she was drafted, she was the subject of tons of sports stories, and it was clear that her stardom was undeniable. WNBA teams began to proactively move their showdowns with the Fever to bigger stadiums in preparation for Clark's arrival, assuming it would lead to sold-out crowds.\n\nOne of the first teams to do this was the Las Vegas Aces, who moved from the 12,000-capacity Michelob ULTRA Arena in Las Vegas to the 20,000-capacity T-Mobile Arena. The Los Angeles Sparks are also moving their games with Fever to the Crypto.com arena to prepare for the bigger crowds that want to see Clark in action. Tickets for some games the Fever will play are insanely high heading into the season.\n\nShortly after Clark was drafted, she also was the source of a bidding war with a multitude of athletic wear companies. Ultimately, she signed a Nike deal worth up to $28 million, which includes a signature shoe.\n\nEveryone can see the massive impact that Clark has had on the game of basketball and she continues to showcase a popularity that has not been seen before in women's sports. Now, her WNBA debut will make history with Disney+.\n\nDisney+ will be debuting the season opener for the Indiana Fever on Tuesday when the regular season for the WNBA begins, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Fans who cannot attend the game will at least be able to see Clark in action from the comfort of their homes.\n\nThis is the first time that Disney+ has ever offered a live sporting event, and what a perfect event for the streaming service to showcase. Clark serves as a massive role model for young hopeful basketball players around the world, and what better way to showcase passion and dedication than her debut being displayed to the world on a family-friendly streaming platform?\n\nThe WNBA is in the midst of the preseason, as the Fever took on the Dallas Wings on Friday, losing with a final score of 79-76.

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nIt seems like we only just saw Caitlin Clark competing for the women's national championship ... and that's because we did. And yet, we're just under a week away from the 2024 WNBA season starting -- with the Indiana Fever No. 1 overall pick getting ready to make her professional debut.\n\nSportsbooks are offering bets for Clark and the Indiana Fever this season, so let's take a look at the best ones out there and what we like for arguably the greatest women's college basketball player of all-time.\n\nREAD: How to bet futuresREAD: Updated 2024 NBA Finals odds Caitlin Clark WNBA rookie season props: 22+ points per game (-120 or better)\n\nA two-time national player of the year, Clark was drafted No. 1 overall by the Indiana Fever and is ready for her first game on May 14.\n\nThe NCAA all-time leading scorer averaged 28.4 points per game in her career and 31.6 as a senior. The WNBA will be an adjustment for Clark, but it shouldn't take long for her to make the necessary changes and start scoring at will again.\n\nWhile she'll continue to be a passing threat with Kelsey Mitchell, NaLyssa Smith and Aliyah Boston also on the floor with her, expect Clark to score 22+ a game for the season.\n\nCaitlin Clark 2024 WNBA season best bet: Make 1+ 3-pointers in every game played (+100 or better)\n\nAlso the NCAAW all-time leader in 3-pointers made, Clark became known for her long range shooting and was compared to Steph Curry throughout her career.\n\nWith the physicality of the WNBA up a notch from women's college ball, scoring in the paint could be a bit more difficult at times for Clark. But shooting from anywhere outside the 3-point arc should remain and easy task for her -- both while she's open and being defended tightly.\n\nClark made at least one 3-pointer in all but one game during her four-year career at Iowa and had at least two in every game as a senior.\n\nGetting this at plus-money seems like a steal.\n\n2024 WNBA Finals long shot odds: Indiana Fever (+2500 or better)\n\nDespite getting the No. 1 pick in the draft, the Fever only had the third-worst record in the league last season. The pairing of Clark with Boston -- the 2023 No. 1 overall pick -- could be significant in springing them into playoff contention.\n\nThe Aces (+100 or better) and Liberty (+230 or better) are atop the odds boards, with the Storm and Sun next closest teams with four-digit odds.\n\nIt's quite a long shot, but it would seem like destiny to see Clark lead the Fever to the WNBA title as a rookie after falling in the women's national championship in her final two seasons in college.\n\n2024 WNBA playoff: Underdog DFS promo code BETFPB for basketball prop betting\n\nSome legal betting states do allow WNBA prop betting, but it's much more widespread at a DFS site such as Underdog, which offers $100 guaranteed bonus when registering with our Underdog WNBA promo code BETFPB when signing up.\n\nUnderdog DFS allows you to choose Higher or Lower on WNBA props, similar to an over/under.

Fever to open arena's 3rd deck", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd that believes the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\nYes, a little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full capacity arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there, but like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on. I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_marot@hjnews.com", "name": "Michael Marot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/hjnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/60/b60461d3-6970-54c8-98f1-b2ffaf5b6c1f/6639f317979dc.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1188, "textEnd": 1194}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nIt seems like we only just saw Caitlin Clark competing for the women's national championship ... and that's because we did. And yet, we're just under a week away from the 2024 WNBA season starting -- with the Indiana Fever No. 1 overall pick getting ready to make her professional debut.\n\nSportsbooks are offering bets for Clark and the Indiana Fever this season, so let's take a look at the best ones out there and what we like for arguably the greatest women's college basketball player of all-time.\n\nREAD: How to bet futuresREAD: Updated 2024 NBA Finals odds\n\nCaitlin Clark WNBA rookie season props: 22+ points per game (-120 or better)\n\nA two-time national player of the year, Clark was drafted No. 1 overall by the Indiana Fever and is ready for her first game on May 14.\n\nThe NCAA all-time leading scorer averaged 28.4 points per game in her career and 31.6 as a senior. The WNBA will be an adjustment for Clark, but it shouldn't take long for her to make the necessary changes and start scoring at will again.\n\nWhile she'll continue to be a passing threat with Kelsey Mitchell, NaLyssa Smith and Aliyah Boston also on the floor with her, expect Clark to score 22+ a game for the season.\n\nCaitlin Clark 2024 WNBA season best bet: Make 1+ 3-pointers in every game played (+100 or better)\n\nAlso the NCAAW all-time leader in 3-pointers made, Clark became known for her long range shooting and was compared to Steph Curry throughout her career.\n\nWith the physicality of the WNBA up a notch from women's college ball, scoring in the paint could be a bit more difficult at times for Clark. But shooting from anywhere outside the 3-point arc should remain and easy task for her -- both while she's open and being defended tightly.\n\nClark made at least one 3-pointer in all but one game during her four-year career at Iowa and had at least two in every game as a senior.\n\nGetting this at plus-money seems like a steal.\n\n2024 WNBA Finals long shot odds: Indiana Fever (+2500 or better)\n\nDespite getting the No. 1 pick in the draft, the Fever only had the third-worst record in the league last season. The pairing of Clark with Boston -- the 2023 No. 1 overall pick -- could be significant in springing them into playoff contention.\n\nThe Aces (+100 or better) and Liberty (+230 or better) are atop the odds boards, with the Storm and Sun next closest teams with four-digit odds.\n\nIt's quite a long shot, but it would seem like destiny to see Clark lead the Fever to the WNBA title as a rookie after falling in the women's national championship in her final two seasons in college.\n\n2024 WNBA playoff: Underdog DFS promo code BETFPB for basketball prop betting\n\nSome legal betting states do allow WNBA prop betting, but it's much more widespread at a DFS site such as Underdog, which offers $100 guaranteed bonus when registering with our Underdog WNBA promo code BETFPB when signing up.\n\nUnderdog DFS allows you to choose Higher or Lower on WNBA props, similar to an over/under.

Caitlin Clark's boyfriend Connor McCaffery has cruel response to fan who wants to marry her\n\nCaitlin Clark's competitive debut in the WNBA is mere days away, and the Indiana Fever's newest star is already lighting up opponents in preseason action -- generating even more hype and excitement about what lies ahead for the #1 overall pick.\n\nIt's no secret that Clark has put a charge into the WNBA as the league enters a new chapter in its 27-year existence. Former star athletes in the state of Indiana are also highlighting her burgeoning impact in the community already. Former Pacers sharpshooter Reggie Miller is one of them, and Indianapolis Colts legend Peyton Manning just became another.\n\nManning produced the \"Full Court Press\" docuseries that tracked Clark and other women's basketball players during the 2023/24 season, and after it premiered, he said that Clark was going to fall in love with Indianapolis -- where Manning starred for the Colts between 1998 and 2010, bringing home a Super Bowl title in 2006.\n\n\"It's a great place for her to play,\" Manning said. \"I'm looking forward to watching her.\"\n\nClark is expected to transform the Fever from a WNBA doormat into a contender -- but it might not happen overnight. The process will have to play out as Clark finds chemistry with 2023 #1 pick Aliyah Boston, while star shooting guard Kelsey Mitchell is on the mend from an ankle injury that cost her the start of training camp last month.\n\nNevertheless, all eyes will be on Clark as she tries to take her prodigious scoring ability from the NCAA into the WNBA. The former Iowa Hawkeye's preseason debut on Friday saw her score 21 points and demonstrate some of the fiery passion that defined her college tenure -- and, in Manning's eyes, will make her so much fun to watch.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/2150a89938cf39d813736c5e1ee392dc/crop/0x0/1978x1318/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/08/17151886858610.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

She'll have one more tune-up against the Atlanta Dream tomorrow before the games start to count for real.\n\nAs basketball fans, we're pumped to finally see Clark on the WNBA stage, and we'll be following her throughout the Fever's 40-game regular season and hopefully into the playoffs.\n\nLooking ahead, there are a few regular season matchups that appear juicier than others, so here's the five Caitlin Clark games we're most looking forward to.\n\nVs. New York Liberty (May 16)\n\nThis will be Clark's second WNBA game after she and the Fever travel to the Connecticut Sun for the season opener on May 14. What makes this significant is that it'll be her first game in front of the Fever home crowd, who have gone out of their way to embrace the former Iowa star from the moment Indiana won the WNBA Draft lottery.\n\nAt New York Liberty (May 18)\n\nA second game against the Liberty? Okay, maybe there's some New York/East Coast bias here, but we're talking about the WNBA runner-up and a franchise that's loaded with star power with Jonquel Jones, Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, Courtney Vandersloot and more.\n\nThis will also be Clark's first time playing in New York, and like the song says, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.\n\nAt Las Vegas Aces (May 25)\n\nClark and the Fever vs. the defending WNBA champs. Las Vegas is stacked, led by superstar A'ja Wilson and the formidable backcourt of Chelsea Gray, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young. Former Iowa star Megan Gustafson and Clark's Hawkeye teammate Kate Martin are also on the Aces' camp roster, and it would be awesome if one or both are still around for this showdown.\n\nVs. Chicago Sky (June 1)\n\nAn old-fashioned Midwestern clash, this game will feature Clark renewing her college rivalry with Angel Reese. We're not sure if South Carolina alum Kamilla Cardoso, the No. 3 overall pick and MOP of the 2024 Women's Final Four, will be back from her shoulder injury by this point, but it would add another layer to this already-intriguing game if she were.\n\nAt Phoenix Mercury (June 30)\n\nThe first of two meetings between the Fever and Mercury, the temperature will surely be turned up for this one, pun intended. That's because we'll get to see Clark go head-to-head with the legendary Diana Taurasi, who famously (infamously?) warned the No. 1 overall pick that the transition to the professional level won't be an easy one.\n\nClark will have plenty of games under her belt by the time this matchup rolls around, and we can't wait for it.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Fever to open arena's 3rd deck vs Atlanta", "body": "By MICHAEL MAROT - AP Sports Writer\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd of 17,000 that believe the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\nA little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there. But like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on.\n\n\"I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball", "source": {"uri": "muscatinejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Muscatine Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/e6/3e68dd86-3306-5435-b684-bb47e82a7d6f/663cee7fa7e8c.preview.jpg?crop=1653%2C868%2C14%2C54&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1229, "textEnd": 1235}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It would be silly to limit that at the next level. Her shot range and ballhandling are keys to manipulating defenses to get teammates open looks. I think that translates, too. It wouldn't shock me if she averaged around eight assists per game her rookie year.\"\n\nClark made a major impact during her time with the Iowa Hawkeyes.

The college star who has transformed women's basketball", "body": "The \"Caitlin Clark Effect\", as it has been known, has transformed women's basketball forever in terms of viewing ratings, attendance, merchandise and off-the-court endorsement deals.\n\nCaitlin Clark has propelled women's basketball into a new space, becoming an icon for the sport, while leaving a lasting imprint throughout American society and culture - all by the age of 22.\n\nClark, from West Des Moines, Iowa, made her college debut for the Iowa Hawkeyes in 2020 and was drafted #1 overall in the WNBA Draft by the Indiana Fever last month.\n\nIn the last four years, she has been immortalised as the greatest scorer in college basketball history, racking up 3,951 points across four seasons.\n\nIn March, she passed basketball great Pete Maravich for the all-time National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) points record, held for more than half a century.\n\nClark's playing style has been notably compared to NBA superstar Stephen Curry, while inspiring a whole new generation of basketball fans across the globe.\n\nThe \"Caitlin Clark Effect\", as it has been known, has transformed women's basketball forever. Here's how she has achieved it.\n\nThis year's Iowa-South Carolina national championship game averaged 18.9 million viewers, up 89% on the year before - making it the highest-rated basketball game in five years, men's or women's, at any level. South Carolina won the game 87-75.\n\nAt its peak, the match was being viewed by 24 million people across America.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the 2023 WNBA Finals averaged 728,000 viewers over four games - with 889,000 tuning in to witness the Las Vegas Aces' championship win.\n\nOf the 12 WNBA teams, the Indiana Fever had the second-lowest attendance in 2023, with the Fever only playing on TV once.\n\nAccording to Vivid Seats, average ticket prices of games including the Fever have more than doubled, all before she got drafted.\n\nAt least 36 of the Fever's 40 regular season games are to be shown on TV and streaming platforms - the most in the WNBA.\n\nIn April, Clark was selected No 1 overall by the Indiana Fever at the WNBA Draft, drawing an average of 2.45 million viewers.\n\nThis marks a 307% increase in viewership over the 2023 edition, which drew only 572,000 viewers.\n\nThe previous WNBA Draft ratings record was set in 2004, being viewed by 600,000 people.\n\nSports retailer Fanatics says Clark's #22 jersey for the Fever also became an instant hit, becoming the top-selling jersey ever for a draft pick in any sport. This record was later broken by Caleb Williams after the Chicago Bears drafted him #1 overall in the NFL Draft.\n\nAll before turning pro, the 22-year-old has signed lucrative endorsement deals with Nike, Gatorade, State Farm and Panini - something that was previously in breach of NCAA regulations until 2021.\n\nName, Image, Likeness database On3 says Clark has made $3.1m (\u00a32.4m) from sponsorships in college.\n\nAt the draft, Clark became the first basketball star - WNBA or\u202fNBA - to be dressed by Prada.\n\nClark has reportedly signed an eight-year $28m (\u00a322.4m) contract with Nike, including her own signature shoe.\n\nThe #1 pick also made a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, racking up millions of views on social media.\n\nClark is set to earn a salary of $76,535 (\u00a361,384) for her rookie season.\n\nAccording to the\u202fWNBA's\u202fCollective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Clark will earn $338,056 (\u00a3271,141) over the next four years.\n\nIn contrast, last year's No. 1 NBA Draft pick - Victor Wembanyama - signed a $55m four-year deal with the San Antonio Spurs, according to sports contract tracker Spotrac.\n\nClark's earnings on the court are only 0.6% of Wembanyama's first NBA contract.\n\nFollowing the draft, US President Joe Biden spoke out on the overall state of salaries in women's sports, posting on X that female athletes were \"not paid their fair share\".\n\nThe Iowa legend has increased viewing ratings, attendance, and merchandise sales to unprecedented heights.\n\nOff the court, her star power has opened burgeoning financial opportunities for student-athletes, as well as for female basketball players.\n\nClark's prominence has also ignited the debate surrounding the significant inequality between male and female sporting contracts in the US. - Sky News", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fever to open arena's 3rd deck vs Atlanta", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd of 17,000 that believe the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\nA little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there. But like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on.\n\n\"I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested.

You're going up against grown women. This is how they feed their families. This is not just for the love of the [game]. This is their livelihood.\"\n\nGriner is also excited for Clark because of the impact she has already made in the league. \"The hype that Caitlin and some others have right now is amazing for the league,\" she says. \"There's good talent coming in.\"\n\nWhen looking at Griner and Clark's careers, there are some similarities. Both were No. 1 overall picks, both were named AP Player of the Year and both won their conference Player of the Year award three times. Griner was selected No. 1 overall by the Phoenix Mercury in 2013 and led the team to a championship in 2014.

Instead of loading her bag directly onto a plane and boarding, Clark found herself traversing the same lines and waits as everyone else at the Dallas airport - just like most of the league's players.\n\nIt's a hassle she wouldn't mind avoiding on future trips and now league commissioner Cathy Engelbert is working on a solution.\n\nOne day after Engelbert told a group of sports editors that she's trying to find regular charter flights for all 12 WNBA teams, Clark and her new teammates embraced the move.\n\n\"I think you just have to be aware of where you are,\" Clark said after Wednesday's practice. \"You travel with security, which is nice. It's just different from college where you put your bag on the plane, hop on the plane and then you're off. But like (here) you're waiting at baggage claim, you've got to go through the normal security with everybody else. For me, it was my first time doing it. It wasn't terrible. I just went about my business and kept my head down.\"\n\nClark went on to score 21 points in her pro debut, a 79-76 loss.\n\nCORRECTS FROM CAITLYN TO CAITLIN - Pailynn Amos, center, holds a sign for Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark in front of her mother Rebecca Amos, of Ennis, Texas, prior to an WNBA basketball game against the Dallas Wings in Arlington, Texas, Friday, May 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth)\n\nBut her star power has only fueled a debate that took center stage last season when Phoenix Suns star Brittney Griner was confronted by a man who started asking questions as she walked through an airport. The incident became so heated that the man was tackled and law enforcement was called.\n\nLeague officials called the man's actions \"inappropriate\" and \"unfortunate.\"\n\nIt spurred a leaguewide debate over player safety with some veteran stars asking that league officials do more, including charter flights. And now, with one of the most heralded rookie classes entering the league, Engelbert wants to take action even if she doesn't have a defined timetable for when it could happen.\n\nFever coach Christie Sides also remembered sleeping in an airport while working with the Chicago Sky because of several delays before the flight was eventually canceled. She said the team took a 6 a.m. flight and played later that night.\n\nFor those reasons, it can't start soon enough for those who have been around the league for years - or for Clark, who has been driving WNBA ticket sales upward after spending her last two seasons at Iowa driving a substantial increase in television ratings.\n\n\"I'm thankful at whatever point that happens, that would be great for us. It will make recovery easier, it will make travel easier,\" Clark said. \"It just makes life a lot easier for a lot of people, but also it's just something a lot of people have deserved for years and years.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\n\nIndiana Fever's Caitlin Clark, left, gives autographs as she arrives on the Red Carpet before the world premiere and screening of Episode 1 of the upcoming ESPN+ Original Series Full Court Press, Monday, May 6, 2024, in Indianapolis.

Fever to open arena's 3rd deck", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd that believes the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nYes, a little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full capacity arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there, but like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on. I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\n___\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thepeterboroughexaminer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/2b/02b549b4-b893-5bde-880c-b65cc6bbe704/663a76e90cd23.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1282, "textEnd": 1288}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The NCAA's all-time leading scorer kept up that trend in the early stages of her WNBA career with national attention on the Fever's May 3 preseason opener against the Dallas Wings.\n\nFans can anticipate something similar on May 9 with a packed Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The Fever will host the Atlanta Dream in a preseason game that got moved from May 10 due to the Indiana Pacers' NBA playoff series against the New York Knicks.\n\nClark said she will attend that Pacers game day after the Fever home opener. Besides being a basketball enthusiast, her boyfriend, Connor McCaffery, serves as an assistant coach for the Pacers.\n\n\"It's a great time for the city of Indianapolis -- the Fever, the Pacers ... two really great organizations that are really investing and wanting to make it really good,\" Clark said during a May 8 shoot around. \"I've been following the Pacers all year long, so getting to see what they've been doing is pretty special. Hopefully they can steal one in New York before they come back here, and then I know this place will be rockin'.\"\n\nFirst, the fans will rock for Clark's first home game as a WNBA player. Clark's early impact on the Fever and WNBA has already led to sold out arenas and enhanced media coverage of the league.\n\n\"Anytime you get to play in front of your home environment, don't have to travel. Just makes things a little bit better, and obviously, it's my first time out here,\" Clark said. \"Played in this Arena before [with Iowa] but it will obviously be a little bit different, you know, wearing a Fever uniform.\"\n\n\"So more than anything, I'm just getting excited to get out there and run for the first time,\" Clark added.\n\n\"I think everybody's just, you know, positive attitude and I think acceptance, too,\" Clark said. \"Like you can really tell that everybody just wants the best for each other no matter, you know, how many minutes you play, no matter what your role is going to be on this team.\"\n\n\"I think everybody's just motivated to have a really successful season ... just wants the best,\" she added. \"That starts with the coaching staff with building a really good culture, getting the right people in the locker room. Lin's done a great job doing that. Christie's done a great job doing that. So, I would say like that's the biggest thing is like just everybody's competitive spirit but also supportiveness at the same time.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_davis@heavy.com", "name": "Matthew Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clark-2-3-e1715268608629.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 215, "textEnd": 220}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 311}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 427, "textEnd": 433}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 896, "textEnd": 901}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Clark entered the draft as the leading scorer in college basketball, men or women.\n\nHowever, after she signed the rookie contract with the Indiana Fever, the contract raised eyebrows around the sports world. She signed a four-year $338,056 rookie contract with the Fever.\n\nClark's rookie contract, which is decided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement is far less than what was expected, especially after a successful 2023 season. Clark is set to receive $76,535 in 2024. A total of 40 games will be played this season, which amounts to a per-game salary of approximately $1,913.\n\nCaitlin Clark's salary witnesses a steady increase until 2027, following which, she becomes a free agent. The following table gives the details about her yearly as well as per-game salary for each season until 2027.\n\nAccording to the CBA, all top four selections in the first round will be paid the same salary. The agreement means that Clark, Cameron Brink (LA Sparks), Kamilla Cardoso (Chicago Sky) and Rickea Jackson (LA Sparks) will be paid the same amount in their rookie contracts by their respective teams.\n\nHowever, Nike's multimillion-dollar contract that Clark signed recently will see the Indiana Fever star rookie earn $28 million from the sneaker giant. Moreover, Clark will also have her own signature shoe with Nike.\n\nCaitlin Clark and the Fever lost 79-76 to the Dallas Wings in the first of two preseason games. Clark scored 21 points on her debut.\n\nCaitlin Clark vs Victor Wenbanyama rookie salary\n\nThere's a world of difference between the salaries of NBA and the WNBA players, including rookies.\n\nCaitlin Clark's total four-year contract is far less than rookie Victor Wembanyama's yearly salary. While Wembanyama will be paid over $12 million for the 2023-24 season, Clark's total rookie contract is only $338,056.\n\nWembanyama will earn over $16 million in his final year of contract in 2027. While Clark will be paid less than $2,000 per game in her rookie year, Wembanyama will receive $148,300, highlighting the massive pay gap between the No. 1 draft picks of the men's and women's basketball leagues.\n\nThe massive difference is due to a multitude of reasons, though. One, while the NBA is an established league and running for 78 years old, the WNBA is only 28 years old.\n\nMoreover, there is also a stark difference between the revenue generated by both leagues. While the NBA generates a total revenue of over $10 billion, the WNBA generates only $200 million.\n\nAs the WNBA grows in light of the recent increase in viewership, there's hope that the pay gap will decrease in the coming years.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandjee_ranjan@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Nandjee Ranjan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/bec95-17152643078452-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

But they also have to try and be somewhat realistic. ESPN decided to eschew the realism completely in a new promo featuring the upcoming WNBA season.\n\nESPN is excited about the WNBA. They should be. There's more buzz around the league than at any time in history. That's largely due to former Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark, the number one pick in the WNBA Draft.\n\nBut in this new promo, ESPN proudly declares that the WNBA is \"the best league in the world.\" According to what metrics?\n\nNotice they didn't qualify this by saying \"best women's sports league\" or even \"best women's basketball league.\" They simply state that it's the \"best league in the world.\"\n\nIf you take into account all the various professional sports leagues in the world, the WNBA wouldn't crack the Top 25. Heck, it might not even be in the Top 50.\n\nNow, you could argue that it's implied. Maybe it is. But that's not what they said. I can't remember any other American pro sports league declaring itself the best league in the world. Except, maybe the NFL. However, in the NFL's case, that would be true.\n\nThere's an argument to be made that the WNBA isn't even the best women's basketball league in the world. It depends on the criteria. Many WNBA players play in overseas leagues because the pay and benefits are much better. Those leagues actually make a profit, which the WNBA does not.\n\nThe most-watched WNBA game IN HISTORY failed to draw 900,000 viewers. It's hard to find data on overseas television ratings, but it's certainly possible that a European women's professional basketball game had more viewers.\n\nThe other thing about the promo that struck me was how little they focused on Caitlin Clark. She doesn't appear until about halfway through the commercial. The narrator mentioned \"the best draft class in history\" and they do interlay the audio of Clark being selected #1 overall.\n\nOf the two games that they are promoting, one of them is Clark's WNBA debut against the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday night. The promo doesn't even mention that or make it clear. How is that possible?\n\nIt's because neither ESPN nor the WNBA want to overly promote Clark. That's absurd, since she's obviously the most popular player in WNBA history. There's no real debate to have about that.\n\nLook at the women's NCAA Basketball Tournament ratings when Catlin Clark played. Her Final Four matchup against UConn drew over 14 million viewers, which aired late on a Friday night. That's considered one of the worst television time slots that currently exists.\n\nThe game before Clark, between South Carolina and N.C. State, aired before Iowa's game in a slightly better timeslot. That game drew half as many viewers as Iowa-UConn.\n\nThey want to push Angel Reese as a potential star in her right, and she is. But here's the important question: would Angel Reese be who she is today without Caitlin Clark?\n\nMost people probably didn't know much about Reese until she taunted Clark after the 2023 NCAA Women's Championship. It was Clark that helped vault Reese into superstardom.\n\nWe don't know for sure if Reese would be as popular as she is right now without Clark, but an educated guess would suggest we have that answer.\n\nBut ESPN can't go all-in Clark because it is a left-wing network. The WNBA is a far-left-wing sports league. Pushing Clark over the black players in the league makes them racist, at least in their minds - and, more importantly, in the minds of the extreme leftists on social media.\n\nThe WNBA has a unique opportunity to actually produce a profit for the first time in its history.

What time is Atlanta Dream vs Indiana Fever? TV Channel and where to watch the Caitlin Clark preseason game\n\nIndiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark has quickly become a standout player in the WNBA. As she embarked on her first road trip last week, she encountered the reality of traveling as a professional basketball player. Unlike the streamlined process of boarding a plane directly with her bag in tow, she found herself navigating the lines and waits at a Dallas airport, just like her fellow players.\n\n\"It's just different from college where you put your bag on the plane, hop on the plane and then you're off. But like [here] you're waiting at baggage claim, you've got to go through the normal security with everybody else,\" Clark shared after her first experience.\n\nHowever, Clark expressed her openness to adapting to the new routine, stating, \"For me, it was my first time doing it. It wasn't terrible. I just went about my business and kept my head down.\"\n\nFollowing this experience, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has taken steps to address the challenges faced by players like Clark. She disclosed her efforts to secure regular charter flights for all 12 WNBA teams, aiming to provide a more efficient and comfortable travel experience for the players.\n\n\"I think you just have to be aware of where you are. You travel with security, which is nice,\" Clark acknowledged, highlighting the differences in the professional league's travel procedures compared to her college days.\n\nThe discussion around player safety and convenience during travel has gained momentum, particularly fueled by the star power of players like Clark. This conversation was reignited by an incident involving Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner, who was confronted by an individual at an airport, leading to a heated altercation that required law enforcement intervention.\n\nThe incident sparked a leaguewide debate over player safety, prompting veteran stars to advocate for additional measures to ensure the well-being of players, including the provision of charter flights.\n\nClark's impact on the league as a rookie has further amplified the need for improved travel arrangements, with her stellar performance in her pro debut serving as a testament to her resilience amidst the challenges of adapting to the professional basketball landscape.\n\nAs the league continues to address these concerns, it is evident that players like Clark are at the forefront of driving positive change and advocating for a more seamless and secure environment for all WNBA athletes.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brittney Griner"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/f90741283406053abdef9c27924ec196/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/09/17152641387847.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

(Michael Ainsworth/Associated Press)\n\nIt's new in that few here had ever paid it much attention. But now, given that all sorts of people in these parts either succeeded or failed in efforts to watch the Indiana Fever's first preseason game on some sort of livestreaming last Friday, it is of great interest.\n\nCaitlin Clark is the reason, of course. Where Clark goes, people follow. A Dallas-Fort Worth television station had a crew at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport last Thursday to record the Fever arriving there, commercially.\n\nWhich leads to another story. On Tuesday, the WNBA announced it was close to starting chartered flights for all of its teams on every trip. This is something the league's players have long wanted. Now Clark's in the league, and voila!\n\nWednesday brought news that television stations in Des Moines and Davenport will carry 17 of the Fever's 40 regular-season games as part of a network set up by media company TEGNA that also includes stations in Louisville, Cincinnati and several other markets.\n\nI'm not about to tell the Cedar Rapids stations there's an opportunity out there, not being one who wants to deal with their out-of-state corporate overlords.\n\nMost of the Fever's games will easily be found to Eastern Iowa viewers. Eight will be on Ion, one of those networks you may not know you have in your cable or satellite packages, but almost surely do.\n\nESPN/ESPN2 will feature six Fever games. Five will be on Amazon Prime. ABC and CBS have two apiece, and CBS Sports Network has another.\n\nThe Fever have their second and final preseason game tonight, at home. They begin the regular-season next Tuesday at Connecticut as the first game of an ESPN2 doubleheader. The nightcap is Phoenix at the two-time defending champion Las Vegas Aces, a team that adds to Iowa's interest.\n\nMegan Gustafson, a National Player of the Year at Iowa, is on the Aces. So is rookie Kate Martin of the Hawkeyes. Former Iowa State players Bridget Carleton and Stephanie Soares play for Minnesota and Dallas, respectively.\n\nLas Vegas didn't need the addition of Clark to the WNBA to build on its following, having sold all of its 8,600 season tickets on the heels of repeating as champs. It did, however, move a home game against Indiana from its 10,000-seat arena at the Mandalay Bay casino to the 20,000-seat T-Mobile Arena.\n\nIt isn't just Clark who is pumping more oxygen into the WNBA. The Chicago Sky seem to have caught their city's attention with the addition of rookie Angel Reese of LSU.\n\nReese was the seventh pick in this year's WNBA draft, but comes in as a star. She attended the Met Gala hoop-de-doo in New York on Monday night alongside all sorts of A-listers from Nicole Kidman to Kim Kardashian to Bad Bunny to Ariana Grande to ... you get the idea.\n\nTuesday, Reese had 13 points in 19 minutes in the Sky's preseason win over New York in Chicago. Among those in the crowd was the No. 1 pick in the recent NFL draft, quarterback Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears.\n\nIt isn't the WNBA I saw in 2000 when I was assigned to go to Salt Lake City to do a story on former Iowa player Kim Herrig of Dubuque and former Iowa State player Stacy Frese of Cedar Rapids, who were teammates on the Utah Starzz.\n\nLike Carver-Hawkeye Arena used to be for Iowa women's basketball games, the then-Delta Center had its balcony curtained off for Starzz games. On a warm Friday night in Utah, not a lot of people were drawn to see their WNBA team host the Detroit Shock.\n\nThe announced attendance was a season-high 7,649. \"Announced\" was the operative word.\n\nUtah and Detroit left the league soon enough, as did WNBA teams in six other cities. The league survived, though, and now is positioned to leap forward as more of its players enter the national sports consciousness led by Iowa's own Clark.\n\nTonight's Indiana preseason game is on the WNBA app, at 6 p.m., CT. After that, you'll have an easy time finding the games of Clark and all the brilliant players she will play with and against.", "source": {"uri": "thegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Some tickets closer to the floor are selling for several thousand dollars. The median average price for a ticket to the game appears to be right around $300.\n\nFor comparison, the Connecticut Sun have an average ticket price right around $45. Clark is sending prices skyrocketing.\n\nShe hasn't even played a single regular season game yet, but is clearly making her impact felt.\n\nDid you ever think you'd see a regular season WNBA game have tickets selling for several hundred dollars or even north of $1,000? Admittedly, I did not, but the WNBA has never had a player who is the draw of Clark before.\n\nThe league has the chance to take itself to a new level by riding the hype train that comes with Caitlin Clark.\n\nWe'll have to wait to see how it goes, but I think it's safe to say hype for Clark isn't slowing down.

But now, given that all sorts of people in these parts either succeeded or failed in efforts to watch the Indiana Fever's first preseason game on some sort of livestreaming last Friday, it is of great interest.\n\nCaitlin Clark is the reason, of course. Where Clark goes, people follow. A Dallas-Fort Worth television station had a crew at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport last Thursday to record the Fever arriving there, commercially.\n\nWhich leads to another story. On Tuesday, the WNBA announced it was close to starting chartered flights for all of its teams on every trip. This is something the league's players have long wanted. Now Clark's in the league, and voila!\n\nWednesday brought news that television stations in Des Moines and Davenport will carry 17 of the Fever's 40 regular-season games as part of a network set up by media company TEGNA that also includes stations in Louisville, Cincinnati and several other markets.\n\nI'm not about to tell the Cedar Rapids stations there's an opportunity out there, not being one who wants to deal with their out-of-state corporate overlords.\n\nMost of the Fever's games will easily be found to Eastern Iowa viewers. Eight will be on Ion, one of those networks you may not know you have in your cable or satellite packages, but almost surely do.\n\nESPN/ESPN2 will feature six Fever games. Five will be on Amazon Prime. ABC and CBS have two apiece, and CBS Sports Network has another.\n\nThe Fever have their second and final preseason game Thursday night, at home. They begin the regular season next Tuesday at Connecticut as the first game of an ESPN2 doubleheader. The nightcap is Phoenix at the two-time defending champion Las Vegas Aces, a team that adds to Iowa's interest.\n\nMegan Gustafson, a National Player of the Year at Iowa, is on the Aces. So is rookie Kate Martin of the Hawkeyes. Former Iowa State players Bridget Carleton and Stephanie Soares play for Minnesota and Dallas, respectively.\n\nLas Vegas didn't need the addition of Clark to the WNBA to build on its following, having sold all of its 8,600 season tickets on the heels of repeating as champs. It did, however, move a home game against Indiana from its 10,000-seat arena at the Mandalay Bay casino to the 20,000-seat T-Mobile Arena.\n\nIt isn't just Clark who is pumping more oxygen into the WNBA. The Chicago Sky seem to have caught their city's attention with the addition of rookie Angel Reese of LSU.\n\nReese was the seventh pick in this year's WNBA draft, but comes in as a star. She attended the Met Gala hoop-de-doo in New York on Monday night alongside all sorts of A-listers from Nicole Kidman to Kim Kardashian to Bad Bunny to Ariana Grande to ... you get the idea.\n\nTuesday, Reese had 13 points in 19 minutes in the Sky's preseason win over New York in Chicago. Among those in the crowd was the No. 1 pick in the recent NFL Draft, quarterback Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears.\n\nIt isn't the WNBA I saw in 2000 when I was assigned to go to Salt Lake City to do a story on former Iowa player Kim Herrig of Dubuque and former Iowa State player Stacy Frese of Cedar Rapids, who were teammates on the Utah Starzz.\n\nLike Carver-Hawkeye Arena used to be for Iowa women's basketball games, the then-Delta Center had its balcony curtained off for Starzz games. On a warm Friday night in Utah, not a lot of people were drawn to see their WNBA team host the Detroit Shock.\n\nThe announced attendance was a season-high 7,649. \"Announced\" was the operative word.\n\nUtah and Detroit left the league soon enough, as did WNBA teams in six other cities. The league survived, though, and now is positioned to leap forward as more of its players enter the national sports consciousness led by Iowa's own Clark.\n\nThursday's Indiana preseason game is on the WNBA app, at 6 p.m., CT. After that, you'll have an easy time finding the games of Clark and all the brilliant players she will play with and against.", "source": {"uri": "thegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Prices skyrocket!", "body": "WNBA. Caitlin Clark breaks protocol at her ESPN documentary premiere and the cameras could not look away\n\nThe WNBA is buzzing with excitement as the highly anticipated debut of rookie sensation Caitlin Clark is just around the corner. The Indiana Fever will be heading to Connecticut to take on the Sun on May 12, marking the official start of the Caitlin Clark era in the league.\n\nThe hype surrounding Clark is evident in the soaring ticket prices for her debut. The average ticket cost is around $150, a significant increase from the usual prices in the league. On platforms like StubHub and TicketMaster, prices are reaching new heights. The cheapest ticket on StubHub is currently going for $99 (before fees), while on TicketMaster, it's priced at $161.28 (before fees). Some seats are even being listed for as much as $1000, $2000, $3000, and over $4000.\n\nIn contrast, tickets for other games on the same night are significantly lower. For example, tickets to see the Washington Mystics host the New York Liberty are priced at $35, and tickets to see the Seattle Storm host the Minnesota Lynx are going for $30 per seat.\n\nClark's potential was on full display during her preseason debut, where she showcased her skills with 21 points, 3 rebounds, and 2 assists in just 28 minutes of game time. This performance has only added to the anticipation surrounding her official entry into the league.\n\nIn addition to Clark, the 2024 WNBA season will also feature the debut of other exciting rookies such as Cameron Brink and Angel Reese, who recently made headlines by attending the Met Gala. With such promising new talent entering the league, the competition for accolades is heating up.\n\nClark is already being touted as the overwhelming favorite for the Rookie of the Year award and is also considered the fourth betting favorite to win the league's MVP award.\n\nFurthermore, Clark's arrival has elevated the Indiana Fever's standing in the league. They are now considered outside contenders for the WNBA title, with bookies placing them as the sixth best odds to win the 2024 championship, trailing behind teams like the Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, Connecticut Sun, Seattle Storm, and Dallas Wings.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Lynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Lynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/c7fadae6e64490dd9e9abddfed9f0d57/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/08/17151914302441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 312}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Her replica No 22 jersey sold out on the league's official store within an hour of her being drafted. StubHub announced its sales for WNBA games were up 93% compared with last season. Last week the Dallas Wings and Atlanta Dream confirmed they'd sold out their season-ticket packages after the vaunted Las Vegas Aces did the same in March. When the WNBA's streaming app failed to carry a preseason contest on Friday that featured the debuts of Chicago's Angel Reese and Minnesota's Kamilla Cardoso, a fan's cellphone livestream from the stands racked up over half a million views on the night and more than 2.5m overall in the days since.\n\nAnd for all of the justifiable hand-wringing over Clark's humble $76,000 rookie salary, her recently inked $28m endorsement deal with Nike is no small consolation, say nothing of previous lucrative pacts with the likes of Gatorade, State Farm, Xfinity and Panini.\n\nHeady times, indeed. But the honeymoon won't last long. It's going to be a whole new ballgame for Clark when Indiana open their season against the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday night at Mohegan Sun Arena - and no one seems to know it better than Clark herself.\n\n\"The WNBA is so competitive right now,\" Clark said last month in Brooklyn after Indiana confirmed America's worst-kept secret by making her the top pick. \"Every single time you step on the floor, it's going to be a rivalry. I think so many teams are loaded with so much talent. This is the most competitive league in the entire world. Less than 144 spots.\"\n\nThat's no exaggeration. While the NBA is composed of 30 teams with up to 15 players allowed on a regular-season roster, the WNBA is currently made up of 12 teams with no more than 12 players apiece - with many clubs not even fielding the maximum due to rigid salary cap constraints. Unlike the NBA's G League, there's no developmental circuit where players who miss the cut can fall back and hone their skills, at least not domestically. And while opportunities do exist abroad, many of those spots are taken by established WNBA players supplementing their salaries in the offseason. The war in Ukraine and Brittney Griner's nine-month incarceration have further complicated matters since few overseas leagues offered better pay than Russia.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark can take women's basketball to a level never seen before\n\nIt's wrought an ruthless numbers game that reflects a cutthroat reality. Of the 36 players selected in the 2023 WNBA draft, only 15 appeared on opening-day rosters while barely half (19) have appeared in even one game at any point. Since 2018, more than one-third of all draft picks - 74 of 216 (34.3%) - have yet to play a single minute of a WNBA contest.\n\n\"We've even seen in recent years first-round picks who weren't able to stick their rookie year,\" ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said in a conference call with reporters last month. \"The hardest part of this conversation every year is the reality is that second and third-round picks have a really hard time making WNBA rosters. First-round picks that go late have a hard time making WNBA rosters. We talk about a league of 144. It's not a league of 144. Many of these teams only carry 11 players and maybe by the end of the season they can carry a 12th.\"\n\nThe encouraging long-term news is the WNBA will, in fact, be expanding. The Bay Area was awarded a franchise in October that will join the league next year, while commissioner Cathy Englebert said on draft night that she believes it will add 14th, 15th and 16th teams by 2028.\n\nHigh lottery picks like Clark, Reese, Cardoso, the LA Sparks' Cameron Brink and Washington Mystics' Aaliyah Edwards don't have to worry about making the opening-day roster. But a relative sense of job security won't make it any easier on Tuesday they get their first taste of live fire on a circuit where veterans have been famously unsparing on newcomers. Look no further than Diana Taurasi, the 42-year-old floor general still operating at an elite level entering her 20th season with the Phoenix Mercury. Asked last month what Clark has in store for her when the year begins, Taurasi was typically to the point.\n\n\"Reality is coming,\" Taurasi said. \"There's levels to this thing. We all went through it. That happens on the NBA side, and you're going to see it on this side. You look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you're going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\"\n\nRelated: The Las Vegas Aces are the next great American sports dynasty\n\n\"Not saying that it's not going to translate, because when you're great at what you do, you're just going to get better, but there is going to be a transition period when you have to give some grace as a rookie.\"\n\nESPN analyst Andraya Carter, who thinks Clark's range, shot-making and vision will translate immediately to the professional level, was a bit more tactful when asked to assess what challenges the 6ft point guard will face.\n\n\"Challenge-wise, the physicality of going against grown women is going to be tough,\" Carter said. \"The hits are going to be a little bit harder, the checks are going to be harder. The defense is going to be more physical, and the players will be faster. Just getting everybody that goes from college to the next level, talks about the speed of the game. Everything is going to be faster. Everything is going to be tougher.\"\n\nFor all the column-inches that have been devoted to whether this rookie class will be able to carry over the momentum from a transformative college basketball season to the WNBA, none of it will matter when the rubber hits the road on Tuesday night. From there performance overtakes potential as the only thing that matters.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are actively creating change within the league on a level that has not happened in the past, even though the Draft took place less than a month ago.\n\nAnd both superstar athletes are not anywhere close to done!\n\nAs things currently stand, there is a pretty big jump between the lifestyle of a women's college basketball player and a professional. At Iowa and LSU, Clark and Reese had top-tier facilities and a full-time staff to help them with things like recovery and nutrition.\n\nThat is not always the case in the WNBA. Clark's first practice with the Indiana Fever illustrated a stark contrast in team facilities across the league. Her teammates are in awe of how quickly they went from playing in front of six fans at an outdated arena that smells like farm animals to sold-out NBA arenas.\n\nAnd then there is the whole travel issue.\n\nWhile in college, Clark and Reese primarily flew on chartered planes. Rarely, if ever, did they fly commercial. Up until recently, the WNBA flew commercial.\n\nA video of Clark and the Indiana Fever walking through the airport among the common folk forced the league to act quickly. League commissioner Cathy Englebert recently said that a \"full-time charter\" for this season will begin \"as soon as they can get planes.\"\n\nHer comments came shortly after Clark discussed the possibility of a holdout. The WNBA Player's Association can opt out of its current Collective Bargaining Agreement after the 2024 season and this year's rookie class might lead that charge.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grayson_weir@brobible.com", "name": "Grayson Weir", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/angel-reese-caitlin-clark-wnba-cba-bargaining-agreement.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

She also broke Steph Curry's NCAA record for most 3-pointers in a single season, and she's the first Division 1 player to record 3,600-plus points, 1,000 assists, and 850-plus rebounds in a career.\n\nDue to the hype around Ms. Clark and South Carolina's unbeaten season, the Women's NCAA National Championship Game drew a record average of 18.7 million viewers while peaking at 24 million. That crushed the men's final between UConn and Purdue, which averaged 14.8 million. It was the third time in a week the NCAA women's tournament broke a record for its largest television audience.\n\nTeam USA isn't about to ignore Ms. Clark's prolific scoring and television appeal when drafting its roster for Paris, where the Americans are seeking their eighth consecutive gold medal and 10th overall.\n\nMs. Clark also has a good excuse for not attending the pre-Olympic training camp at Cleveland. It came during the weekend Iowa played in the NCAA Women's Final Four. As for her lack of WNBA experience, she dropped 21 points in the Fever's preseason debut, a 79-76 loss at Dallas Saturday. Indiana closes out its preseason Thursday night against the Atlanta Dream and opens its regular season on May 14 against the Connecticut Sun at the Mohegan Sun Arena. That game will stream on Disney+, ESPN+, and ESPN2.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Clark's impact continues to reverberate throughout the WNBA. The Los Angeles Sparks announced this week that Ms. Clark's first WNBA game at Los Angeles on May 24 is one of three games being moved to the 19,000-seat Crypto.com Arena from the 5,000-seat Walter Pyramid on the Long Beach State campus.\n\nThe Sparks, who drafted Stanford's star, Cameron Brink, with the second overall pick, initially scheduled games at Long Beach due to construction at Crypto.com Arena. Los Angeles now wants to take advantage of the interest in Ms. Clark, Ms. Brink, and the WNBA. The Sparks games against Dallas, May 26, and Minnesota, June 5, are also being moved to the Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\"Women's basketball is experiencing unprecedented viewership and attendance numbers,\" the Sparks president, Christine Monjer, said in a team release. \"So moving these games back to Crypto.com Arena provides us the ability to have more fans in the stands and have our players back to competing on their home floor.\"\n\nAlso, the WNBA announced plans to fund charter flights for all of the league's teams after the social media backlash following reports of Ms. Clark and the Indiana Fever team traveling commercial for their preseason game at Dallas. The league commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, said the move will cost the WNBA about $25 million annually. The league already agreed to pay for charter flights during the playoffs and back-to-back games during the regular season. The WNBA spent $4 million providing charter flights last year.\n\nMeanwhile, an Indy Star columnist, Gregg Doyel, is expected to return to work on May 13 after a brief suspension for an unprofessional exchange with Ms. Clark during her introductory press conference in Indiana. Mr. Doyel opened his questioning of Ms. Clark by displaying his hands in the shape of her popular heart gesture. When Ms. Clark explained her hand signal is for her family, Mr. Doyel said, \"Start doing it with me and we'll get along just fine.\"\n\nA father of two, Mr. Doyel offered an apology but will not cover Fever games this summer, though he can still write about the team.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Unfortunately, Indiana won't be at its full potential yet, as Kelsey Mitchell is expected to sit out once again with an ankle injury. Mitchell's absence will force newbies like Clark and Celeste Taylor to make their impact loud and clear.\n\nThe Dream defeated the Mystics, 87-84, in their preseason opener. Every player that stepped on the court scored at least four points, including 2022 Rookie of the Year award winner Rhyne Howard. During the offseason, Atlanta added some much-needed experience by acquiring Tina Charles and Jordin Canada, who is currently dealing with a hand injury.\n\nWhile smaller franchises, both the Fever and Dream are expected to have breakout seasons in 2024.

That spike in public interest and action is carrying over to WNBA odds.\n\nClark will make her professional debut for the Indiana Fever on May 14, and sportsbooks have already felt the impact of her entrance into the league. They expect those wagers to continue throughout the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to BetMGM sportsbooks, the Fever have drawn the highest bet count to win the WNBA Championship, pulling in almost 49% of the total tickets written on that 12-team market.\n\nThat one-sided support is there despite projections that have Indiana as a .500 team in a top-heavy league dominated by the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty. Clark is also seeing the most bets placed on any player to win MVP at BetMGM, sitting as short as the third overall favorite at some operators (+950 to +1,200) in her rookie season.\n\nThat spike in \"public\" betting action from the casual fan is something that wasn't there before in past WNBA seasons.\n\nWhile the league has been gaining popularity, the WNBA betting markets have always been \"shark-infested waters\" driven by sharper gamblers looking to exploit a niche market offering softer odds than its NBA brethren.\n\nAccording to bookmakers, the Indiana Fever will be the most popular team for WNBA bettors this season, at least to begin the schedule. And those Caitlin Clark fans blindly betting Indiana's point spreads and moneylines will influence the odds.\n\n\"The first two games they play will likely have an adjusted spread,\" Aron Wattleworth, trading manager at bet365, tells Covers.\n\n\"Definitely expect more moneyline action on Indiana early on but spread action will be the main market to see a large rise in the earlier portion of the season, given the opponents they have.\" - Aron Wattleworth\n\nOdds for the opening games of the 2024 WNBA have been available for wagering since late April, with Clark & Co. opening as 5.5-point road underdogs against the Connecticut Sun on May 14. As of Wednesday morning, many books have the vig on the Fever +5.5 up to -118 (instead of -110), padding this spread in preparation for that public appeal and a move to +5 or shorter.\n\nDriving that public play on Indiana is an increase in visibility. Causal fans are more apt to wager on games they're watching, and the Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised by the WNBA's national broadcast and streaming partners -- the most of any team this season. Tuesday's opening game at Connecticut will be available on ESPN2 but will also be the first live sporting event to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"I expect the Fever games to be among the most highly wagered games this season,\" Jeff Shermon, vice president of risk management for SuperBook Sports, tells Covers. \"This league is still driven predominantly by sharp support, so we'll just try to put out the sharpest line and let the public play away.\"\n\nThe blind betting on Clark doesn't stop at Indiana's futures and nightly odds either.\n\nWNBA player props have increased at mainstream operators the past two summers but haven't been as widely available as NBA props. That's going to change in 2024.\n\nKnowing the demand for everything Caitlin Clark, more operators will offer WNBA player props -- or at least isolated markets on the new face of the league. And if Clark's influence over the NCAAW odds is any indication, the Over option on just about all statistical totals will be a popular pick.\n\nDuring Iowa's postseason run in the NCAA Tournament, sportsbook operators were seeing more bets placed on Over offerings for Clark's point totals and 3-point totals than any player prop from the men's bracket.\n\nBased on her popularity as a player, bookmakers could see her game-to-game prop action drawing more money than the spread, moneyline, and Over/Under for Indiana's games overall. The rapid growth in player-specific wagering stems from fantasy sports and sees superstars often outpace their own teams in terms of betting handle.\n\n\"People may not know who else plays for Miami FC, but they know Messi. They may not know all the Lakers, but they know LeBron. And although most probably can't name more than three WNBA players, they know it's where they can watch Caitlin Clark play,\" - Wattleworth\n\n\"In that, they know where they can bet on her to score X-amount of points or make so many 3-pointers, regardless of whether her team wins or covers any spread or total.\"\n\nBettors don't have to wait for Clark's debut to start wagering on her output. Many sportsbooks have a full menu of Caitlin Clark props odds available, allowing you to wager on her rookie season milestones and Over/Under props for her season scoring, assist, and 3-point averages.\n\nThose season-long Clark props are outpacing the Fever's futures -- title odds, playoffs props, and win totals -- at many sportsbooks this spring and rank among the most popular WNBA markets of the offseason.\n\nIf you've been around sports gambling long enough, you've heard about the bookmakers' \"Tax\".\n\nBooks will pad their offerings on the most popular options to offset the expected flood of money from \"public\" bettors. Things like the \"Yankee Tax\" upping the cost on the New York Yankees' moneyline or inflating the totals for primetime NFL games knowing the casual fan wants to bet the Over.\n\nCould Caitlin Clark's mass appeal have a similar influence over oddsmakers when it comes to the Fever's lines and player props?\n\nThe short answer from bookies is \"No\". At least not yet.\n\nWNBA markets don't draw enough public handle to force that proactive thinking, especially with sharper bettors -- who outweigh the public money -- exploiting any errors in the odds.\n\n\"We expect (bets on Clark) will continue in the WNBA, as long as she performs at a high level,\" John Ewing, PR data analyst for BetMGM says. \"The trading team creates props based off of matchups. If Clark consistently goes Over her props, then the trading team will increase the prop totals.\"\n\nThose books originating WNBA odds respect the sharp opinion and use those early bets to fine-tune their offerings before the bulk of wagers are placed closer to tipoff. It will be business as usual when it comes to Clark odds, despite the unusual amount of interest.\n\n\"The first two games (the Fever) will play will likely have an adjusted spread, however, it's a tough start in the WNBA for good young players in their first years out of college. It can be a very steep learning curve.\" - Wattleworth\n\n\"One thing's for sure, all eyes will be on Clark and Indiana at the start of the season.\"", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/a2b2cf8c-9312-4920-b45c-5623fd0778fd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 412, "textEnd": 418, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

For a rookie class led by Caitlin Clark, it'll be a whole new ballgame\n\nFrom the moment Caitlin Clark was tapped by the Indiana Fever with the first overall pick in last month's WNBA draft, the buzz surrounding the ponytailed once-in-a-generation basketball folk hero from the American heartland has only redoubled.\n\nThe 22-year-old native of West Des Moines, who broke Pete Maravich's 54-year-old record to become the all-time leading scorer in major college basketball history earlier this year, is the bandleader of a sensational WNBA rookie class that has drawn millions of new fans to the women's game in recent months - and generated an unprecedented sense of excitement as the league's 28th season tips off on Tuesday night.\n\nSignposts of the so-called Caitlin Clark Effect are everywhere you look. Her replica No 22 jersey sold out on the league's official store within an hour of her being drafted. StubHub announced its sales for WNBA games were up 93% compared with last season. Last week the Dallas Wings and Atlanta Dream announced they'd sold out their season-ticket packages after the vaunted Las Vegas Aces did the same in March. When the WNBA's streaming app failed to carry a preseason contest on Friday that featured the debuts of Chicago's Angel Reese and Minnesota's Kamilla Cardoso, a fan's cellphone livestream from the stands racked up over half a million views on the night and more than 2.5m overall in the days since.\n\nAnd for all of the justifiable hand-wringing over Clark's humble $76,000 rookie salary, her recently inked $28m endorsement deal with Nike is no small consolation, say nothing of previous lucrative pacts with the likes of Gatorade, State Farm, Xfinity and Panini.\n\nHeady times, indeed. But the honeymoon won't last long. It's going to be a whole new ballgame for Clark when Indiana open their season against the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday night at Mohegan Sun Arena - and no one seems to know it better than Clark herself.\n\n\"The WNBA is so competitive right now,\" Clark said last month in Brooklyn after Indiana confirmed America's worst-kept secret by making her the top pick. \"Every single time you step on the floor, it's going to be a rivalry. I think so many teams are loaded with so much talent. This is the most competitive league in the entire world. [There's] less than 144 spots.\"\n\nThat's no exaggeration. While the NBA is composed of 30 teams with up to 15 players allowed on a regular-season roster, the WNBA is currently made up of 12 teams with no more than 12 players apiece - with many clubs not even fielding the maximum due to rigid salary cap constraints. Unlike the NBA's G League, there's no developmental circuit where players who miss the cut can fall back and hone their skills, at least not domestically. And while opportunities do exist abroad, many of those spots are taken by established WNBA players supplementing their salaries in the offseason. The war in Ukraine and Brittney Griner's nine-month incarceration in Moscow have further complicated matters since few overseas leagues offered better pay than Russia.\n\nIt's wrought an ruthless numbers game that reflects a cutthroat reality. Of the 36 players selected in the 2023 WNBA draft, only 15 appeared on opening-day rosters while barely half (19) have appeared in even one game at any point. Since 2018, more than one-third of all draft picks - 74 of 216 (34.3%) - have yet to play a single minute of a WNBA contest.\n\n\"We've even seen in recent years first-round picks who weren't able to stick their rookie year,\" ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said in a conference call with reporters last month. \"The hardest part of this conversation every year is the reality is that second and third-round picks have a really hard time making WNBA rosters. First-round picks that go late have a hard time making WNBA rosters. We talk about a league of 144. It's not a league of 144. Many of these teams only carry 11 players and maybe by the end of the season they can carry a 12th.\"\n\nThe encouraging long-term news is the WNBA will, in fact, be expanding. The Bay Area was awarded a franchise in October that will join the league next year, while commissioner Cathy Englebert said on draft night that she believes it will add 14th, 15th and 16th teams by 2028.\n\nHigh lottery picks like Clark, Reese, Cardoso, the LA Sparks' Cameron Brink and Washington's Aaliyah Edwards don't have to worry about making the opening-day roster. But a relative sense of job security won't make it any easier on Tuesday they get their first taste of live fire on a circuit where veterans have been famously unsparing on newcomers. Look no further than Diana Taurasi, the 42-year-old floor general still operating at an elite level entering her 20th season with the Phoenix Mercury. Asked last month what Clark has in store for her when the year begins, Taurasi was typically to the point.\n\n\"Reality is coming,\" Taurasi said. \"There's levels to this thing. We all went through it. That happens on the NBA side, and you're going to see it on this side. You look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you're going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\"\n\n\"Not saying that it's not going to translate, because when you're great at what you do, you're just going to get better, but there is going to be a transition period when you have to give some grace as a rookie.\"\n\nESPN analyst Andraya Carter, who thinks Clark's range, shot-making and vision will translate immediately to the professional level, was a bit more tactful when asked to assess what challenges the 6ft point guard will face.\n\n\"Challenge-wise, the physicality of going against grown women is going to be tough,\" Carter said. \"The hits are going to be a little bit harder, the checks are going to be harder. The defense is going to be more physical, and the players will be faster. Just getting everybody that goes from college to the next level, talks about the speed of the game. Everything is going to be faster. Everything is going to be tougher.\"\n\nFor all the column-inches that have been devoted to whether this rookie class will be able to carry over the momentum from a transformative college basketball season to the WNBA, none of it will matter when the rubber hits the road on Tuesday night. From there performance overtakes potential as the only thing that matters.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ticket sales for the Fever were more than 13 times higher on resale platform StubHub compared to last year.\n\nClark's team mate, last year's unanimous rookie of the year Aliyah Boston, said the Fever had energy around them going into the season.\n\n\"Having Caitlin here is just great for this franchise, for the people of Indiana, just because of how many eyes that she draws,\" said Boston.\n\n\"Having fans, having everyone come, everyone's just excited to watch you play.

The first was the recently-retired legend Candace Parker, who did so with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2008.\n\nTherefore, it isn't unprecedented for a rookie to be the WNBA's best player. And Clark has shown plenty of times that she's talented enough to make it happen; especially after already having proven that she won't struggle to score in the WNBA.\n\nYet, the Iowa legend will need some of the following five scenarios to occur if she's to become league MVP by season's end.\n\nHere are the five ways that Clark can win the 2024 WNBA MVP:\n\nIn 2023, New York Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu set the WNBA record for most three-pointers made in a season, with 128.\n\nClark drained 201 three's in her final college season, and made five during her WNBA debut on May 3. If she was to average five three-pointers made per game during the 2024 regular season, she'd break Ionescu's record by 72.\n\nIf Clark stays healthy, it's not only possible, but likely, that she'll set a new three-point record this season.\n\nAnd getting that record would not only help her MVP hopes, but it would also mean that she's scoring a lot of points.\n\nInjuries are inevitable in sports. In 2023, The Next Hoops tallied 175 injuries during the WNBA season.\n\nAs much as we hope it doesn't happen, if either of the two most likely MVP candidates (A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart) were to get injured, that increase Clark's chances to win MVP.\n\nOf course, Clark also needs to stay healthy if she has any chance of securing the MVP award. But she never missed a college game due to injury, so that bodes well for her.\n\nClark sat out much of the third quarter of Indiana's May 3 preseason game because she was in foul trouble. This is a common theme for many WNBA (and NBA) rookies.\n\nSimilar to why she'll need to avoid injuries, Clark must stay on the court if she's to win MVP this season.\n\nIt would also help if she frequented the foul line. Clark was third in the NCAA in free throws attempted last season, and second in free throws made.\n\nThis trend will have to continue if she has any hope of winning MVP.\n\nOkay, there's about a 0% chance that the WNBA will institute a four-point line during the 2024 WNBA season.\n\nBut they use one at the All-Star Game, and it would certainly add excitement if they added one!\n\nAnd no WNBA player would benefit more from a four-point line than Caitlin Clark.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_young@heavy.com", "name": "Grant Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151503495-e1715286969288.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 862, "textEnd": 867, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

While this form of travel has been the norm for awhile, even college teams aren't flying commercial. It was a tough look for the WNBA to have its most popular player of all-time (at least in terms of name recognition) trying to keep a low profile while taking the same commercial flight alongside the regular John Smiths and Jane Does of the world.\n\nThey flew commercial and squeezed into the seats. They had to get their bags at baggage claim. All of that stuff.\n\nPeople who purchased first class tickets had it better than the Indiana Fever!\n\nClark spoke about the trip prior to departure and explained that it is what it is. She actually started to lobby for a holdout in effort to include charter travel as part of the next Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nWNBA players may not even have to wait that long...\n\nThe league is actively trying to fix the travel issue less than a week after the airport video went viral.

This was done because of a scheduling conflict as the NBA's Indiana Pacers host the New York Knicks for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Final series.\n\nThe upcoming matchup will be Caitlin Clark's first game at the Fever's home ground and will feature a sold-out crowd who'll be there to watch the star make her preseason home court debut.\n\nAtlanta Dream vs Indiana Fever: Preview\n\nThe Atlanta Dream are coming off an 87-84 win against the Washington Mystics whom they faced for their first preseason game on Saturday. Destanni Henderson recorded seven points, three rebounds, four assists, and one steal in the game to lead the Dream to victory.\n\nPreviously, the Dream secured the fifth spot in the 2023 WNBA playoffs with a 19-21 record last season. They concluded their season with a 2-0 defeat in the first round of the playoffs against the Dallas Wings.\n\nOn the other hand, the Indiana Fever head into the matchup after a 79-76 loss against the Dallas Wings on Saturday.

Image Credits - USA Today Sports\n\nColts legend Peyton Manning is the latest to share his excitement to see Caitlin Clark's new journey in Indiana. And Manning has a special reason, besides being an Indiana Fever fan. The former NFL star's 'Full Court Press' docuseries, a tribute to women's college basketball, features the WNBA No.1 Draft pick.\n\nBankrolled by Manning's Omaha Productions, the four-part series chronicles the journey of Carolina center Kamilla Cardoso and UCLA star Kiki Rice alongside Caitlin. Thus, Manning and Caitlin shared the same red carpet for the world premiere on Monday night. And it was a special moment for sports fans.\n\nSpeaking to the reporters on the sidelines, a vocal Caitlin talked about how Peyton Manning convinced her to join the docuseries. She also shed light on why she joined as an executive producer. Additionally, Caitlin also gave her opinion on how the show came out in its final cut. She revealed,\n\n\"He (Peyton Manning) was the man. He pitched it to me and I'm an executive producer on the show. So I watched it. I thought I added some stuff. Peyton was very involved. He was the one who had the first idea of it. They knew the hype around women's basketball,\" Clark said at Newfields.\n\nThe WNBA sensation also expressed her desire to join more projects for women athletes in the future. One of the major WNBA talents, Caitlin can take women's basketball to new heights, believes icons like LeBron James, following her standout 2023 season. Meanwhile, the NFL fans would hope she attends a few games of the Colts team in her off-season.\n\nA football lover, Clark recently admitted that she is a fan of the Chiefs while appearing on the Pat McAfee Show. Clark also revealed that she is a 'passionate fan' of Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes. And NFL legend Peyton Manning took notice of her words. A hilarious Manning quipped he would forgive Clark for being a Chiefs fan.\n\n\"She was a guest on our (Monday Night Football) show. She's a Chiefs fan, I forgive her for that. But she said she did grow up watching me play,\" Manning told the media.\n\nThe premiere of the docuseries is scheduled on ESPN+ this weekend. Meanwhile, Clark is set to make her WNBA regular season debut on May 14. It remains to be seen whether Peyton Manning will join the action to cheer for the WNBA star.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Productions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/d9609785-peyton-manning-and-caitlin-clark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2250, "textEnd": 2256}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Three hours before her Indiana Fever took on the Dallas Wings in a preseason run-out the other night, fans wearing her University of Iowa singlet were already lined up outside the venue. For a game that meant nothing. The upper deck of College Park Center, often empty and usually covered with tarp for competitive WNBA matches, was full, every ticket sold. Unheard of.\n\nWithin an hour of the Fever selecting Clark with the number one pick in the WNBA draft last month, her number 22 shirt sold out. Thirty-six of her 40 games in the coming campaign will be nationally televised; Nike just signed her to an endorsement deal, including a signature shoe, worth $28 million over eight years; and the Fever are going to pay her an annual salary of $76,535. The last, startling number has generated the most headlines. Clark's record-setting, groundbreaking achievements at the collegiate level may have captured the American imagination but she's entering a league where the highest-paid player earns $252,420 and she will remain on the rookie basic for her first four seasons.\n\nConscious that six teams have folded in its 27-year existence, the league adheres to a rigid salary structure and that financial prudence extends to transportation. Aside from during the playoffs, WNBA players always flew commercial rather than chartered flights across the country, a budgetary constraint that exerts a physical toll on tall athletes folded into economy seats for journeys up to 3,000 miles, at the end of which they must then play games.\n\nWhen Clark touched down at Dallas-Fort Worth airport last week, greeted by television news crews, the stir caused by her presence in baggage claim immediately intensified the argument around personal security and how players travel to games. Last Tuesday, the WNBA announced it spend more than $12 million per season underwriting private planes for teams.\n\nThat's only one representation of the Clark effect. Aping what Sporting Kansas City did for the recent visit of Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, teams are already moving matches against the Fever to larger venues to cash in on her broader appeal. For some, this could mean flogging 17,000 rather than 6,000 tickets for games. The sound you hear is tills ringing.\n\nWith television audiences, broadcast rights deals and advertising set to spike, revenues are going to go way up. This may explain why so much coverage of her impending debut has been giddy and breathless. One male journalist, since reassigned, mortifyingly made a heart sign to her before asking a question at a recent press conference and the tone of some arriviste reporting has, at times, been a tad dismissive of how much hard work it has taken to keep the league alive this long. There was women's basketball before Clark.\n\nIn the WNBA's first quarter-of-a-century in existence, women's professional soccer had three different iterations of a pro league, two of which failed spectacularly. The basketball equivalent endured through financial underpinning by the NBA and opting for slow and steady growth, paying players what they could afford rather than what they were worth, and even now has just 12 teams.\n\nFor all that, it has always boasted the best distaff ballers in the world - just none whose fame transcended sport the way Clark's does. Inevitably, some have attempted to concoct drama in which a few of these older, more established stars are supposedly bristling at the fuss being made about her imminent arrival. They are not. They have, however, offered realistic takes on potential teething problems.\n\n\"There's levels to this thing,\" said the Phoenix Mercury's Diana Taurasi, entering her 20th season and acknowledged as the best shooter in WNBA history. \"You look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you're going to be playing against some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time. Not saying her skills are not gonna translate, because when you're great at what you do, you're just gonna get better. But there is gonna be a transition period where you're gonna have to give yourself some grace as a rookie.\"\n\n[ Dave Hannigan: Caitlin Clark ready to extend the boundaries of women's basketball ]\n\nNobody doubts Clark will adjust to the faster-paced, more physical pro game. She poured in 21 points against the Dallas Wings. But there are concerns the WNBA might be ill-equipped for the obsessive interest surrounding her. The league's streaming pass service experienced glitches on the opening night of preseason amid suspicions those in charge don't quite grasp the enormity of what they have here. This is a woman poised to bring eyeballs to her sport in a way no athlete has managed since Tiger Woods turned every golf tournament into must-see TV, simultaneously transforming the earning power of all his peers.\n\nIf that's enormous pressure to heap upon a 22-year-old, Clark has been one of the most famous athletes in the US for a while now and has never once looked like she struggles with the burden of recognition, or the increasingly ludicrous demands placed upon her by celebrity. When she turned up to watch the Indiana Pacers vs Milwaukee Bucks playoff recently, a woman asked her to sign an ultrasound photograph of her unborn baby. Almost immediately there was feverish online speculation about how much the autographed pic might be worth at auction.\n\nLike everything she touches, its value is only going to go up.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/AcGR4DoMOpxEOd0tl0teVolRQAE=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/FA3DOPLFCJHWPFTMM3GTZ5BUJI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here.

In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there. But like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on.\n\n\"I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested. So they're going to cheer, they're going to get after the refs.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The basketball player attended the ESPN+ \"Full Court Press\" premiere on Monday in Indianapolis, wearing another outfit from the Italian luxury brand.\n\nClark's look featured a cropped cotton jacket with classic shirting details, including a buttoned collar and cuffs, and matching trousers with oversized lines and ample proportions. She completed her outfit with a white jersey tank top with Prada's triangle logo and carried a Prada Re-Edition 2002 shoulder bag. Her shoes, however, were from Stuart Weitzman.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nThe WNBA star was drafted by the Indiana Fever as the first pick on April 15. During the event, she wore head-to-toe Prada, which she said was the first time the Italian brand had dressed a player for either the WNBA or NBA draft.\n\n\"For the WNBA draft, Caitlin and I talked about putting together a look that was fresh, substantive and stayed true to her,\" stylist Adri Zgirdea, who was responsible for dressing Clark at the WNBA Draft, previously told WWD. \"I immediately knew Prada would be the perfect brand to help create a vibrant yet timeless look that was not only memorable, but a first.\"\n\nSince the WNBA Draft, Clark has also been seen in pieces from Louis Vuitton, Veronica Beard, Nike and Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger.\n\nClark is featured in the \"Full Court Press\" series, which follows the journey of her, Chicago Sky's Kamilla Cardoso and UCLA G's Kiki Rice during the 2023-24 women's college basketball season.

According to Sports Pro Media, ticket sales have skyrocketed 93 percent from last season on StubHub. Average ticket prices have jumped 80 percent for Fever games.\n\nTeams have also shifted venues to accommodate high demand when Clark comes to town. The Los Angeles Sparks recently announced a move to Crypto.com Arena, home of the Lakers, for their May 24 home game against Indiana.\n\nYet there's another reason the August game at Minnesota is a popular ticket.

Additionally, only some people are enjoying all the attention the former Iowa Hawkeye receives, even if Clark's presence, in particular, is a massive benefit for all WNBA clubs due to higher ticket sales and visibility.\n\nOne of those individuals is Minnesota Lynx Cheryl Reeve, who will also lead the USA Basketball Women's National Team in 2024.\n\nReeve, who will serve in the same head coaching role for the 2024 USA Basketball Women's National Team alongside Mike Thibault, Kara Lawson, and Joni Taylor, recently had her Minnesota Lynx team make its preseason debut against Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky on Friday.\n\nThe game was unavailable to people to watch on television, but thousands of fans tuned in to watch a live stream from a fan on social media.\n\nClark and the Indiana Fever also played their game on Friday night when they took on the Dallas Wings. WNBA social platforms promoted the top overall pick's debut by making it available for free nationally on the league's app.\n\nReeve seemed offended by the fact that only ticket holders would be allowed to watch the Lynx, which played their preseason opener against the Chicago Sky on Friday.\n\n\"ALSO in action tonight - @minnesotalynx vs @chicagosky. 7 pm CST,\" Reeve wrote on X on Friday.\n\n\"Though fans won't be able to watch, #Lynx fans can go to the Lynx app to follow along via play-by-play. Or if you are in market, come to the game...as we start the season off right #12teams #theWismorethanoneplayer.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark will earn women in the NBA far more money than they are now making, despite Reeve and other WNBA players/coaches finding it hard to accept.\n\nThe 57-year-old Reeve has led the Lynx to four WNBA titles since taking over as head coach in 2010. She also serves as the head coach of the USA women's basketball team. She also won two WNBA championships as an assistant coach with the Detroit Shock (who subsequently changed their name to the Wings).\n\nReeve could very well picture herself as Caitlin Clark's coach at the Olympics.\n\nAlso Read: Antonio Brown Is Getting Destroyed On Social Media For His Disgusting Caitlin Clark Joke\n\nThe women's basketball lineup for Team USA is still undetermined as the Olympics get underway on July 26, 2024.\n\nThe WNBA season is about to begin, and the first few weeks will be used as Clark's training camp for the Paris Games.\n\nThe Olympic 5-on-5 women's competition will feature twelve teams: Australia, the United States, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Puerto Rico, Serbia, and Spain. Each roster has a size of twelve.\n\nClark has to prove her case with her WNBA play because she did not attend the April camp or any other camp for the senior national team. Clark has played for younger USA Basketball teams.

So, I guess, I'm just excited. I'm thankful at whatever point that is it happens and occurs.\"\n\nEnglebert said the program will launch \"as soon as we can get planes in places,\" and Fever players Wednesday sang the virtues of the change.\n\n\"They deserve this, and it changes everything,\" Indiana head coach Christie Sides said. \"It changes their rest. It changes their rehab. ... It changes everything for them.\"\n\nReigning rookie of the year Aliyah Boston hasn't waited as long as her veteran teammates, but she sees the change as another step in the right direction for a league on the rise.\n\n\"That's just something that I think everyone's looking forward to,\" Boston said. \"So I'm happy that it's coming into play right now.\"\n\nMOTHER'S DAY\n\nIt's been a long wait to return to the court for forward Katie Lou Samuelson.\n\nThe fourth overall pick out of Connecticut in 2019, she missed all of the 2023 season after giving birth to her first daughter.\n\nSamuelson, who averaged a career-high 9.7 points along with 3 rebounds and 1.9 assists for the Los Angeles Sparks in 2022, signed a two-year free-agent contract with Indiana in February and was set to make her Fever debut last week. But a minor injury delayed her first game back until Thursday.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Samuelson said of balancing motherhood and basketball. \"It was definitely a challenge to get back to where I wanted to be, coming back. It was probably one of the hardest things I've done. But, every single day, it's so worth it.\n\n\"It's definitely good perspective coming into training camp this year. I finish practice and I get to go home and I get to hang out with my baby girl, and there's nothing better in the world than that. And so just doing this every single day, I hope she is able to continue to see me, continue to see all these powerful women around her. I think it's really special.\"\n\nPEYTON'S PAL\n\nClark is one of three rookies who will be featured in \"Full Court Press,\" a four-part docuseries premiering Saturday on ABC.\n\nThe show - which also focuses on South Carolina's Kamilla Cardoso and UCLA's Kiki Rice - comes from Omaha Productions, the shingle of former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\nManning has served as a mentor of sorts for Indianapolis' newest superstar.\n\n\"Peyton's just always been a really good resource even before I honestly declared for the WNBA Draft,\" Clark said. \"He was always someone that I could lean on and was very supportive of the women's game. But then, obviously, coming to Indianapolis, he couldn't be more thrilled for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors":

And while it's not necessarily a new phenomenon -- she's been a source of inspiration for many athletes throughout her career -- there's no doubt Clark's status as a member of the Indiana Fever will only further her impact.\n\nAs the former Iowa Hawkeye prepares for her WNBA rookie season, IndyStar spoke with some current high school players, coaches and trainers about Clark's influence and the impact she's had on their careers, as well as the role she and her predecessors have had in growing the game.\n\nInsider: Final shot aside, Caitlin Clark showed how much of a game-changer she can be\n\n'Absolutely incredible': How Caitlin Clark is already reinvigorating Indiana Fever fans.\n\nIt's become a superstitious ritual for the Junior All-Star from Columbia City, who's been admiring the superstar since her mom told her about an Iowa freshman who scored 35 points in back-to-back games.\n\n\"I study her,\" said Baxter, a Butler commit. \"If I have an off-game, I'll watch her (afterwards, too) and see what things she does well that help her create for not only herself, but for her teammates.\"\n\nAsked what stands out when she watches Clark, Baxter pointed to her passing prowess and how she handles pressure. \"She plays against the best of the best defenders every single game, and she keeps her head, keeps calm. She doesn't try to do too much.\"\n\nDuring her recruitment, IU commit Maya Makalusky studied standout players within various conferences, examining how they played and the systems they ran, and noting any similarities to her game.\n\nA career 41% 3-point shooter with over 1,300 points to her name, the 6-4 Hamilton Southeastern junior was drawn to Clark almost immediately.\n\n\"She's really good off drag screens and shoots the 3 really well -- freakishly well -- so after watching her and seeing the things she was already achieving by her sophomore year, I was like, I have to keep following her,\" Makalusky said.\n\n\"(Clark) makes basketball fun to watch,\" she continued, \"not only because of her 3-point shooting and the 40 points per game, but the way she acts on the court, her IQ, the confidence she has and the way she can make any player around her better.\"\n\nThat confidence and ability to raise the level of her teammates is a source of inspiration for Eastern Hancock freshman Kenzie Koch, who will be stepping into a more prominent leadership role with the regional champion Royals next season.\n\nFor her part, Koch admires Clark's ability to make plays with just a ball screen at the top, be it a shot, pass down to the big or a kick out to the corner. \"I need to get better at creating plays, so I'm trying to mimic the way (Clark) can move the ball with so much confidence,\" Koch said.\n\nAlonna Divine -- who has been following Clark on the AAU circuit since \"before she was Caitlin Clark\" -- draws inspiration from the intangible byproducts of Clark's confidence and determination.\n\n\"She never really breaks character,\" the Ben Davis sophomore said. \"It hasn't been easy (for me to reach that point). It's definitely something that happens over time, but with the right support system and mindset, you can achieve it.\"\n\n'The impact she's had ... it's a huge change'\n\nNatalie Morse once told her dad she wanted to play for the IU men's team when she grew up. \"That's all we saw, you know? And if I played, it was usually with boys in the driveway,\" said Morse, now program director for Indiana Girls Basketball (IGB). \"There were very few girls who wanted to do it.\"\n\nThere were rising stars involved at the college level like Diana Taurasi, who dominated at UConn in the early 2000s, Morse later added, but limited television exposure and media coverage made it difficult to see her. \"You didn't get to picture yourself in that place very often.\"\n\nThat's why Clark's meteoric rise has been so important. She's captured the nation's attention and has helped make women's basketball more accessible to the masses at a time when the sport's starpower is at an all-time high. There's seldom a training session when a girl isn't wearing a Clark (or Paige Bueckers) shirt, Morse said. They may not be imitating her moves, but they're inspired by the way she plays.\n\nClark gives youngsters something to aspire toward; a reason to dream big.\n\n\"The impact she has had on not just women's basketball, but basketball period -- it's a huge change,\" said Lapel sophomore Laniah Wills, a 6-0 wing with Division I aspirations herself. \"Little girls seeing her everywhere, it's encouraging them to play basketball and be just like her.\"\n\nIt's too early to fully quantify the Clark effect on the growth of girls basketball, but anecdotal indications are beginning to emerge.\n\nMorse said they struggled to have more than 3-4 middle school girls at training sessions during the \"offseason\" (January to March). But there was a significant uptick earlier this year, with more and more parents reaching out about having their daughters try basketball. The program currently has upwards of 500-550 girls per year through their program, be it a summer camp or training.\n\n\"That's all we want is for them to try it, even if they don't stick with it,\" said Fishers coach Lauren Votaw, whose mom and aunts were among \"the pioneers\" for school-based girls sports. \"It gives them something to look forward to, something to be excited about. It's a good thing we're at this place right now with women's sports.\"\n\n'It's so uplifting and has me excited for the future'\n\nFormer Zionsville star Maddie Nolan -- who played against Clark for four seasons at Michigan and this past season at Colorado -- recalled a recent conversation with her mom during an upcoming episode of IndyStar's podcast The Scorers Table.\n\nKris (Veatch) played at New Mexico State in the 1980s and was excited to get a pair of socks and a practice uniform, Nolan said. \"Now we're in the age of NIL and Caitlin recently signed a multi-million dollar shoe deal with Nike. People like my mom and (other past players) have really paved the way for us.\"\n\nClark may be the face of the ongoing women's basketball revolution, but the high schoolers interviewed for this story were all quick to credit past players and included other current stars among their favorites.\n\nDivine's entry to Clark was actually through UConn's Paige Bueckers. The Ben Davis standout followed her closely during high school, and discovered Clark when their AAU teams went head-to-head. Needless to say, she was an instant fan. \"They were girls I looked up to, so I would watch their games before my games and try to do things I saw them do,\" Divine said.\n\nNolan has watched as Zionsville youngsters' interest in women's basketball has expanded beyond her and fellow alums Rachel McLimore (IUPUI/Butler) and Delaney Richason (Vermont), because they're watching more games and following teams like defending national champion South Carolina.\n\nAt Fishers, Votaw said boys were talking with her about the women's basketball tournament, while at Columbia City, Baxter cited a significant uptick in student attendance for their games, something that's been lacking over the past few seasons.\n\nPike freshman Korinne Nickolson -- whose dad renewed his Fever season tickets by happenstance three days before the WNBA draft lottery -- felt the excitement among her friends and other students for both college hoops and their school team, with her teachers expressing excitement about learning more about the game.\n\n\"It's amazing and it's the best feeling possible, because they're opening doors for players like me and players around the world, showing us that we can do the same thing,\" Makalusky said. \"It's been motivating and proves people do care about women's sports and women's athletes. It's so uplifting and has me excited for the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name":

She'll square off against the Connecticut Sun at Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\nAs you'd expect, ticket prices for Clark's debut are quite expensive.\n\nThere are a few tickets on SeatGeek for $95, which is reasonable considering the current market. Additionally, there are tickets on sale for $115.\n\nMultiple sections for the Fever-Sun are listed in the $260-$320 range. If you want to sit courtside, you'd need to spend at least $1,700 on a ticket.\n\nTicket prices for most of Clark's games this season will be expensive, and understandably so. The demand to watch the NCAA's all-time leading scorer is very strong right now.\n\nEarlier this month, Clark acknowledged there'll be a ton of pressure on her to perform in front of the fans. That's something she'll embrace.\n\n\"I think no matter what happens there's going to be expectations and pressure on my shoulders and pressure on this team to be really good. That's how you want it,\" Clark said, via the Associated Press. \"We wouldn't want anything else. We want people showing up to our games, people expecting us to win a lot of basketball games this year and I'm expecting myself to play really well. I don't think it's anything that's ever been different for me.\"\n\nClark will be in action this evening against the Atlanta Dream.

'Full Court Press,' showing what it was like on the other side of the fence.\n\nFor Clark, this was a special time in her life, and she's glad to be a part of the docuseries featuring her last year with the Iowa Hawkeyes along with her counterparts Kamilla Cardoso and Kiki Rice.\n\n\"One of the main reasons I wanted to participate and do this is because I knew going into this, whether it was

Everything else will figure itself out.\" Sabrina is one of Clark's idols and also dons the hat of a mentor for the Fever rookie. Days before she advised Clark on the new journey, the Liberty star heaped praise on Clark. She also explained how her relationship with Clark has grown over the past few years and now they're entering into a new territory together.\n\nAnalyst Khristina Williams uploaded a clip of Sabrina Ionescu talking about the newest star on the block. The two-time WNBA All-Star said that she has a great relationship with Clark but more importantly, she is a fan of how she has made the game bigger even before making the major league debut,\n\n\"How she's been able to push the game forward is amazing and doing that in college and breaking so many records and knowing that she's just scratching the surface of what she's gonna accomplish in the league.\"\n\nHowever, she also made it clear that there will be an element of competition between them, but that doesn't mean that Clark can't reach out to her when she needs help. Moreover, Clark cited Ionescu as her player comparison on draft night, so it's understandable that this love and support from one of her idols will help her navigate this new domain.\n\nNow that they are competing in the same league, it'll be exciting for fans to see the mentor-mentee duo clash on the court. More importantly, it's not all serious talks between them as Ionescu is also a very generous mentor.\n\nEven though Clark couldn't win the NCAA trophy, leaving her stellar college career on an unfinished note, the Iowa Hawkeyes star became the most popular star at the collegiate level. From superstar musicians to pro ballers, everyone wanted to be a witness to the Caitlin Clark phenomenon when she was running things in the NCAA.\n\nIonescu and Clark are two of the most impactful players in the league and the latter has just begun. After the Liberty sharpshooter competed with Stephen Curry in the All-Star weekend, there have been talks about the effectiveness of the WNBA. Adding Clark's on-court charm, safe to say that it's only upward from here for the league.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/14c60481-untitled-design-2024-05-08t234613.225.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Angel Reese Met Gala appearance invites proclamation from Cardi B about her role model status in WNBA\n\nIn less than a month since being drafted into the WNBA, Caitlin Clark and her rookie counterparts are already reshaping the landscape of women's professional basketball. The impact of these newcomers is reverberating throughout the league, catalyzing significant transformations both on and off the court.\n\nClark, hailed as the primary catalyst of this rookie class, has been a lightning rod for change since joining the Indiana Fever. Her veteran teammates, accustomed to playing in front of sparse crowds in outdated facilities, now find themselves selling out NBA arenas, a testament to the newfound attention and excitement surrounding the team.\n\nYet, amidst their rising stardom, the rookies have shed light on a critical issue plaguing the WNBA: travel conditions. A viral video depicting Clark navigating a commercial flight alongside fellow rookies Aliyah Boston and others underscored the stark reality of their transportation arrangements. While commercial travel has been the norm for some time, the sight of WNBA players squeezed into economy seats and retrieving their bags from baggage claim struck a chord, highlighting the stark disparity compared to their NBA counterparts.\n\nClark, ever the vocal advocate, addressed the issue head-on, calling for improvements in travel conditions as part of the next Collective Bargaining Agreement. Her advocacy has sparked conversations within the league, with efforts already underway to address the pressing issue of travel.\n\nHowever, Clark is not alone in driving this change. Angel Reese, Cam Brink, Rickea Jackson, Jacy Sheldon, Kamilla Cardoso, and other members of the rookie class are equally instrumental in propelling the WNBA forward. Their collective impact extends beyond the court, fueling increased interest and enthusiasm for the league as a whole.\n\nAs discussions surrounding travel conditions gain momentum, it is Clark's international superstar status and unwavering advocacy that have propelled the issue to the forefront of the WNBA agenda. With the support of her fellow rookies and the league's commitment to progress, the future of women's professional basketball looks brighter than ever before.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacy_Sheldon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacy Sheldon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickea_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickea Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/360a2d6e23f15be93045d4939a7f96c0/crop/19x8/1978x1314/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/08/17151210559427.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

I'm looking forward to watching her.\"\n\nAs Manning noted, Clark appeared on his alternative ESPN2 telecast when the Chiefs notched a Week 11 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. She explained that she grew up in a family of Chiefs fans and would take annual trips to games with cousins who lived in Kansas City.\n\n\"I'm not a bandwagon Chiefs fan,\" Clark assured the Manning brothers. \"I was a Chiefs fan even when they weren't good.\"\n\nBefore Manning could feel too hurt about the Des Moines native choosing Kansas City over the Colts, Clark said she was also a \"huge\" Manning fan and owned his jersey.

Let's begin with the award that seems to have the biggest frontrunner in quite some time: Rookie of the Year.\n\nIs Caitlin Clark a sure thing? Who might steal the honor from the Indiana Fever guard?\n\nThis award is Caitlin Clark's to lose. She averaged a monstrous 31.7 points per game in her final season at Iowa and was drafted at the No. 1 spot in the 2024 WNBA Draft due to her ability to dominate a game single-handedly.\n\nShe lived up to the hype in her preseason debut for the Indiana Fever, scoring 21 points in her 28 minutes of play. It wasn't enough to get Indiana the win as they lost 79-76 to the Dallas Wings, but it demonstrated how good she will be in this league.\n\nLast season, Clark's new teammate, Aliyah Boston, was voted the unanimous Rookie of the Year. Clark has a great chance of ensuring that the award stays in Indiana for another year.\n\nCameron Brink has a golden opportunity to take the keys to the Los Angeles Sparks and usher in a new era. With iconic bigs like Candace Parker and Nneka Ogwumike etched into LA history, the expectation is there for Brink to carry on that legacy.\n\nThe collegiate Defensive Player of the Year should get plenty of opportunities to establish herself as the bona fide starter. If she scores enough and stays healthy, she'll have a great chance of winning the award.\n\nAngel Reese already has had some exciting moments during her rookie preseason with the Chicago Sky. She had an incredible 24 hours, attending the Met Gala and then following that up with a 13-point performance in the Sky's 101-53 thrashing of the New York Liberty in preseason action.\n\nAfter the game, she showed that she has swagger on the court, the runway and the social media streets, getting chippy at anyone who might not like her way of doing things.\n\nIt's not just bark but bite with Reese, and given her ability and opportunity for heavy minutes in Chicago, she will have a chance to make enough noise to be in the running for Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe odds are that, barring injury, Clark will win this award with ease. But that doesn't make the award or this new class of players any less exciting. They've already caused a huge spark in interest, and if these early moments are any indication, the best of this class is yet to come as the 2024 WNBA season kicks off.", "source": {"uri": "swishappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swish Appeal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edwin_garcia@swishappeal.com", "name": "Edwin Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors_and_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors and Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t1qT_U0JqSc-4hqzJJeU710HetM=/0x0:6000x3000/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25439544/2151504350.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

That's a popular question being asked this month.\n\nClark was invited to USA Basketball training camp in April, but she was unable to go because Iowa made it to the Final Four.\n\nAlthough it's not a guarantee, Lindsay Schnell of USA TODAY expects Clark to make Team USA's roster for the 2024 Olympics.\n\nHere's what Schnell wrote about Clark:\n\nDoes this seem like that much of a stretch? No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark is the biggest name and face in the women's game right now, so putting her on the Olympic team, even if she doesn't play much, seems inevitable.

However, regarding the best shooter currently employed by an Indianapolis sports team, Miller says it may be Indiana Fever rookie phenom Caitlin Clark.\n\nOn \"The Dan Patrick Show,\" Dan Patrick recalled his recent conversation with Pacers coach Rick Carlisle regarding Indianapolis' top 3-point shooter. He noted that Carlisle chose Pacers star point guard Tyrese Haliburton over Clark, who made her WNBA preseason debut on Friday.\n\nThe veteran coach also quipped that 67-year-old Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird, who rejoined Indiana as a consultant in the offseason, also has a case. Carlisle added that the uber-confident Bird probably still considers himself Indianapolis' No. 1 shooter.\n\nPatrick later got Miller, who leads the Pacers with 2,560 career 3s, to weigh in on the debate. He asked the Hall of Famer who he would take in a 3-point shootout between Clark and Haliburton. He also threw Bird in as an option for good measure.\n\nMiller appeared torn between Clark and Haliburton before opting with the Fever rookie, citing the Pacers star's recent shooting struggles.\n\n\"Right now, I would probably -- Well, see, I will say this. Tyrese has been struggling with his 3-point shot since the All-Star break. I've been doing my homework. -- So, I might go with Caitlin.

He was on track to do so again this year. However, as Reggie Miller alluded to, he hasn't been the same since sustaining a midseason hamstring injury.\n\nOver 26 regular-season games after the All-Star break, Haliburton shot only 30.3% from 3 on 7.5 attempts per game. In contrast, he shot 40.0% from deep on 7.9 attempts per game over his first 43 appearances.\n\nHaliburton's shooting woes have extended into the playoffs, where the two-time All-Star is shooting only 30.5% on 8.4 3-point attempts per game through seven outings.\n\nConversely, Caitlin Clark enters her WNBA rookie season coming off a dominant senior college basketball season with the Iowa Hawkeyes. Over 39 contests, Clark shot 37.8% from 3 on a whopping 13.6 attempts per game. With 201 made 3s for the season, she set the NCAA Division 1's all-time 3-point record.\n\nAdditionally, during Friday's preseason debut against the Dallas Wings, Clark shot 5-for-13 (38.5%) from long distance, needing little time to adjust.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Clark can maintain her elite 3-point shooting for an entire WNBA season. Likewise, it's unclear when Haliburton will bust out of his shooting slump.\n\nHowever, as of now, there appears to be a legitimate debate regarding who is Indianapolis' premier shooter.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristan_rawcliffe@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tristan Rawcliffe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(sportscaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/3978a-17151605563707-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546993", "eventUri": "eng-9546993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

At the same time, it would definitely draw attention to the team because of her white-hot publicity.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, the roster for the women's basketball Olympic team will be announced in June.\n\nClark was asked whether she wants to be on the Olympic team during her April 17 introductory press conference for the Indiana Fever. Asked how important it is for her to make the team, she said being chosen for the Olympics was a dream but then revealed, \"I actually still need to earn my degree.\"\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the best 12 players will be chosen for the U.S. Olympic team. The site reported that the team is likely to be filled with some veteran players, noting that some other countries have \"had the same core\" for years.\n\nAccording to the Athletic, putting Clark on the team \"could be a polarizing decision\" because she wasn't in a senior team camp and others might be \"snubbed\" as a result. She would \"bring attention\" to the team, though, The Athletic noted. The Athletic did not list Clark among the players considered \"locks\" like A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart, but added that she might be a good addition as \"a switch-up point guard and a 3-point specialist.\"\n\n\"In college, I always said my main focus is on basketball.

You can't script it any better.\"\n\nClark made it clear she would love to be selected for the Olympic team, but she also made it clear she knows it's not a sure thing.\n\n\"Obviously, I would love to be on the Olympic team, and be in Paris in 2024,\" Clark said during the press conference. \"But that's not up to me. I think just going about my business and doing exactly what I have done my entire career is the most important thing. Obviously, my focus is completely here too. I actually still need to earn my degree, too; I need to graduate college first, or else my mom might kill me.\"\n\nShe laughed at that point, adding, \"No, I think that's a dream. You grow up watching the Summer Olympics; to me, it's better than the Winter Olympics. I want to be on that team. I want to be an Olympic gold medalist one day.

The rise in popularity has driven more betting action on WNBA odds which means sportsbooks are accommodating this uptick in interest with the largest menu of WNBA futures and props as we count down the days to the 2024 season. And with just 12 teams in the league, it's a bit easier to stay in the know.\n\nThe Atlanta Dream have an offense that can run with any team in the WNBA when it's clicking. Last season, it was tough to tell when that was. Atlanta was by far the most inconsistent team in the league and backed into the postseason playing poor basketball. Yet, it still won 19 games.\n\nRhyne Howard, Allisha Gray, and Cheyenne Parker-Tyus are a handful and the club just added guard Crystal Dangerfield to bolster a backcourt that features veteran Jordin Canada, who could miss the start of the season with a hand injury. Atlanta also rolled the dice on a 35-year-old former MVP Tina Charles, who hasn't played since 2022.\n\nThe Dream have an easier road in the East and my WNBA power ratings pan out to another 19-20 win campaign, which is more than enough to get Over the shorter ask of 17.5 victories. Some books are dealing Atlanta at 18.5 wins with the Over at -113.\n\nPick: Over 17.5 wins (-117 at DraftKings)\n\nThis is a \"shop around\" prop that requires you to have a FanDuel account. At that book, the Chicago Sky are priced at -350 to miss the playoff cut, which seems like a pricy ask for some bettors until you look at what other shops are dealing. The Sky to miss the playoffs is listed as high as -600 at other mainstream books. We're talking almost half off here!\n\nChicago has plenty of potential, especially after drafting top-tier forwards Kamilla Cardoso and Angel Reese. But those two thrived on bullying their way to the basket and dominating the boards against smaller college foes. The pro-level pushes back and Cardoso is already down four to six weeks with a shoulder injury. Second-round pick Brynna Maxwell is also out for a similar stint due to a knee injury.\n\nChicago was the last team to qualify for the playoffs in 2023, needing 18 wins to squeak in. Veterans Kahleah Copper, Alanna Smith, Courtney Williams, and Rebekah Gardner are all gone from that roster and the Sky have a new coach in women's great Teresa Weatherspoon. I have Chicago pegged for 11 or 12 wins at best, which will get it another Top 3 pick but not a spot in the tournament.\n\nPick: No Playoffs (-350 at FanDuel)\n\nThe Connecticut Sun are big favorites to make the postseason and anything but a ticket on Las Vegas or New York to win the title is \"dead money\". So that leaves us with the season-win total. Connecticut posted 27 victories in 2023 but this isn't the same squad as last year.\n\nAmongst this league-wide injection in youth, the Sun are only getting older. Two of their three top scorers are 32-plus (Alyssa Thomas and DeWanna Bonner), Brionna Jones is coming back slow from an Achilles tear, and Tiffany Hayes retired. Connecticut also has a revamped backcourt with news faces Tiffany Mitchell and Moriah Jefferson needing to gel immediately with the core group.\n\nWin totals differ depending on where you bet, sitting as high as 25.5 and as low as 23.5 O/U. The high end of my season projection is 25 wins for the Sun, but that doesn't account for the stress a compressed schedule will put on this veteran group - most notably in the second half of the summer. Connecticut was 15-5 SU before the All-Star break in 2023 but finished 12-8 SU.\n\nPick: Under 25.5 wins (-115 at BetMGM)\n\nThe Dallas Wings will start the season without do-it-all forward Satou Sabally, who's the glue for the Wings and helped push this team to 22 wins and a strong playoff showing in 2023. Sabally plans to return after the Olympic break, leaving a huge hole in this roster until then.\n\nArike Ogunbowale is one of the most electric scorers in the WNBA and is backed up by a big frontcourt featuring Natasha Howard, Teaira McCown, and Kalani Brown. But there's nothing in between. With no perimeter threats beyond Arike, rival defenses can pack the paint and play over the pick-and-roll.\n\nThe Wings find themselves in a very competitive West, with Las Vegas, Seattle, Minnesota, and a revamped Phoenix roster making regular dates. My projections sit right on this win total, but I'll take the plus-money on Under 20.5 knowing Dallas will be in deep for the first two and a half months.\n\nPick: Under 20.5 wins (+100 at DraftKings)\n\nCaitlin Clark's arrival signals a massive shift for the league, as evidenced by the \"Caitlin Clark odds\" made available for betting by many sportsbooks. No other WNBA player has futures on their season-long output.\n\nThe WNBA was already seeing a 3-point renaissance long before Clark was lighting it up from long-range at Iowa. Last season, Sabrina Ionescu set a league record with 128 made triples and Clark will get the opportunity to surpass that in her rookie year. My projections come in between 140 and 152 makes from distance - varying on games played.\n\nI opted for this player prop rather than any of Indiana's futures because of the unknown. Clark will give the Fever a shot in the arm, but are the offseason odds overhyped? I do have Indiana in line for 20 wins and a playoff spot if you're willing to lay a little more on that \"Yes\" prop (ranges from -250 to -310)\n\nPick: Caitlin Clark Over 130 3-Pointers (-110 at bet365)\n\nThe Las Vegas Aces go for the threepeat in 2024 but like all dynasties, the regular season becomes a bit blas\u00e9. Las Vegas knows it will qualify for the postseason, so the emphasis is protecting its players and peaking at the perfect time.\n\nThis year is a bit more difficult due to the Olympic break, which compounds the schedule - especially in the second half of the summer. On top of that, the formation of \"superteams\" like the Aces and Liberty have prompted other franchises to go big, with Western rivals Seattle and Phoenix loading up for a shot at the champs.\n\nLas Vegas' win total is down to 32.5 victories at some books, which would be two wins less than the 34 last year. The Aces are absolutely capable of topping the 2024 total but with coach Becky Hammond pacing her players (many of which will be playing for Team USA), Vegas will leave a little left in the tank for the playoffs.\n\nPick: Under 33.5 Wins (-140 at bet365)\n\nNobody knows what to expect from the Los Angeles Sparks in 2024. The season win total markets range from 9.5 to 11.5 O/U. What we do know is that Curt Miller will be on the sideline for Los Angeles, and that could be enough to get this team Over 10 wins.\n\nMiller made miracles happen for the snake-bitten Sparks in 2023, winning 17 games with 18 different starting lineups. His 2024 roster looks very different, losing Ogwumike and Canada, but drafting the future of the franchise in Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson with picks No. 2 and No. 4.\n\nThose rookies need to grow up fast but helping them out is a very deep roster, due in part to all of last year's ailments and the additions of Kia Nurse and Aari McDonald. Getting 10 wins isn't asking the world (hell, Phoenix won nine games last summer), and that still allows L.A. to suck just enough for a Top 3 pick in the 2025 draft.\n\nPick: Over 9.5 (-139 at BetMGM)\n\nIf you've been reading my WNBA content in the ramp-up to the season, you know I'm \"ride or die\" with the Minnesota Lynx in 2024. Minnesota is coming off a solid 2023 campaign in which it won 19 games after a 0-6 start, Napheesa Collier emerged among the WNBA elite, and the Lynx qualified for the tournament.\n\nFor some reason, however, bookmakers aren't buying into Minnesota to continue that momentum this summer. I think a lot of it has to do with the moves made by Seattle and Phoenix, rather than actually projecting poor results from the Lynx.\n\nThe front office made excellent offseason moves, building one of the deepest backcourts in the league, and have youngsters like Diamond Miller and Dorka Juhasz ready to make the leap in their second year. My model says Minnesota will flirt with 20 wins and a potential No. 3 spot in the West.\n\nPick: Over 16.5 wins (-130 at DraftKings)\n\nThe New York Liberty won 32 games last season and really found its form in the second half of the schedule, as the revamped roster started to come together. The Liberty boasted a +12.9 point differential over their final 15 games, winning 11 of those outings.\n\nNot only will they have better cohesion out of the gate in 2024 but the Eastern Conference isn't as tight as the West. The Liberty will face a softer slate of foes, taking on bottom-tier teams like Washington and Chicago four times each (that could get N.Y. a quarter of the way there).\n\nUnlike the Aces, New York will put importance on seeding and if it's going to avoid another embarrassing loss to Vegas in the finals, it'll need home-court. The Liberty's win total ranges from 29.5 to 31.5 wins across the market, while my season projection is another 32 victories for the Liberty.\n\nWith a win total hovering around .500 and some new faces on the Pheonix Mercury roster, a postseason ticket seems to be in the cards for Phoenix following a disastrous 9-31 campaign last summer. You may want to pump the breaks on that bet, however.\n\nThe Mercury brought in Kaleah Copper, Natasha Cloud, Rebecca Allen, and Morgan Bertsch, giving support to tent poles Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner in the twilight of their careers. Oh, and let's not forget Copper and returning guard Sophie Cunnigham already hate each other. That's a lot of chemistry to cook up with a brand-new coach in Nate Tibbetts at the wheel.\n\nThe season win total for Phoenix sits as low as 18.5 wins, which is right on the postseason cutoff from last summer. And this prop was as high as +280 at some books just last week, before getting bet down to +200 at those same shops.\n\nPick: No Playoffs (+260 at bet365)\n\nThe Seattle Storm didn't stay down long and immediately tossed their hat in the ring with the addition of Skylar Diggins-Smith and Nneka Ogwumike this offseason. Putting those veterans alongside Jewel Loyd, Ezi Magbegor, and Jordan Horston gives Seattle a starting five that can run with the Aces and Liberty... on paper.\n\nAdding all that talent up to 25 wins isn't as simple. Much like the Liberty's retooled roster in 2023, the Storm are going to need time to figure out just who's doing what. That slow start could sour their season win total chance right out of the gate. Personally, I'll be looking to bet against Seattle's spreads in the early workings of the schedule.\n\nI have the Storm pegged for 23 wins, tempering my expectation due to the overhaul, a lack of depth, and a tougher path in the Western Conference that sends Vegas, Dallas, Phoenix, and Minnesota to Seattle for four games apiece. That said, once they do iron out the wrinkles, the Storm will rain on someone's parade this postseason.\n\nPick: Under 24.5 wins (+105 at BetMGM)\n\nWhen comparing rosters across the league, the Washington Mystics don't measure up. For one, veteran star Elena Delle Donne is sitting out this season, erasing one of the most impactful players in the WNBA from the Mystics' makeup.\n\nWashington is admittedly in a rebuild, not only missing EDD but watching mainstay Natasha Cloud leave for Phoenix. That puts pressure on Brittney Sykes and Ariel Atkins to score more as well as adds weight to Shakira Austin and her health issues.\n\nI think the Mystics can be very strong defensively, especially with No. 6 Aaliyah Edwards inside, but Washington will struggle to score without a go-to option when the shot clock ticks down. I'll be looking to bet Mystics Unders in the early workings of the schedule and project this team to flirt with nine or 10 wins.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The much-hyped game was originally scheduled for Friday night, but it was moved up one day due to the Pacers' needing the venue to host the Knicks in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series in the NBA playoffs.\n\nThere are no more schedule conflicts for the remainder of the Indiana-New York series, but if the Pacers are to rally from an early 2-0 deficit, a trip to the Eastern Conference finals could potentially disrupt Fever home games scheduled for May 28, May 30, and June 1. While bumping a preseason game up 24 hours didn't appear to cause any big issues, interfering with regular-season games early into Clark's rookie season would certainly create headaches for both the NBA and WNBA on a team and league level.\n\nIt's all a sign that the continued rise of interest in the WNBA presents yet another wrinkle in the busy springtime happenings at arenas that are already juggling NBA and NHL postseason games on short notice, in addition to previously scheduled concerts and other events.\n\nThe Fever are one of six WNBA teams to share their full-time arena with an NBA or NHL team, and, this month, they have road games scheduled at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, Seattle's Climate Pledge Arena, and Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. The NHL's Kraken and Kings both made the playoffs but have since been eliminated. Meanwhile, the Las Vegas Aces and Washington Mystics have each decided to move one home game against Indiana later this season into larger NHL and NBA arenas in their respective cities.\n\nOutside of the start of the WNBA season, four venues in particular are still juggling busy schedules in the second rounds of the NBA and NHL playoffs: Madison Square Garden, Boston's TD Garden, American Airlines Arena in Dallas, and Denver's Ball Arena. While operators are used to quick turnaround routinely during the regular season, the postseason presents a unique challenge as schedules aren't officially set until teams advance to the next round.",

Learn more\n\nWhile the NBA season may be coming to a close, the WNBA season is just getting started -- and the Indiana Fever is the team to watch this year. We'll show you everything you need to know about how to get Indiana Fever tickets, including a full home and away game schedule.\n\nDespite finishing last in the Eastern Conference for the past two years, the Indiana Fever has upped its status in the past month by drafting college basketball star Caitlin Clark. Clark made waves in her four-year collegiate career at Iowa when she broke the men's and women's NCAA Division 1 shooting records. She joins stars like Kelsey Mitchell, NaLyssa Smith, and 2023 WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston on the Indiana Fever this season.\n\nHere's our breakdown of the anticipated Indiana Fever season schedule, purchasing details, and original and resale ticket prices. You can also check out resale tickets through sites like Vivid Seats and StubHub.\n\nThe Indiana Fever's regular season will run from May 14 to September 19. They'll start the season with a game against the Connecticut Sun in Uncasville, CT, and end it with a game against the Washington Mystics in Washington, DC. The table below features the cheapest starting prices for Indiana Fever tickets on Vivid Seats at the time of writing.\n\nOriginal standard tickets to Indiana Fever games are sold through Ticketmaster. Many of the best seats near the court have already sold, and most of the remaining original tickets are seated pretty far back. Resale sites like Vivid Seats and StubHub also have several ticket listings, and they tend to offer more variety in pricing and seating options.\n\nOriginal standard Indiana Fever tickets range in price depending on the date, opposing team, and venue. The cheapest home game tickets in the very back of the Gainbridge Fieldhouse tend to go for about $15 on Ticketmaster. On Vivid Seats, the cheapest resale listings start at $8 for the Connecticut Sun game on May 20 in Indianapolis, IN. On StubHub, the cheapest listings for this date start from $7. Home game starting ticket prices happen to be a little cheaper than most away games, for both original and resale ticket listings.\n\nThe most expensive game is shaping up to be the Chicago Sky match-up in Chicago on June 23. The only remaining original standard tickets for the game go for $1,050. You'll have better luck on the resale market for this date, with tickets starting at $259 and $287 on Vivid Seats and StubHub, respectively. Overall, the cheapest Indiana Fever resale listings range in price from about $10 to $250, with an average of about $125.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Fever to open arena's 3rd deck vs Atlanta", "body": "By MICHAEL MAROT - AP Sports Writer\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd of 17,000 that believe the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\nA little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court.

Fever to open arena's 3rd deck vs Atlanta", "body": "By MICHAEL MAROT - AP Sports Writer\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark spent Wednesday practicing inside an empty Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nOn Thursday night, Indianapolis' new game-changing rock star will be welcomed by a raucous, near sellout crowd of 17,000 that believe the WNBA's No. 1 overall pick can instantly change the Indiana Fever's fortunes.\n\nA little more than a month after leading Iowa to its second straight NCAA championship game, Clark will make her Fever home debut in a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"People definitely know who I am,\" Clark said Wednesday. \"Sometimes it's hard to go out and do what I want to do, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the best way to grow women's basketball. That's the best way to get these fans excited about what we're going to do here, so I think people they are just as excited as we are to play here. So I think more than anything, enjoy it, soak it in.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nClark's mere presence already has made a difference. In the preseason opener Friday night at Dallas, she scored a team-high 21 points in a 79-76 loss in front of another near sellout. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 games televised nationally and her regular-season debut May 14 at Connecticut will be the first live sporting event streamed on Disney+.\n\nCloser to home, the Fever will open up the third deck of their home arena rather than having seating in only the two lower decks. The change means Indiana could draw more than 17,000 fans to a preseason game that was moved up a day because of the NBA playoffs. The Indiana Pacers will host the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal Friday night.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFever officials wouldn't say Wednesday how many tickets were still available -- only that there was a limited amount. And yet they could still have a sellout for the most anticipated home debut for an Indiana athlete since Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck.\n\nFor Clark, playing in front of full arena has become the norm. For her teammates and coaches, this could be the start of something bigger than they could have imagined.\n\n\"This is what women's basketball has always been about,\" said Aliyah Boston, the WNBA's 2023 rookie of the year. \"I think it's really great that fans are following their favorite players from college into the league because that's the way we continue to grow.\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to a generational-type player such as Clark, who has fully embraced her new home city.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm expecting a lot of people to be here, I'm expecting it to be loud, I'm expecting the fans to be really in it,\" Clark said. \"Like I know these fans are going to show up, and they know what's going to be going on on the court. I think sometimes you can show up to arenas and they're just sitting there. But like when I was in college, they were invested, they know what's going on.\n\n\"I think it's the same thing in the state of Indiana, people that support the Fever, that support the Pacers, they're invested.

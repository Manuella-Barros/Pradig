MSC, a Geneva-based cruise line, confirmed the incident \"with deep regret\" in a statement and said it had immediately notified authorities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Law Enforcement is investigating.\n\nOn Wednesday, the whale was towed to Sandy Hook, N.J., for a necropsy. According to NOAA, officials discovered broken bones in the right flipper, tissue trauma in the right shoulder blade region and a belly full of food. Biologists took samples for biotoxin and histopathologic analyses. NOAA spokeswoman Andrea Gomez said the tissue and bone samples can help biologists determine whether the whale died before the collision with the ship or because of it.\n\nThe Atlantic Marine Conservation Society is leading the whale examination. Results from the exam could take days to weeks, said Kathleen Collins, senior marine campaign manager with the International Fund for Animal Welfare.\n\nBased on the findings released so far, Andy Rogan, science manager at Ocean Alliance, a whale research and conservation nonprofit, said the cruise ship probably caused the whale's demise. If so, it would have been a sudden death.\n\n\"Whales are huge animals, but compared to a ship that size, it's still a massive impact. So much weight and power is hitting that whale,\" he said. \"It's almost certain that a ship strike killed that whale.\"\n\nAccording to NOAA, vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are the biggest threats to sei whales, an endangered species that inhabits deeper waters off the coastline. Population figures are elusive, but NOAA documented roughly 6,300 sei whales between Florida and Nova Scotia from 2010 to 2013.\n\nSei whales are feeding during this time of year, and Collins said the whales eat on the surface, placing them in the potential bull's eye for collisions with a ship's bow. She said crew members and passengers might not have felt the bump because of the ship's size. The MSC Meraviglia weighs 171,598 tons; sei whales weigh up to 50 tons.\n\n\"It really is a tragic case where this strike likely happened and everyone was oblivious until they came into port,\" Collins said. \"They likely don't even know exactly where they struck the whale, either.\"\n\nNOAA urges boaters operating along the East Coast to cruise slowly, stay alert and report any sightings of right whales or dead, injured or entangled whales. In its statement, MSC said it follows comprehensive measures to avoid accidents with marine life, such as training deck officers with the Ocean Research & Conservation Association and adjusting itineraries in regions populated by whales.\n\nCollins said voluntarily reducing vessel speeds can help avoid run-ins. However, she said, cruise ships and large tankers prefer to move briskly because they are on tight schedules.\n\nThe Cruise Lines International Association did not respond to a request for comment on the industry's safety protocols.\n\n\"The chance of mortality with a vessel strike goes down pretty substantially as you reduce the vessel speed,\" Collins said.\n\nSpotters on deck also would help a cruise ship avoid a whale, she said. Such crew members are trained to look specifically for whales in key locations. Marine outlets, agencies such as the Coast Guard and the Whale Alert app share information about whale sightings and locations.\n\nRogan said there is no \"silver bullet\" for ships to avoid whales, but advances in technology can help lower the threat. He said hydrophones can pick up whale acoustics, information that NOAA could then disseminate to vessels. At a recent workshop, Rogan said, he learned about infrared cameras that can detect whales within a 360-degree range, particularly in front of a vessel.\n\nRogan urged the public Thursday to share its outrage about the incident with government agencies and with the cruise line. Collins said she hoped the incident would inspire the cruise industry to act as a better steward in the waters it shares with vulnerable marine life.\n\nThe MSC Meraviglia, she noted, is headed next to Canada, a critical ground for North Atlantic right whales, including mothers and their newborn calves.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"},

Last season's count was the lowest since 1971-72.\n\nResearchers have been counting whales during their southward migration since 1967 and use three months of visual surveys along the central California coast that are plugged into a formula used and refined for decades.\n\nBut a spokesman for NOAA Fisheries cautioned against reading too much into one year's dramatic increase.\n\n\"People shouldn't get too hung up on the 33% specifically but more importantly see that the numbers are increasing,\" said NOAA spokesman Michael Milstein. \"The numbers are trending up. The indications are consistent that the whales have gone from a decline to a recovery.\"\n\nThat's good news for scientists and whale enthusiast along the Oregon, Washington and California coasts.\n\nThe recovery is evident enough that NOAA officially declared an end to its five-year investigation into why many north Pacific gray whales appeared undernourished and why strandings increased starting in 2018.\n\nNOAA's investigation began in 2019 after hundreds of gray whales stranded along the Pacific coast from Mexico to Alaska, including in whales in their wintering, migratory, and feeding areas.\n\nThere was a roughly 40% decline in the gray whale population, leading to the official designation of an \"unusual mortality event\" which then triggered a required effort to understand why it was happening.\n\nThe mortality event occurred between December 2018 through last November, with peak strandings occurring during a two-year period ending in December 2020. There were 690 gray whale strandings, including 347 in the United States, 316 in Mexico, and 27 in Canada.\n\n\"While the number of strandings spiked at the start of the unusual mortality event, they have since declined to annual numbers similar to those recorded before the event began,\" NOAA Fisheries said in a statement. \"The number of calves born to the population also appears to be improving, with other signs that the population may have begun to recover.\"\n\nThe number of calves born in 2022 was estimated at 217, down from about 950 in 2018. NOAA researchers estimate that 412 female gray whales swam north last year -- nearly twice the 2022 count. Still, that number was far below the estimate of roughly 1,500 gray whale calves in 2016.\n\nNOAA said the decline in gray whale numbers during from 2018 to 2023 resembled a similar but shorter decline between 1999 and 2000. The population rebounded in the following years eventually reaching a recent height of 27,500 whales in 2015-16 before declining again in 2019-20.\n\n\"We know the population has demonstrated strong resilience in the past, and we will be watching to ensure we know how the whales recover from this unusual mortality event,\" said Deborah Fauquier, NOAA's coordinator of the investigation.\n\nStudies of dead whales supported malnutrition as a common cause of death and did not identify other causes or infections. NOAA investigators concluded that localized ecosystem changes, including both access to and the quality of prey, in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas contributed to the poor nutritional condition observed in live and stranded gray whales.\n\nKiller whale predation, entanglement in fishing nets, biotoxins and collisions with vessels also contributed to gray whale deaths. But these factors were not as significant as malnutrition, researchers said.\n\nNOAA said marine mammal stranding networks in the United States, Canada and Mexico will continue to respond to whale stranding reports this year and collect samples when feasible.\n\n'Carrying capacity'\n\nGray whales were hunted to near extinction during the whaling era, but with the protections of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, the animals have recovered to the point where they were removed from endangered species protection in 1994.\n\nThe whales migrate in the spring from the warm waters of Mexico's Baja peninsula to the icy waters of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, where they feed until they return to Mexico in the fall to birth their calves.\n\nThe kind of dramatic die-off that started in 2018 also occurred 1999-2000 and two other times in the early 1990s, said John Calambokidis, researching biologist and part of the group that investigated the recent unusual event.\n\nWhen the whale population reaches limits of the environment's carrying capacity, there would be a decrease in the reproductive rate and a slight increase in the mortality rate that would bring the population to a plateau, Calambokidis told Los Angeles Times.\n\nGray whales seem to have gone through these more dramatic vacillations, he said, enduring three periods of major mortality rates and rebounding before the most recent five-year event.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Daily Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\n\nMSC Cruises' MSC Meraviglia sadly arrived in New York with a deceased whale trapped on its bow bulb on Saturday, May 4, following a 6-night cruise to Bermuda. It is unknown whether the ship impacted and killed the whale, or simply contacted the already deceased animal and unfortunately toted it along.\n\nThe whale has been identified as a mature female sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis), the third-largest type of baleen whale in the world. This particular whale measured 44 feet long, though full-grown sei whales can reach 56-64 feet in length. The species is listed as officially endangered.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, sei whales can reach speeds over 34 miles per hour - faster than MSC Meraviglia's top cruising speed of 26 mph.\n\n\"We immediately notified the relevant authorities, who are now conducting an examination of the whale,\" cruise line officials stated. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of any marine life.\"\n\nThe dead whale was towed from the Port of Brooklyn to Sandy Hook, New Jersey - just across Raritan Bay. There the cetacean was examined and a necropsy performed to help determine the cause of death and whether the cruise ship contributed to the animal's demise.\n\nPreliminary study from the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society showed tissue trama along the whale's right shoulder blade and a right flipper fracture, as well as relatively fresh food in its stomach. This may indicate the whale was feeding at its time of death.\n\nNOAA's Office of Law Enforcement is also investigating the incident in relation to the whale's death and whether MSC Cruises is at fault.\n\n\"All dolphins, porpoises, and whales are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which makes touching, feeding, or otherwise harming these animals illegal,\" the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society noted.\n\nTo be clear, it is not yet confirmed whether or not the cruise ship caused the whale's death, or if the vessel simply impacted the body in such a way as to snag it and carry it along.\n\nToxicological tests will be performed on samples of the whale's organs to determine if any pollution or contaminants are present, which will help further research on the species and what impacts its health.\n\nThe 171,598-gross-ton ship has already departed on her next voyage, an 8-night Canada and New England sailing with port visits to Newport, Boston, Portland, Saint John, and Halifax. MSC Meraviglia can welcome 4,428 travelers at double occupancy, or up to 5,642 guests when fully booked with all berths filled.\n\nAll cruise lines do take a variety of precautions to protect marine life, including whales. This includes following all established environmental protocols to minimize marine pollution that could contaminate critical habitats, as well as noise reduction protocols in sensitive areas.\n\nIn certain sailing regions or at certain times of year, particularly close to shore where whales are known to breed or migrate, sailing speeds are dramatically reduced to permit whales plenty of time to move out of the way of approaching vessels. Slower speeds also ensure better maneuverability for larger vessels to avoid coming to close to marine life.\n\n\"We have comprehensive measures in place to help avoid collisions, such as training all our deck officers with the Ocean Research & Conservation Association (ORCA) and we follow regulations designed to protect whales and other marine life,\" MSC Cruises said.\n\nRead Also: MSC Cruises Works to Reduce Chance of Ships Hitting Whales\n\nWhen protective measures are in place, cruise lines may adjust itineraries to ensure compliance with slower speed requirements. At times, ports of call may be cancelled if sailing speed will not permit a suitable visit.\n\nIt should be noted that sei whales are found worldwide, but usually prefer deeper waters further from coastlines. At this time, there is no way to determine where the whale died or how far it may have been moved by the cruise ship before arriving in New York.", "source": {"uri": "cruisehive.com", "dataType":

Donate today\n\nA cruise ship docked in Brooklyn over the weekend with a gruesome passenger pinned to its bow: a dead, 50,000-pound endangered sei whale.\n\nThe 44-foot adult female whale's death is the latest example of marine mammals being killed by maritime traffic. About 30 large whales were found dead along the New York and New Jersey coasts last year, according to the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society. Most showed signs of being struck by boats.\n\n\"While the investigation into the suspected cause of death for this sei whale is still ongoing, the risks to large whales from ship strikes remain a great concern in our region,\" wrote Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Ocean Giants Program at Wildlife Conservation Society, via email.\n\nThe dead whale was hauled from the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal to the beach in Sandy Hook, NJ. There, Atlantic Marine Conservation Society officials performed a necropsy that found the whale had a full stomach and was in good health. Further examination found that its right shoulder blade was injured and its right flipper was fractured, likely as a result of a ship strike. While the whale's official cause of death had not been determined, preliminary signs pointed to a ship collision.\n\nA spokesperson for the operator of the ship, MSC Cruises, said the company has protocols to avoid crashing into whales. Deck officers receive training on protecting marine life and the company sometimes alters its itineraries to avoid areas where whales have been spotted.\n\n\"On Saturday a whale was discovered on the bow of our ship as the vessel approached the port of New York,\" MSC Cruises spokesperson Sidney Sterling wrote in an email. \"We immediately notified the relevant authorities.\"\n\nTen years ago, a 45-foot female whale was hit by a Norwegian Cruise Line ship in the Hudson River. It's estimated that 20,000 whales die annually as a result of being struck by ships worldwide.\n\nNew York Harbor is home to the Atlantic Ocean's busiest U.S. port. Nearly 7.5 million containers come in and out of the harbor every year. About 40% of whale deaths on the East Coast are directly related to human interactions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says humpback whales have been dying in increasing numbers along the Atlantic coast since 2016 - a pattern the federal agency describes as an unusual mortality event.\n\n\"Cruise ships are a common cause of whale mortality around the world,\" wrote Danielle Brown, director of research at Gotham Whale. \"Whales feed inside the shipping channels that these vessels use to transit to and from ports in New York and New Jersey.\"\n\nLast month, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-New Jersey) sent a letter to the Departments of Commerce, Transportation and Homeland Security requesting that they enforce ship speed restrictions in the New York and New Jersey ports for vessels longer than 65 feet. Thirteen other congressmembers joined Pallone in expressing concern that increasing harbor traffic threatens migrating whales.\n\nWhile white-bellied sei whales usually live far off shore and away from busy ports, climate change has brought more whales closer to shore. According to NOAA, whales are affected by changing water temperatures and currents. Climate change negatively affects whale feeding behavior, stress levels and reproduction.\n\nAlthough sei whales are endangered due to historic whaling, their populations are unknown. Their diet includes plankton, small schooling fish and cephalopods such as squid. They are usually found in deep subtropical, temperate and subpolar waters, and spend the hot summer months in the Gulf of Maine.\n\nNOAA's Office of Law Enforcement is investigating this incident.\n\n\"Mariners operating along the U.S. East Coast are encouraged to slow their vessel speed, stay alert, and report any sightings of right whales or any dead, injured or entangled whales,\"

The sei whale is protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, NOAA's website reads. The overall number of these whales in American waters is not known, the website notes. (RELATED: Sperm Whales Battle Hunting Orcas With Cloud Of Diarrhea In Rarely Recorded Moment)\n\nDr. Howard Rosenbaum, director for the Wildlife Conservation Society's Ocean Giants Program, told the Brooklyn Paper that not much information was known about sei whales in New York and New Jersey. He reportedly added that acoustic detection revealed that they maintained a low-level presence in the area year round, with the largest number present from March to May.\n\n\"We immediately notified the relevant authorities, who are now conducting an examination of the whale,\" officials of MSC Cruises, which owns the MSC Meraviglia, the ship in question, said, the AP reported. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of any marine life,\" the officials reportedly added, emphasizing that the company follows regulations regarding whales.\n\nA necropsy was conducted on the whale Tuesday by the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society (AMCS), the organization said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"The necropsy examination (animal autopsy) revealed evidence of tissue trauma along the right shoulder blade region, and a right flipper fracture. The whale's gastrointestinal tract was also full of food. Most of the other organs were sampled as well for toxicology and other life history studies. Samples were collected and will be sent for histopathologic analysis. The tissue and bone samples collected will help biologists determine if the vessel interaction occurred pre or post mortem,\" the AMCS wrote.\n\nNOAA Gomez told the Brooklyn Paper via email that her agency encourages ships along the East Coast to slow down, remain alert and report any injured or deceased whales.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

We have comprehensive measures in place to help avoid collisions, such as training all our deck officers with the Ocean Research & Conservation Association (ORCA) and we follow regulations designed to protect whales and other marine life,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"This includes altering itineraries in certain regions to avoid whales and we will continue to evaluate and update our procedures with our partners and the authorities,\" the company said. After stopping at New York, the MSC Meraviglia sailed to ports in New England and Canada.\n\nSei whales are endangered and are typically observed in deeper waters far from the coastline, per a message shared by the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society on Facebook.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"NOAA's (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Office of Law Enforcement is investigating this incident. The whale was relocated and towed to shore at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, to allow for better access to heavy equipment and resources to conduct a necropsy,\" the post added.\n\nNOAA Fisheries' Andrea Gomez didn't immediately respond to PEOPLE when approached for comment.\n\nThe Atlantic Marine Conservation Society confirmed a \"necropsy examination (animal autopsy) revealed evidence of tissue trauma along the right shoulder blade region, and a right flipper fracture. The whale's gastrointestinal tract was also full of food.\"\n\n\"Most of the other organs were sampled as well for toxicology and other life history studies,\" the message added. \"The tissue and bone samples collected will help biologists determine if the vessel interaction occurred pre or post mortem,\"\n\nAccording to the NOAA's website, sei whales are fast swimmers that can reach speeds of over 34 miles per hour, adding that an average sei whale eats about 2,000 pounds of food per day.\n\n\"Vessel strikes and entanglement pose the biggest threat to sei whales today,\" the website stated.",

In the cold seas cradled by the region's labyrinthine fjords, \u00d3lafur reportedly came across an animal that would have dwarfed his open wooden boat -- a blue whale, the largest animal on record, known in the Icelandic language as steypirey\u00f0ur.\n\nJ\u00f3n Gu\u00f0mundsson, or J\u00f3n the Learned, the poet and scholar who recorded \u00d3lafur's story, called blue whales the \"best and holiest of all whales.\" For sailors who were in danger from other, more \"evil\" whales, Gu\u00f0mundsson wrote, \"it is good to seek shelter with the blue whale, if it is close at hand, and to stay as close to it as possible.\" He went on to explain that blue whales were typically calm animals whose size alone intimidated more dangerous sea creatures.\n\nBlue whales weren't just mythic protectors of medieval Icelanders, though -- increasing evidence suggests that they were also an important food source. When the massive whale surfaced next to \u00d3lafur's boat, the man thrust his homemade spear into the flesh of the whale. The spear would have been marked with \u00d3lafur's signature emblem, and if all went well, \u00d3lafur would wound the whale badly enough that it would wash up dead on a nearby shore. Whoever found it would know \u00d3lafur had dealt the deadly blow by the markings on the spear tip, and he could stake his claim on the whale's bounty. In an era when most Icelanders survived predominantly by raising sheep, a blue whale -- which can reach more than 30 meters long and weigh as much as 150 tonnes -- was a caloric windfall. One animal could yield 60 tonnes of meat -- the equivalent of 3,000 lambs -- and, according to a 13th-century Norse text, was reportedly \"better for eating and smells better than any of the other fishes.\"\n\nYet, \u00d3lafur wasn't so lucky. The whale's body never turned up on Iceland's shores. Later, though, a group of hungry travelers some 1,500 kilometers away, in Greenland, came across a recently dead, beached blue whale. The party was led by an Icelandic chieftain, and Gu\u00f0mundsson recounts that as he and his men butchered the animal, they found embedded within it an iron spearhead marked with \u00d3lafur's emblem. Knowing they couldn't deliver \u00d3lafur his bounty, the men ate the whale, staving off starvation.\n\nThis story -- one of many similar tales that environmental historian Vicki Szabo has been scouring over the last three decades -- offers a compelling glimpse into Icelanders' interactions with blue whales. Norse texts can be scientifically accurate, describing behaviors such as trap feeding, in which the whales open their mouths and let fish gather inside before closing their jaws. But they often combine evidence-based facts with \"supernatural stuff, trolls, and monsters,\" says Szabo. Relying on these documents to paint an accurate picture of human-whale relationships in the Middle Ages, then, is challenging.\n\nBefore the 2000s, the archaeological record wasn't much help either. Since Icelanders usually processed whales on the shoreline, most whalebones were lost to the ocean, so their use is likely underrepresented in the archaeological record. Zooarchaeologists didn't identify whalebones by species; they only categorized them as \"large whale\" or \"small whale.\" Whales' slippery preservation led 20th-century experts to call them the \"invisible resource.\"\n\nAnd though whales were an important source of cultural traditions, building materials, and protein in many northern cultures, most communities focused their hunting on smaller, more manageable species. Were medieval Icelanders really hunting blue whales centuries before the invention of exploding harpoons and faster steam-powered ships? If so, how were they doing it, and how often? And what can these interactions reveal about both historical and modern whale populations?\n\nSzabo, of Western Carolina University in the United States, is now leading a multidisciplinary team of archaeologists, historians, folklorists, and geneticists to try to answer these very questions.\n\nSzabo first became interested in Icelanders' history with whales in the early 1990s. At first, she was limited to studying printed works like the Icelandic sagas, a collection of legendary tales recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. The sagas and other texts -- including those written by J\u00f3n Gu\u00f0mundsson -- are a trove of whale stories. \"These people talked about whales all the time,\" Szabo says. Often, they specifically mentioned blue whales.\n\nThrough her early research, Szabo learned that by the 13th century, Icelanders were so dependent on whales that they wrote complicated laws to establish how washed-up whales were divvied up. A whale's size, how it died, and who owned the property where it beached all determined who got a share of the whale meat. Portioning also depended on who secured it to the shore; if an Icelander saw a dead whale floating in the sea, they were legally obligated to find a way to tether it to land. And hunters not only marked their spears with their signature emblem, they also registered those emblems with the government, improving the chances that they could claim their lawful share of any whale they speared. In addition to consuming whale meat and blubber, Norse people used the bones as tools, vessels, gaming pieces, furniture, and beams for roofs and walls.\n\nEven with government regulations, though, whale hunting was a fraught enterprise. Spearheads were expensive, crafted by Icelandic smiths using iron smelted from deposits in bogs. One fisherman in the literature grew so frustrated at losing five spears in a single day that he gave up hunting altogether. And scavenging whales that beached themselves or turned up dead on shore still caused drama. At least five sagas tell stories of fights breaking out over the rights to stranded blue whales.\n\nSzabo was fascinated by such stories, and curious about which whale species Icelanders relied on most. Yet it wasn't until the mid-2000s, when scientists pioneered new techniques to analyze ancient bones using DNA analysis and spectroscopy, that Szabo could begin to answer her question. Spectroscopy, which reveals the chemical makeup of bones by analyzing collagen proteins found in bone fragments, is cheaper and faster than DNA analysis. It's proven effective at identifying many whale species, including blues, but it can't distinguish between certain species, such as right and bowhead whales. Scientists often use spectroscopy as an initial screen of species, then clear up any uncertainties with DNA testing.\n\nCamilla Speller, an archaeologist at Canada's University of British Columbia who is not involved in the Iceland project, says these technologies have helped change our knowledge of past human-whale relations, as well as our understanding of the diversity of whales that historical humans hunted. \"Every time we do spectroscopy on an assemblage, I think, Oh man, I wasn't expecting that species to appear.\" When Szabo and collaborators applied DNA and spectroscopy techniques to whalebones in Iceland, the outcome was no different.\n\nBeginning in 2017, geneticist Brenna Frasier, a collaborator of Szabo's, analyzed the DNA of 124 whalebones from a dozen archaeological sites across Iceland dating from around 900 CE to 1800 CE in her lab at Saint Mary's University in Nova Scotia. Over half of the bones came from blue whales. The rest were a mix of over a dozen other species. As the climate shifted from the medieval warm period, which ended in the 13th century, to the colder temperatures of the little ice age, evidence of many smaller whale species disappeared from the archaeological record. Blue whales, however, still dominated.\n\nWhen Szabo saw the results, she was \"staggered.\" No other culture is known to have relied on blue whales so regularly. This is partially because blue whales typically live in the open ocean rather than close to shore, dive to depths of 315 meters, and tend to sink when they die. Then there's the technical challenge of the whales' imposing size. Frasier was involved in the necropsy of a blue whale that washed up near Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2021. She says it took researchers several days with heavy machinery to break down the animal. \"I had never been waist-deep in whale until that event,\" she says.\n\nBecause of the challenges of hunting and harvesting blue whales, Szabo's team of researchers had expected to find more evidence of smaller whales like pilot whales and minke whales, which would have been easier to drive ashore and butcher and, today at least, are more abundant. In similar archaeological and historical studies in the Faroe Islands, the relatively svelte pilot whale dominated. Medieval Dutch hunters favored right whales, which come close to shore and float when they die. Other traditional whaling cultures also tend to prefer slower or more coastal species that are more accessible and easier to hunt. \"I find it surprising that a medieval whaler would go after a blue whale,\" says Speller.\n\nBut as Szabo's team continues to show, medieval Icelanders seem to have done just that.\n\nThat the DNA analysis now substantiates the attention blue whales received in Icelandic texts is gratifying for Szabo. It means that Icelanders were scavenging and likely even hunting whales as far back as the ninth century -- roughly the time that they first arrived on Iceland's shores. Authors like Gu\u00f0mundsson weren't exaggerating: Icelanders were likely encountering blues and exploiting them more than any other species of whale.\n\nRecently, the landscape has offered further validation that preindustrial Icelanders regularly killed and harvested these leviathans. While in Iceland in 2023, Szabo and Frasier were encouraged by a colleague to meet the Icelandic archaeologist L\u00edsabet Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir from the Institute of Archaeology, Iceland. In a conference room at the University of Iceland, Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir -- who often studies driftwood in the archaeological record -- told Frasier and Szabo of a new archaeological site, known as Hafnir, that she had been digging on the Skagi Peninsula in northwestern Iceland. As waves erode the coastline, Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir said, ancient whalebones dislodge from the sediment like loose teeth, offering a new trove of research materials; Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir had found whalebones left by residents at least as far back as the 12th century.\n\nHearing this, Frasier and Szabo shared an excited glance. While most bones were still on site, Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir showed them a few she had collected. \"We were just astounded by this box filled with some of the largest bones we'd ever seen from an archaeological context,\" Szabo says.\n\nLater, Szabo visited Hafnir herself. Hafnir's fertile bays and long green grass give the appearance of a place that would be ideal for settlement if the weather wasn't so often terrible. Local farmers recently told Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir that last spring's winds were so strong they picked up lambs and blew them downwind. Later that summer, Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir lost a tent on the dig site in the same way. \"The wind and the rain can drive you insane,\" she admits.\n\nFor the researchers, the struggles are worth it. \"I've never seen an archaeological site with this much whalebone falling out,\" Szabo says. There are too many whalebones for it to be random beached whales, Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir adds: \"[People] must have been hunting them.\" So far, the team has uncovered dozens, possibly hundreds, of whalebones that were worked or whittled by local people across many phases of settlement. They've also found unprecedented intact bones, like a vertebra the diameter of a steering wheel, that are so big Szabo thinks they must have come from blue whales. The researchers are now in the process of running their initial spectroscopy tests to confirm that blue whales are as common here as they've proven to be at other Icelandic sites.\n\nBut they need to act fast: every time the archaeological team returns, more history has been lost to the sea. \"It is the last chance to get the information out before it just completely goes,\" Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir says.\n\nFor Szabo's project, which is set to wrap up in the fall of 2024, one question remains: how exactly were Icelanders able to harvest so many blue whales? \u00c6var Petersen, an independent Icelandic biologist and consultant for Szabo's project, suspects people may have hunted the smaller calves of the species, which can be more curious toward humans and more manageable once dead. He also thinks that early settlers wouldn't have cared what species of whale they'd found; they'd use whatever was readily available. Perhaps what was most available was blue whales.\n\nThis theory is backed up by new evidence that blue whales may have been more abundant and lived closer to shore between 900 and 1900 CE than today. As Petersen recently documented, for example, 32 blue whales were trapped in an ice-filled cove in \u00c1nasta\u00f0ir in northwestern Iceland during a raging May snowstorm in 1882 -- an exceptionally cold year in Iceland when famine loomed. There were no roads, yet people flocked to the cove, traveling over the icy landscape on foot or horseback -- some from as far as 100 kilometers away -- to help kill and butcher the whales. Whale meat from \u00c1nasta\u00f0ir possibly saved several thousand people from starvation. Some meat and blubber were eaten fresh; some were stored in special pits called hvalgrafir for as long as four years.\n\nToday, finding so many blue whales so close to shore is unheard of.\n\nA year after the 1882 slaughter at \u00c1nasta\u00f0ir, improved technology allowed Norwegians to begin hunting blue whales at an industrial scale around Iceland. Other nations soon followed, and by the mid-20th century, industrial whalers from the United States, Japan, Russia, and elsewhere had likely massacred 90 percent of the planet's blue whale population. Even though Iceland no longer allows blue whale hunting, commercial whaling is still legal there today. Iceland is the only country that allows whaling of the endangered fin whale, the second-largest whale species.\n\nAround the same time as the 1882 slaughter, a slight global cooling trend brought more ice into Iceland's coves. The combination of human pressures and an icier coast may have eventually driven blue whales offshore. Perhaps, Szabo theorizes, Icelanders were able to harvest so many blue whales because they behaved differently than today's blue whales: industrial whaling hadn't yet decimated their population, and different climatic conditions tempted them closer to shores and coves. Northwestern Iceland in particular -- where Hafnir, \u00c1nasta\u00f0ir, and several other archaeological sites are located -- increasingly stands out as a historical hotspot of blue whale activity.\n\nNorthwestern Iceland is also where \u00d3lafur, the 14th-century hunter, speared blue whales from his open wooden boat. Later in his life, \u00d3lafur saw a female whale coming into the bay near his home. According to Gu\u00f0mundsson's telling, \u00d3lafur took aim but only punctured the animal's dorsal fin. The scarred blue whale returned to the same bay for 15 years afterward. \u00d3lafur appears to have developed a personal kinship with the whale, choosing not to try to kill her again. But he had no problem shooting the whale's calf. One summer, when he raised his spear and took aim at the calf, his spear went askew, hitting the mother instead.\n\nWith that, he'd had enough. That was the last time \u00d3lafur speared a whale.", "source": {"uri": "hakaimagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hakai Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hakai_magazine@hakaimagazine.com",

likely killed by massive cruise ship,...", "body": "A massive cruise ship likely struck and killed an endangered whale before sailing into the East River Saturday morning -- and there's no telling how long the dead mammal was dragged by the boat before it was discovered, according to marine experts.\n\nThe 44-foot adult female Sei whale was found as the MSC Meraviglia docked at the Port of Brooklyn, a spokesperson for MSC cruises confirmed.\n\nThe unlucky cetacean was removed from the 19-deck ship and towed to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, Tuesday for a necropsy, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries spokesperson Andrea Gomez -- but emphasized it is too soon to tell whether or not the whale was dead before impact.\n\nRob DiGiovanni, the founder and chief scientist of the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society, however, told The Post it was more than likely that the \"interaction with the vessel contributed to her death.\"\n\n\"It looks like she was eating,\" DiGiovanni said, indicating she was a healthy whale with relatively fresh food in her stomach.\n\nThe hulking Meraviglia -- the same ship that rescued 24 distressed Cuban migrants from a boat off the coast of Florida last year -- weighs 171,600 gigatons and stands 214 feet tall.\n\nWhen and where the whale was struck remains a mystery, but Sei whales are typically observed in deeper waters far from the coastline, according to NOAA.\n\nThey are one of the largest whale species and are internationally protected, with vessel strikes listed as one of the biggest threats to its dwindling population.\n\nThe body was \"pretty decomposed,\" DiGiovanni revealed, but said that does not help professionals lock down a timeline of its death.\n\nThe temperature of the water, especially on the higher side, can accelerate the decomposition process by days.\n\nThe tragic event is unfortunately not uncommon, according to DiGiovanni, but it's nearly impossible to track just how often it occurs because the whales could sink to the bottom of the ocean floor after being struck.\n\nShip staff or guests also might not even notice a striking, considering just how large cruise vessels stand, making even the world's largest mammal look like an ant.\n\nSuch strikes could contribute to the unusual mortuary event in the New York Bight Apex -- the waters from Fire Island to the Manasquan Inlet in New Jersey.\n\nStarting in 2016, humpback, Mackey and North Atlantic Right whale deaths skyrocketed from one to three per year to 12 to 14 per year, DiGiovanni said.\n\nThe shocking death surge is a tragic side effect of whales flocking to Big Apple waters in higher numbers per year, creating a Catch-22 situation.\n\nWhile some stay year-round, the amount of whales enjoying the

for this sei whale is still on-going, the risks to large whales from ship-strikes remain a great concern in our region,\" Rosenbaum said.\n\nIn an email, Gomez said NOAA encourages mariners traveling

Frosty the killer whale made a rare appearance off the coast of California.\n\nA whale-watching boat took video of the first sighting of the unusual whale last week. The educator for the company said that seeing orca whales off of California is rare enough. But, watchers were treated to a very rare milky-white killer whale too.\n\n\"Sightings of killer whales are few and far between along the Southern California coastline, so it was a very special encounter,\" Jessica Roam of Newport Landing Whale Watching said in a statement.\n\nWHY ARE KILLER WHALES ATTACKING SHIPS?\n\nFrosty, aka CA216C1 to the California Killer Whale Project, is one of only five or six known killer whales in the world with Leucism, according to the Oceanic Society. Leucism is a condition that causes the partial loss of pigmentation, leading to pale, white or patchy coloration.\n\n\"Leucistic Frosty likely has Chediak-Higashi syndrome (rare autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disorder often including respiratory infections and reduced pigmentation),\" the California Killer Whale Project posted on social media. \"Frosty looked more robust than in past encounters: so wonderful to see Frosty thriving!\"\n\nThe leucitic whale is a Biggs or transient killer whale. They live in small pods in coastal waters where they hunt prey like sea lions, porpoises and dolphins.\n\nSPECTACULAR UNDERWATER FOOTAGE CAPTURES ORCA 'ORCHESTRA' IN ICY ANTARCTICA WATERS\n\n\"We got extremely lucky, and were able to relocate a pod of at least 5-7 orcas, one of which was a 4-year-old calf named 'Frosty' after it's milky white appearance,\" Capt. Dani Fasser told Roam. \"We were watching a pair of giant fin whales, and all of a sudden, we saw puffs in the distance, which were definitely not dolphin. Turns out it was killer whales.\"\n\nFrosty and family were feeding on a beach ball-sized chunk of gray whale blubber, according to the project. Fasser said the whales passed it back and forth and dove under the boat.\n\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n\n\"They were circling and feeding nearly constantly throughout the 4.5 hours of observations, on a gray whale that they had likely killed the previous day; multiple whales have pieces of gray whale blubber/skin in their mouths,\" the project posted.\n\nOrcas can be spotted off the coast from January to May and September to November, according to the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. Most sightings are in April, May and June, while the mammals feed on northbound migrating gray whales.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hillary_andrews@foxweather.com", "name": "Hillary Andrews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leucism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_watching", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whale watching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beluga whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport Beach, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pigment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominance (genetics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porpoise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunodeficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oceania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gray whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fin whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/delaney-trowbridge-4-scaled.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545146", "eventUri": "eng-9545146", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It takes a long time to gather photos and observations to recognize that there's something different about these killer whales,\" said co-author Dr. Andrew Trites, IOF professor.\n\nThe 49 killer whales could not be matched with any known animals through photos or descriptions. \"In one of the first encounters researchers had with a pod of these oceanic killer whales, they were observed taking on a herd of nine adult female sperm whales, eventually making off with one. It is the first time killer whales have been reported to attack sperm whales on the west coast,\" said McInnes. \"Other encounters include an attack on a pygmy sperm whale, predation on a northern elephant seal and Risso's dolphin, and what appeared to be a post-meal lull after scavenging a leatherback turtle.\"\n\nA key clue to the new population's presumed habitat range lies in cookiecutter shark bite scars observed on almost all of the orcas. This parasitic shark lives in the open ocean, meaning the new population primarily inhabit deep waters far from land.\n\nThe orcas also feature physical differences from the three main ecotypes, including in their dorsal fins and saddle patches -- the grey or white patches by the fin. \"While the sizes and shapes of the dorsal fins and saddle patches are similar to transient and offshore ecotypes, the shape of their fins varied, from pointed like transients to rounded like offshore killer whales,\" said McInnes. \"Their saddle patch patterns also differed, with some having large uniformly gray saddle patches and others having smooth narrow saddle patches similar to those seen in killer whales in tropical regions.\"\n\nAlong with marine mammal stock assessment surveys, fishermen and passengers on an open-ocean birding expedition and whale-watching tour also provided observations of the unidentified killer whales, said Dr. Trites. Spotting the new population has become something of a hobby among fishermen, some of whom have bought cameras for their trips specifically to snap an encounter, the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers hope to document more sightings and gather more information, including acoustic data about the orcas' calls and genetic information from DNA samples to further investigate how these killer whales may differ, or not, from already documented populations.", "source": {"uri": "news.ubc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "UBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pelagic zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sea turtle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sperm whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorsal fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookiecutter_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cookiecutter shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_sperm_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pygmy sperm whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_elephant_seal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern elephant seal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risso's_dolphin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risso's dolphin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birdwatching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_watching", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whale watching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scavenger"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Ecology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Ecology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://news.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/killer-whale-ocx043-1024x654.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545146", "eventUri": "eng-9545146", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries confirmed the species of the whale, highlighting its status as endangered. The incident occurred on Saturday, drawing immediate attention from both marine authorities and wildlife conservationists.\n\nThe MSC Meraviglia, operated by Geneva-based MSC Cruises, was identified as the vessel involved. Upon docking in Brooklyn, before its scheduled journey to New England and Canada, the cruise line promptly reported the unfortunate discovery to the relevant authorities. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of any marine life,\" MSC Cruises officials stated, emphasizing their commitment to adhering to regulations aimed at protecting whale populations. These measures include modifying ship itineraries in certain areas to minimize risks to these majestic creatures.\n\nFollowing the incident, the whale was transported to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. This relocation facilitated better access to necessary equipment for a thorough examination of the carcass. Andrea Gomez, a spokesperson for NOAA fisheries, announced that a necropsy was conducted on Tuesday to ascertain critical details about the whale's death. This examination is crucial for determining whether the sei whale was alive before the collision with the MSC Meraviglia.\n\nSei whales are known for inhabiting deeper waters, often far from coastlines, making such incidents particularly unusual and concerning for conservation efforts. These whales rank among the largest species and enjoy international protection due to their endangered status.\n\nThe investigation into this incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by marine life due to human activities at sea.

However, this event serves as a somber reminder of the delicate balance between maritime travel and marine ecosystem preservation.\n\nAs authorities continue to analyze samples collected during the necropsy, the maritime community awaits further insights that could inform future strategies for protecting vulnerable whale populations.

The decomposition process of a whale carcass can be accelerated by several days when the water temperature is higher than usual.\n\nAccording to DiGiovanni, the occurrence of whales being struck by ships is not uncommon, but it is difficult to determine the frequency of such incidents because the whales may sink to the ocean floor after being hit. The size of cruise vessels can make it challenging for staff or guests to notice when a whale has been struck, making even the world's largest mammal look like an ant.\n\nThese ship strikes may be contributing to the unusual mortality event in the New York Bight Apex, which encompasses the waters from Fire Island to the Manasquan Inlet in New Jersey.\n\nSince 2016, the number of humpback, Mackey, and North Atlantic Right whale deaths has increased from one to three per year to 12 to 14 per year, DiGiovanni added.\n\nThe surge in whale deaths is an unfortunate consequence of the increasing number of whales visiting the waters near New York City each year. While some whales remain in the area year-round, the population in the East River increases during the spring months.\n\nDiGiovanni urges boaters to exercise caution in the waters, stating, \"We start to see increases in whale sightings now, so we urge boaters to use caution in the waters.\" He encourages ship captains to to consider the \"Slow: Children at Play\" mentality when navigating the open seas.\n\nNOAA said, \"Mariners operating along the US East Coast are encouraged to slow their vessel speed, stay alert, and report any sightings of right whales or any dead, injured, or entangled whales.\"\n\nSei whales are among the largest whale species and are protected internationally, with vessel strikes being one of the most significant threats to their declining population.\n\nThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

About 20 humpback whales were involved in this intensive heat run. The sound of the exhausted whales breathing out and their fast swim speeds felt like trains rushing by our boat,\" Dr Meynecke said.\n\n\"These whales were tagged with suction cup tags to study their complex underwater behaviour. Much to our surprise, we also saw short, deep dives, down to almost 200m depth, followed by fast swim speeds and underwater battles among these individuals.\"\n\nDuring the whale migration in Australia, humpback whales generally don't have the option to make deep dives as the continental shelf extends widely from the coast.\n\nStudying heat runs and competitive groups allows Dr Meynecke to continue to learn more about the complex dynamics in these groups. There are various positions male humpbacks whales in a group adopt such as primary escort, challengers and observers. Males work together against each other and vary their techniques to deter competitors.\n\nBut not all encounters were as joyful and dynamic. During the 10-day expedition, Dr Meynecke and the team encountered a young and sick humpback and another entangled in fishing gear, underlining the \"clear signs of increasing impacts on this species\".\n\n\"The scarring on whales like this from previous entanglements tells a story about the scale of the issue globally, with many whales having to battle for their survival when trapped in nets and lines.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of human-driven impacts on global whale populations. One recent study from the Northern Hemisphere confirmed the deadly toll climate change can take; food shortages have led to a decline in Hawaiian humpback whale populations - how much pressure can these populations withstand before we start seeing declines and related cascade impacts on ecosystems?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the first humpback whales on the 2024 migration season have been sighted on the east coast of Australia - but, with the recent experience fresh in his mind, what does Dr Meynecke expect to see in the coming months?\n\n\"We will see an earlier than average start of the main migration from mid-May onwards and also see again a number of entangled whales in fishing gear move up the coast. Sadly, they are just the tip of the iceberg with many of them remaining unseen and unable to track.\"\n\nFor Dr Meynecke, there is much still to study and document regarding humpback whale behaviour and the issues impacting him. Research that will also benefit other whale species by developing new methods.\n\nHowever, what holds Dr Meynecke and the Whales and Climate Research Program team back from performing consistent and comprehensive studies around the world is significant investment into this important research area.\n\n\"For our Whales and Climate Research Program, my aim is to advance our current outcomes to a global initiative that safeguards whales into the future encompassing the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\"We are now a UN Ocean Decade endorsed research group, with our Phase 2 research program seeing an expansion to South America until our funding ceases.\n\n\"The generous philanthropic funding WCP has received to date has fuelled and empowered our research teams in South Africa and South America to undertake vital studies on humpback whales and climate impacts.\n\n\"But for this work and our findings to truly make an impact on whale populations globally, we need to expand to the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\"My vision and dream is to bring this very successful work we have been doing for whales to the global level, creating a whale data portal/tool that is accessible to the public, but most importantly policy makers.", "source": {"uri": "indiaeducationdiary.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary"}, "authors":

Its body was discovered as the ship neared the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and authorities were \"immediately notified,\" said MSC Cruises, which owns the ship.\n\nA spokesperson for the company said in an email that it had \"comprehensive measures\" in place to avoid such collisions, including training deck officers and altering itineraries in certain areas to avoid them. \"We will continue to evaluate and update our procedures with our partners and the authorities,\" she said.\n\nMarine authorities said that they had towed the animal, estimated to weigh some 50,000 pounds, from the bow, and transferred it by boat to a beach in Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where they conducted a necropsy Tuesday.\n\nThe investigation is continuing, but preliminary results -- broken bones in the whale's right flipper; tissue trauma along its right shoulder blade; a full stomach; and decent layer of blubber -- all pointed toward the animal having been in otherwise good health when it was likely struck and killed by the ship, said Robert A. DiGiovanni, the chief scientist of the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society, which is leading the investigation.\n\nThe whale was already \"pretty decomposed\" by the time scientists began the necropsy, he added, so they worked quickly to collect samples that could be tested for contaminants and other biotoxins that would indicate any other relevant health issues. \"It looks like the animal was alive and it was hit by a vessel,\" he said, noting that investigators had not ruled out other factors.\n\nDiGiovanni said that his conservation group, which is federally authorized to respond to marine mammal strandings in New York, had dealt with around 100 whales over the past several years, many of which had been entangled in nets or struck by vessels. Most of those whales were humpback and North Atlantic right whales, he added, noting that it was more uncommon to come across a sei whale.\n\nSei whales usually live in subtropical, temperate and subpolar waters and are named after the Norwegian word for pollock, \"seje,\" because the mammals are often found together with the fish. Their long, sleek bodies are usually dark blue or black with a cream-colored underside, and are often scarred by shark and lamprey bites.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the whales were commercially hunted for their meat and oil, decimating their population, which is now designated as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nDiGiovanni said that the death was a reminder that humans shared the open water with many other mammals. \"When you're out there, these animals might be there,\" he said. \"We need to make people more aware about how to operate around these animals.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said by email that mariners along the East Coast were encouraged to slow down their vessels, stay alert, and report any sightings of dead, injured or entangled whales to authorities.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sei whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Cruise_Terminal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Cruise Terminal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Cruises", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSC Cruises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scapula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandy Hook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flipper (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Mammal_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Mammal Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_right_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Atlantic right whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamprey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Nautical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Nautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545146", "eventUri": "eng-9545146", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Whether catching some rays at one of the many beautiful beaches on Cape Cod or attending a Red Sox game at Fenway Park in Boston, there is plenty of summer fun for everyone in Massachusetts.\n\nIf your family will be visiting Massachusetts this summer one activity that is fun for all ages is whale watching. Witnessing a humpback, minke, finback, etc. in the beautiful waters of Massachusetts is a breathtaking and exciting experience but where should you go to see these stunning creatures in action?\n\nTripadvisor published an article that lists the best whale-watching trips in the country and Massachusetts appeared on the list three times. Let's find out where these prime trips are in the Bay State.\n\nOne of Massachusetts's best whale watch trips, 7 Seas Whale Watch in Gloucester made the list. Here's Tripadvisor's review of 7 Seas Whale Watch:\n\nWith easy access to the protected Stellwagen Bank Marine Sanctuary, Gloucester is a great destination for East Coast whale watching. Whale watching cruises from Cape Ann frequently spot humpback whales during the whale watching season of May through November, when the whales breach, blow, and sometimes play in the wake of the boats.\n\nLocated in Barnstable, Hyannis Whale Watch Cruises made the list and this is a great choice especially if you want to see many types of whales. Here's Tripadvisor's review of Hyannis Whale Watch Cruises:\n\nJust a short trip from Boston, Barnstable is a top destination for whale watching on Cape Cod, where you'll spot humpback whales, minke whales, and finback whales. Keep a sharp eye from the beach and you may catch a glimpse of a passing pod.\n\nThe last whale watch trip that made Tripadvisor's list is Provincetown Whale Watch. Another great option if you want to witness many types of whales in nature. Here's Tripadvisor's review of Provincetown Whale Watch:\n\nJust off the end of Cape Cod, the Stellwagen Bank Marine Sanctuary protects 842 square miles of whale heaven, where shallow waters are rich with nutrients and food. Whale watching tours from Provincetown often see humpback whales, minke whales, finbacks, pilot whales, and even right whales, a critically-endangered species that's made a Cape Cod comeback in recent whale watching seasons.\n\nIf you are looking for an unforgettable family experience this summer, visit Massachusetts and book one of these whale-watch trips. You'll have plenty of photo opportunities and cherished memories for years to come.

The suit claims, among many other things, that Biological Opinion (BiOp) issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to gain approval of the project failed to account for the cumulative effects on the critical endangered North Atlantic Right Whale (NARW) population, when there are 32 offshore wind projects planned to be placed in the whales' migratory, feeding, and calving route. Instead, it considered CVOW separate from all the others, counter to federal requirements.\n\nThis brief will discuss some of the other claims in the lawsuit from the Heartland Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the National Legal and Policy Center.\n\nAnticipating Project-Related Losses of Whales Well Past What Their Population Could Sustain\n\nIn 2022 the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries determined the Potential Biological Removal Rate of NARWs to be \"0.7 whales.\" At 0.7, it means \"the population cannot sustain, on average over the course of a year, the death or serious injury of a single individual due to human causes.\" Not even one whale.\n\nIn 2023 NOAA Fisheries anticipated that CVOW will result in the deaths or serious injuries of eight NARWs per year (see Table 7), as well as two fin whales (endangered), 11 minke whales (protected), and 12 humpback whales (depleted), among many other impacted species.\n\nIn the BiOp, however, the NMFS managed to produce an Incidental Take Statement (ITS) that estimated zero whales would be as much as injured by the proposed CVOW activities.\n\nSuch a gaping discrepancy is one of the lawsuit's examples of the \"arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful\" nature of the BiOp and its ITS, which it argued must be set aside along with any federal project approvals relying on it.\n\nOn March 30, a mother right whale was found dead off the coast of Virginia Beach. It was the fourth dead whale in and around Virginia Beach in the month of March. Also, her orphaned calf is expected to die.\n\nNot Following the \"Best Scientific Information Available\" to Keep from Jeopardizing Right Whales' Survival as a Species\n\nAnother claim in the lawsuit is that the BiOp did not meet its requirement under the Endangered Species Act to use the \"best scientific and commercial data available\" to make sure the project would not \"jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species\" or harm or destroy an endangered species' habitat. The required 60-Day Notice of Intent to Sue letter sent to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), NMFS, et al. by CFACT and Heartland provided details.\n\nAccording to the letter from David P. Hubbard of Gatzke Dillon & Balance, LLP, \"BOEM has admitted that when the noise regulations for the NARW were promulgated, the noise parameters for baleen whales were 'virtually unknown' and 'almost non-existent.'\" Calling it their \"#1 information need,\" BOEM commissioned several studies -- but not one study has been concluded.\n\nThe many studies of baleen whale hearing capabilities that were recommended in the \"BOEM and NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale and Offshore Wind Strategy\" document are still all \"ongoing.\" A series of studies co-funded with the U.S. Navy, \"Auditory Weighting Function for Low-Frequency Whales,\" is also \"ongoing and not due for completion until 2025.\"\n\nBOEM suggests that the real problem with this lack of knowledge could be \"potential over-estimation of takes and/or effects and improper application of mitigation.\" BOEM makes it seem as if the issue with not knowing anything about what could damage the whales' hearing could mean they might do too much to protect the whales.\n\nOf course, it's equally likely there could be potential underestimation of takes [whales killed, injured, or harassed] and not enough mitigation. Equal likelihood, but unequal end results. The end result of overestimation would be fewer vastly expensive, unreliable, and unsightly offshore wind facilities built, leaving coastal communities and electricity consumers better off. The end result of underestimation, however, would be extinction. Plus electricity consumers and coastal communities would also be worse off.\n\nThe letter explained,\n\nBecause BOEM admitted that it based its regulations on outdated and incomplete data, without satisfying this \"number one information need,\" the BiOp's conclusion that \"[n]o mortality or permanent injury (auditory or other) is expected from exposure to any aspect of the proposed action\" (p. 216) is arbitrary and capricious.\n\nAgain, CVOW is far from the only project the whales will encounter. The letter noted that \"NMFS issued 163 'Level B take' permits for the NARW\" to offshore wind project developers up and down the East Coast, affecting \"more than 50% of the entire estimated NARW population of 350 animals.\" (Level B take permits allow permittees to \"disturb marine mammal stock by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding or sheltering.\") Worse, the 163 take permits fail to \"take into account the Level B harassment authorizations for construction-related noise\" from all the projects in the whales' migratory, feeding, and calving path.\n\nBy obvious implication, the same individual whales would suffer successive impacts from each project as they encounter them in migration.\n\nThe letter noted that, in addition to ignoring the effects of construction-related noise, including \"soft start\" pile driving, on the whales, the BiOp \"fails to acknowledge, much less assess, the impacts of pushing NARW out of the project area into waters with heavy vessel traffic and significant fishing activity ... [and forcing] NARW out of their preferred travel corridors and foraging zones into areas where they could be struck by vessels and/or become entangled in fishing gear -- the two most prominent causes of NARW mortality and population declines.\"\n\nJudge Loren L. AliKhan ... questioned Dominion Energy on approval by the federal government for its five mitigation plans.\n\nThe judge ordered Dominion to file a status report on approval by this Friday, May 3.\n\nShe also ordered Dominion and the Biden Administration to file their response to the coalition's lawsuit by May 6 and for the coalition to file its response by May 9.\n\nThe paper stated that the judge was \"expected to rule on the preliminary injunction shortly thereafter.\"", "source": {"uri": "johnlocke.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "John Locke Foundation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Its body was discovered as the ship neared the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and the authorities were \"immediately notified,\" said MSC Cruises, which owns the ship.\n\nA spokeswoman for the company said in an email that it had \"comprehensive measures\" in place to avoid such collisions, including training deck officers and altering itineraries in certain areas to avoid them. \"We will continue to evaluate and update our procedures with our partners and the authorities,\" she said.\n\nMarine authorities said that they had towed the animal, estimated to weigh some 50,000 pounds, from the bow, and transferred it by boat to a beach in Sandy Hook, N.J., where they conducted a necropsy on Tuesday.\n\nThe investigation is continuing, but preliminary results -- broken bones in the whale's right flipper; tissue trauma along its right shoulder blade; a full stomach and decent layer of blubber -- all pointed toward the animal having been in otherwise good health when it was likely struck and killed by the ship, said Robert A. DiGiovanni, the chief scientist of the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society, which is leading the investigation.\n\nThe whale was already \"pretty decomposed\" by the time scientists began the necropsy, he added, so they worked quickly to collect samples that could be tested for contaminants and other biotoxins that would indicate any other relevant health issues. \"It looks like the animal was alive and it was hit by a vessel,\" he said, noting that investigators had not ruled out other factors.\n\nMr. Giovanni said that his conservation group, which is federally authorized to respond to marine mammal strandings in New York, had dealt with around 100 whales over the past several years, many of which had been entangled in nets or struck by vessels.

I'm gonna just watch the sun sparkle on the water and that's gonna like light me up from just a day of emails,\" Bloom said. \"I mean it just seemed so ... just so benign.\"\n\nAt Bloom's home on Lena Loop Road, the ocean is practically part of the backyard. She goes paddle boarding often, but this particular afternoon was far from routine.\n\nA few minutes into her paddle, she spotted a pod of orcas -- four or five of them -- out on the horizon. She took a video to send to her parents. But then she spotted something in the water.\n\n\"I looked down, and I saw this white color coming up from under. And I was like, 'Huh, a dead halibut is floating belly up under my paddleboard,'\" Bloom said. \"And then her fin sliced up out of the water, and she exhaled.\"\n\nBefore she knew what was happening, a large female killer whale lifted Bloom's paddleboard up out of the water.\n\n\"And at that moment it was like terror,\" Bloom said.\n\nIn Juneau, people share the land with bears, eagles, whales and more. It's one of the reasons people love living here, but earlier this month, a handful of close encounters with a curious killer whale reminded people of the city's wildness.\n\nAs her board was bobbing, Bloom stood frozen with fear as the whale circled her a half dozen times, diving down under her and then twisting around to look up at the surface. Bloom says she made eye contact with the young orca.\n\n\"And then I started talking to her, I was like 'I have kids. Please go away.'\"\n\nEventually, the whale did go away and Bloom was able to make it to shore safely, though she was shaken up.\n\nLater that afternoon, the whale sidled up to Matt Musslewhite's red skiff. He was sailing near Point Louisa, just a few hundred yards down the shoreline. When he saw the whale's black fins glistening on the surface of the water, he cut the engine to let it safely pass.\n\n\"Instead she just turned and charged right up to me and ran her dorsal fin down the side of the boat, and circled round the boat a couple of times,\" Musslewhite said. \"Then (she) took off to join the rest of her pack.\"\n\nMusslewhite said the whale was gentle.\n\n\"I think she might have been a teenager, a curious teenager just coming to check out my boat,\" he said.\n\nMarine Mammal Specialist Suzie Teerlink with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said there were at least three reports of close encounters with this orca, who was in fact a teenager, on April 26. But no one has been able to identify the specific whale or the pod it belongs to.\n\nIn a social media video taken by another paddler, the whale splashes around, making circles before poking her head out and spraying from her blowhole.\n\nTeerlink said that most of the time killer whales will keep their distance when they come across people.\n\n\"At the same time, they're really smart, really curious animals,\" she said. \"They're at home in their environment and if something strikes their curiosity they might push that envelope.\"\n\nThere are no local reports of killer whales pursuing humans to hurt them. But there have been reports of pods attacking boats in other parts of the world.\n\nTeerlink says it's best for both whales and people to keep our distance.\n\n\"We don't want killer whales, you know, individuals to get too comfortable going up to people to get too comfortable going up to people,\" she said.\n\nSo if you encounter a whale yourself, the best thing to do is move away as quickly as possible.\n\nOrcas tend to migrate over large areas relatively fast. So while they're pretty common in Juneau, the curious teenage whale and her pod have probably left the area by now.\n\nBloom said learning more about orca's curious nature has calmed her fears a bit. She feels there's an inherent stigma around the meat-eating marine mammals, which made her more afraid.\n\n\"We call them killer whales,\" Bloom said. \"Why do we have to call them that? Because it makes them scarier than they need to be.\"\n\nAnd in the week since the close encounter, she's come to appreciate it, in a way.\n\n\"This is so Alaska,\" Bloom said. \"All you gotta do is walk out your front door, and it's like epic.\"\n\nBut for now, she plans to paddleboard on Auke Lake instead.", "source": {"uri": "alaskapublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alaska Public Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_canny@alaskapublic.org", "name": "Anna Canny", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddleboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paddleboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneau,_Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juneau, Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Juneau, Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halibut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halibut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorsal fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_diving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underwater diving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowhole_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blowhole (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnivore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.alaskapublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3R3A6716-1-830x553-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545146", "eventUri": "eng-9545146", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2591, "textEnd": 2599}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Lab experiments suggest their voice boxes have a unique feature", "body": "LONDON -- Whales sing loud enough that their songs travel through the ocean, but knowing the mechanics behind that has been a mystery.\n\nScientists now think they have an idea, and it's something not seen in other animals: a specialized voice box.\n\nExperts say the discovery, while based on a study that is too tiny to be definitive, will direct future research into how whales communicate.\n\nIn a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, Coen Elemans of the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues studied the voice boxes, or larynxes, from three dead, stranded whales -- a humpback, minke and sei, which are all types of baleen whales.\n\nIn the laboratory, the scientists blew air through the voice boxes under controlled conditions to see what tissues might vibrate. Researchers also created computer models of the sei whale's vocalizations and matched them to recordings of similar whales taken in the wild.\n\nWhales' ancestors were land-dwellers about 50 million years ago before moving into water. Elemans said the animals adapted their voice boxes over tens of millions of years to make sounds underwater.\n\nUnlike humans and other mammals, baleen whales don't have teeth or vocal chords. Instead, in their voice boxes, they have a U-shaped tissue that allows them to breathe in massive amounts of air and a large \"cushion\" of fat and muscle not seen in other animal species. Whales sing by pushing the tissue against the fat and muscle cushion, Elemans said.\n\n\"This is the most comprehensive and significant study to date on how baleen whales vocalize, a long-standing mystery in the field,\" said Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor of oceans at Stanford University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nHe noted there is more to be studied \"given the extraordinarily diverse acoustic repertoires\" of whales. Humpbacks, for example, are known to compose elaborate songs that travel across oceans and whale pods.\n\nAs loud as whales' songs are, modelling suggests that humpbacks and related species can't produce sounds louder than the shipping industry, Elemans said.\n\n\"They're really affected by (shipping noise) and it significantly reduces their ability to communicate,\" he said. \"There's just no way for them to get louder.\"\n\nBecause some whales sing as a mating call, the shipping industry's interruption of those songs is potentially worrying, said Michael Noad, director of the Centre for Marine Science at the University of Queensland in Australia. He was not part of the Nature study.\n\n\"For whale populations that are really dispersed, like the Antarctic blue whales, they might not be able to find mates in a noisy ocean environment,\" he said, noting that whale species like humpbacks that gather in big numbers are more likely to shrug off such noise pollution.\n\nThe whale voice boxes tested were from juveniles, not adult males, who do the singing. Because of that, whale expert Joy Reidenberg said, further experiments on adult males are needed to confirm the study's findings.\n\nBut Reidenberg, who works for the Center for Anatomy and Functional Morphology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, noted that lab research is probably as close as we can get to replicating how whales sing.\n\n\"Right now, our technology involves sticking a scope into a whale to see what exactly is vibrating,\" she said. \"Since you're never going to be able to do that in a wild animal, these experiments are the next best thing.\"",

Are the animals producing complex messages akin to human language? Or sharing simpler pieces of information, like dancing bees do? Or are they communicating something else we don't yet understand?\n\nIn 2020, a team of marine biologists and computer scientists joined forces to analyze the click-clacking songs of sperm whales, the gray, block-shaped leviathans that swim in most of the world's oceans. On Tuesday, the scientists reported that the whales use a much richer set of sounds than previously known, which they called a \"sperm whale phonetic alphabet.\"\n\nPeople have a pho-ne-tic alphabet too, which we use to produce a practically infinite supply of words. But Shane Gero, a marine biologist at Carleton University in Ottawa and an author of the study, said it's unclear whether sperm whales similarly turn their phonetic sounds into a language.\n\n\"The fundamental similarities that we do find are really fascinating,\" Dr. Gero said. \"It's totally changed the way we have to do work going forward.\" Since 2005, Dr. Gero and his colleagues have followed a clan of 400 sperm whales around Dominica, an island nation in the eastern Caribbean, eavesdropping on the whales with underwater microphones and tagging some of the animals with sensors.\n\nSperm whales don't produce the eerie melodies sung by humpback whales, which became a sensation in the 1960s. Instead, they rattle off clicks that sound like a cross between Morse code and a creaking door. Sperm whales typically produce pulses of between three and 40 clicks, known as codas. They usually sing these codas while swimming together, raising the possibility that they're communicating with one another.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Gero and his colleagues have reviewed thousands of hours of recordings of the undersea noise. It turns out that sperm whale codas fall into distinct types.\n\nOne type, for example, called \"1+1+3,\" consists of two clicks separated by a pause, followed by three clicks in quick succession.\n\nWith backing from philanthropists, Dr. Gero and his colleagues started \"Project CETI,\" (for \"Cetacean Translation Initiative\"), to investigate whether artificial intelligence and other computing advances could decode whale songs. (The name is a play on SETI, the famous effort to search for extraterrestrial life; whales are also known as cetaceans.)\n\nAs part of the project, Pratyusha Sharma, a computer science graduate student at M.I.T., gave the data from Dominica a fresh look. But she was frustrated by the way biologists had visualized it.\n\nOn a computer screen, the codas appeared as a series of dots along a horizontal line, each dot representing a click. Sharma found it hard to compare codas, especially when two or more whales were singing over each other. So she instead plotted each coda's clicks as dots on a vertical line, and then placed codas along a horizontal line based on when each began.\n\nUsing the new layout, Sharma saw something new. When a sperm whale repeated a coda, it sometimes stretched out the time between the clicks and then gradually tightened it up. Sharma and her colleagues called this phenomenon \"rubato,\" a musical term for speeding up a tempo and then slowing it down.\n\nDr. Gero was startled that Sharma could see something in sperm whale songs that he and his colleagues had missed for years. \"It was a way we hadn't looked at it,\" he said.\n\nCodas are so quick that the human ear can miss a rubato. But the researchers found the pattern in thousands of recorded codas.\n\nThe researchers believe that rubato plays an important role in whale communication. They found that after one whale used rubato, neighboring whales would rapidly match the tempo change with their own codas.\n\nSharma's new visualizations also revealed that sperm whales could occasionally add an extra click to the end of the coda, a behavior they call ornamentation. The scientists found evidence that the extra clicks were not just pointless flourishes. The whales that led groups often used ornamentation, after which their followers often responded with codas of their own.\n\nThe analysis showed that the conventional catalog of sperm whale codas could not capture their full complexity. Sperm whales can produce a 1+1+3 coda, for example, that lasts four-fifths of a second, or one second, or 1.25 seconds. Other codas may last only one-third of a second or half a second.\n\nAll told, the researchers identified 156 different codas, each with distinct combinations of tempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation. Dr. Gero said that this variation is strikingly similar to the way humans combine movements in our lips and tongue to produce a set of phonetic sounds.\n\nA single sound like \"ba,\" or \"na\" carries no semantic meaning on its own. But we can combine them into meaningful words like \"banana.\" The researchers raised the possibility that sperm whales might combine features of codas to convey meaning in a similar way. Other experts said the whale alphabet marked an exciting advance. But they said sperm whale codas might be more akin to music than language.\n\n\"Music can have a strong influence on emotions without it actually conveying information,\" said Taylor Hersh, a bioacoustician at Oregon State University. Rubato might be one way for sperm whales to tighten their social bonds, she speculated, by matching their songs.\n\nJacob Andreas, a computer scientist at M.I.T. and an author of the study, said that the alphabet is allowing the researchers to dig deeper into whale songs. \"Now we have gotten the machinery in place to start tackling the much more ambitious, long-term goal for Project CETI, which is trying to figure out what all of this actually means.\"\n\nMicrophones deployed in the Caribbean are capturing ocean sounds 24 hours a day, and scientists are programming computers to learn how to pick sperm whale songs out from the background noise. Dr. Andreas and his colleagues are also training artificial intelligence programs similar to ChatGPT. After listening to the sperm whale songs, these models might learn to recognize not just rubato and ornamentation, but other features that scientists have missed.\n\nThe hope is that computers will then be able to compose whale songs of their own, which could then be played to the whales.\n\nThat effort leaves other experts skeptical. Luke Rendell, a marine biologist at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland, worries that the A.I. models assume whale songs are a kind of language, rather than something more like music.\n\n\"I've no doubt that you could produce a language model that could learn to produce sperm-whale-like sequences,\" Dr. Rendell said. \"But that's all you get.\"", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType":

This suggests that their communication includes nuanced variations that are recognized and responded to by other whales.\n\nDaniela Rus, director of CSAIL and professor at MIT, emphasized the significance of their findings.\n\nShe explained that this research challenges the belief that complex communication systems are unique to humans and shows that sperm whales have sophisticated ways of conveying structured information through sound.\n\nThe study's implications extend beyond just understanding whale communication. It also touches on broader themes of how intelligent life forms communicate in environments vastly different from our own, drawing parallels to how we might one day interact with extraterrestrial life.\n\nDavid Gruber, leader of Project CETI and a professor at the City University of New York, highlighted the influence of Roger Payne's earlier work.\n\nPayne's discovery that whales sing helped spark the \"Save the Whales\" movement and contributed to marine conservation efforts. This current research builds on that legacy, aiming to further decipher the messages conveyed by whales.\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers plan to explore whether different elements of whale codas carry specific meanings. They are particularly interested in the \"duality of patterning,\" a linguistic feature where simple elements combine to convey complex information -- a trait once thought to be unique to human language.\n\nThis pioneering study not only deepens our understanding of one of the ocean's most enigmatic inhabitants but also paves the way for future discoveries in how other species communicate, offering a glimpse into the vast and varied languages of the animal kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Syllable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sperm whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_CETI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Project CETI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonetic transcription"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cetacea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniela_L._Rus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniela L.

'complex phonetic alphabet,' study finds", "body": "Researchers analyzed the codas of approximately 60 sperm whales.\n\nThe ways sperm whales communicate with each other may be more \"complex\" than scientists previously believed, with new research drawing similarities between the whale species' language and human phonetics.\n\nIn a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications, researchers examined a group of sperm whales in the waters surrounding the Caribbean island of Dominica, analyzing their whale calls.\n\nSperm whales -- which have the largest brains of any animal species on Earth -- can combine and modulate different clicks and rhythms to create complex calls, similar to human language, according to the study, which notes the sequences of clicks sperm whales project are called codas.\n\nThe team of researchers behind the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) contend that sperm whales' codas exhibit complexities deeper than caller identity, however, the information of the calls remains undetermined.\n\n\"Sperm whale vocalizations are more expressive and structured than previously believed, and built from a repertoire comprising nearly an order of magnitude more distinguishable codas,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\nAnalyzing the codas of approximately 60 sperm whales through the Dominica Sperm Whale Project, the current largest sperm whale data repository, researchers have determined the building blocks of a \"phonetic alphabet\" that they believe sperm whales use to communicate.\n\nThe researchers analyzed a set of data comprising 8,719 codas, explaining that each coda consists of click groups generally less than two seconds in duration.\n\nPrevious research characterized coda collections by examining single codas outside the context in which they were produced, according to the study, however, researchers say \"codas are not produced in isolation but in interactive exchanges between two or more chorusing whales.\"\n\nThe interacting choruses of codas led researchers to believe the sperm whales were engaging in a dialog that could be comparable to a human conversation or the transmission of Morse Code.\n\n\"Sperm whale vocalizations demonstrate complexity on two different timescales: a fine-grained time scale that determines the makeup of each individual coda, and a longer time scale that determines the overall structure of the interactive exchange across codas within a chorus,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"While the communicative function of many codas remains an open question, our results show that the sperm whale communication system is, in principle, capable of representing a large space of possible meanings, using similar mechanisms to those employed by human sound production and representation systems,\" the authors said.\n\nSperm whales are deep divers, commonly reaching a depth of 1,150 feet and remaining underwater for an hour or more before returning to the surface to breathe for around ten minutes, according to Britannica.\n\nSperm whales are the largest of the toothed whales and have one of the widest global distributions of any marine mammal species, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which notes they are found in all deep oceans around the world.\n\nThe sperm whale is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, according to NOAA.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

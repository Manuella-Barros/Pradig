{"id": 243246730, "title": "Amid brain drain, fake doctors wreak havoc on vulnerable citizens", "text": "In this feature, VICTOR AYENI examines the spate of unqualified and unlicensed medical professionals whose quackery has unleashed pain, suffering, and death on hapless citizens as the country struggles with a massive brain drain in the health sector On a typical day, Tayo Shakirudeen gets up from his bed early, carefully donning his lab coat as he prepares to go to his clinic, Skylink Medical Centre, located at Ako-Okuta, Elepe-Ikorodu in Lagos. To the residents of the area where the facility is situated, the 37-year-old was a \u2018Medical Director\u2019, with six staff members in his employ and was frequently consulted by patients who sought treatment for various ailments. What many of those who beat the path of the bush to his clinic did not imagine was that the native of Abeokuta, Ogun State, was astute in the act of duplicity, pretending to be a qualified medical doctor. For three years, Shakirudeen maintained this facade, seamlessly blending into the hospital environment and successfully convincing everyone around him that he was a certified medical professional. But early this year, Shakirudeen\u2019s carefully constructed edifice of deceit collapsed on him like a ton of bricks when one of the patients on whom he had performed a surgery returned three months later to his facility with the police. Acting on an intelligence report from the Elepe community, last month, operatives of the Zonal Anti-Piracy Unit under the leadership of the Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 2 Command, Onikan, Olatoye Durosinmi, arrested the father of three for operating in the office of a medical doctor under false certification. During a search of the suspect\u2019s clinic, a team of detectives recovered two suspected forged certificates \u2013 Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, and Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria \u2013 both of which he confessed to having obtained electronically. The suspect also revealed that his actual educational qualification is the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination which he obtained from Majidun Grammar School, Lagos. Responding to questions from journalists, Shakirudeen said, \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing as a doctor for three years and I own Skylink Medical Centre where we give general treatments for malaria, typhoid, and infections. I also carried out appendicitis surgery. \u201cThis is the first (appendicitis surgery) I tried but I have worked somewhere before as a Nursing Assistant at a hospital located in Ojokoro, along Ikorodu Road. I worked there for two and a half years before I opened Skylink \u201cThat MBBS certificate in Medicine and Surgery from Obafemi Awolowo University (Osun State) was forged. Nobody taught me but I used to help my boss then when he was performing surgery.\u201d Describing the steps a doctor is expected to before and during a surgery, the suspect mentioned \u201cthe checking of vital signs and an abdominal scan and after the confirmation, you conduct a Packed Cell Volume and you prepare the patient for the surgery. \u201cYou clean the patient\u2019s stomach with an antiseptic and water. So after that, you give an anesthetic injection before starting the surgery. During the surgery, you use a surgical blade to dissect the stomach. If it\u2019s the appendix, after opening the stomach, then you cut the appendix. \u201cAfter cutting the stomach, you suture the appendix and suture the fat, and the skin, then you pack it with gauze and apply plaster.\u201d Commenting on these remarks made by Shakirudeen, a medical professional, Dr Donald Aniekwe, noted, \u201cOnly non-medics will be impressed by what he\u2019s saying. It\u2019s very easy to spot a fake doctor in a conversation.\u201d Recounting what led to his arrest, Shakirudeen added, \u201cAfter performing a surgery, the patient came with the police after three months to arrest me. There were no complications (after the surgery) and I often charge N150,000. I have six workers. \u201cI regret every bit of my actions and if there is anyone that is still hiding somewhere and doing the same thing, they should please desist from it.\u201d While the suspect was paraded, Durosinmi noted that the facility had been sealed for further investigation, adding that out of the six staff in the hospital, two were trained nurses while four were amateurs (auxiliary nurses). \u201cHe worked as a Nursing Assistant at Fabo Medical Centre in the Majidun area of Lagos before establishing his hospital and he has successfully carried out three surgeries: two Caesarean Sections and one appendicitis, during his three years of unlawful practice as a medical practitioner,\u201d the AIG added. Pregnant patient dies At about the same time Shakirudeen was arrested, another suspected quack doctor, Saheed Oladiti, was arrested by the Osun State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps over the death of a pregnant woman in Ororuwo town. Saturday PUNCH gathered that the 32-year-old SSCE holder allegedly delivered the woman of a baby, after which she developed complications leading to her eventual demise. The spokesperson for the Osun NSCDC, Kehinde Adeleke, disclosed that the suspect had been operating an unlicensed clinic in Ororuwo for over six years and two months. Adeleke also revealed that the suspect was training medical personnel at the cost of N5,000 per trainee. The NSCDC spokesperson added, \u201cAccording to him, the pregnant woman could not continue her antenatal care at her previous hospital because she had a misunderstanding with her husband. The self\u2013acclaimed doctor said he checked her blood pressure which was low and gave her some drugs. He thereafter asked her to come back whenever she fell into labour. \u201cOn Thursday, April 18, 2024, the woman began to experience labour symptoms and was in the hospital, where she delivered a baby. The victim developed some complications shortly after and was later rushed to a nearby licensed hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival.\u201d Proliferation of quacks According to the National Library of Medicine, a quack is \u201csomeone who does not have a professional qualification, formal registration from a legitimated institution, or required knowledge of a particular branch of medicine but practices in the field of medicine.\u201d Saturday PUNCH gathered that the activities of quacks parading themselves as medical professionals have been traced by authorities to 130 health facilities across the country being run by unlicensed doctors. In November 2023, the Ogun State Government sealed up 10 unapproved medical facilities located in the Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, led the medical team comprising personnel of the Hospital Services Department of the ministry, the Nigerian Medical Association, and others to the LGA. The team inspected private hospitals and other medical facilities in Ado-Odo/Ota, where six persons were reportedly arrested for quackery and handed over to the police. One of the major factors contributing to the proliferation of quacks, it was gathered, was the lack of funding and infrastructure, which has led a growing number of Nigerian physicians and nurses to migrate to Europe and North America, seeking better salaries and working circumstances. Six out of ten Nigerian doctors have been estimated to plan to leave the country for better opportunities, according to the Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors. Data provided by the NMA also indicated that only 24,000 licensed medical doctors are currently available in Nigeria, whereas the country requires a pool of 23 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 10,000 people to deliver essential health services, as recommended by the World Health Organisation. Exploiting these gaps and public trust in healthcare systems more quacks have begun posing as medical professionals without proper qualifications or certifications and are known to offer medical services ranging from surgeries to diagnostic procedures, often at lower costs, attracting vulnerable individuals. This was the case of one Echi Michael, a graduate of Banking and Finance, who was apprehended by the Nigerian Medical Association in Rivers State in March, after practising as a medical doctor for over two years. The NMA, in a statement signed by the state Secretary, Dr Hope Avundaa, said Michael, who graduated from Cross River State University of Technology, was nabbed by its anti-quackery committee. Avundaa disclosed that the suspect was exposed when he fraudulently applied for the NMA Rivers State Identity Card with fake documents, including a fake MBBS Certificate from the University of Port Harcourt in 2017, and a fake MDCN full registration certificate in 2023 which were found to be falsified. The statement read, \u201cMr Echi Michael was apprehended today after a period of active surveillance when he appeared for an interview for the post of Medical Officer at Port Harcourt Military Hospital, a place he has paraded himself as a staff during his application for NMA ID Card.\u201d He added that Michael would be prosecuted, saying, \u201cThe culprit has been arrested for prosecution. We thank the authorities of the military hospital for their cooperation.\u201d Suspect evades detection by changing name In March, the Plateau State chapter of the NMA said it had apprehended a fake doctor who operated under different names for allegedly conducting medical treatments in schools and places of worship across the state. The state Chairman of the NMA, Dr Bapigaan Audu, in a statement, said the suspect went by names including George Ossai and Kelvin Paul and was detected following an investigation jointly conducted by the association and officials from the state\u2019s Ministry of Health. It was reported that the suspect was subsequently transferred to the police headquarters in Jos, where he was detained. The statement partly read, \u201cThe impostor, who goes by the names \u2018George Ossai\u2019 and \u2018Kelvin Paul,\u2019 was apprehended on Monday, March 18, 2024, within the Jos metropolis and was transferred to the CID, Police Headquarters, Jos, the following day. The NMA chairman has provided a statement to the police regarding the matter, while further investigations are ongoing.\u201d Patient\u2019s kidney missing after surgery In September 2023, the family of Mrs Kehinde Kamal of Rikkos community, Jos North Local Government Area, Plateau State, raised an alarm over her missing kidney after she underwent surgery performed by Dr Noah Kekere of Murna Clinic and Maternity in Jos. The suspect, popularly known as \u201cYellow,\u201d Kekere was said to have attracted a lot of patronage from the community due to his affable disposition towards his patients. However, the 45-year-old mother of four, lamented how she suffered severe pains since 2018 when she underwent surgery for appendicitis and a medical examination later revealed her kidney was missing. Mrs Kehinde said Dr Kekere has been their family doctor for years and when she consulted him over a stomach problem, he told her she needed to undergo surgery to remove her appendix. \u201cBecause we trusted him, my husband paid the bill of N80,000 and the surgery was carried out successfully. But shortly after I was discharged from the hospital, I started experiencing a very strange pain in my abdomen and my husband said I should go back to the doctor for examination. \u201cSo I went and the doctor gave me some drugs to relieve the pains, but the pains kept going and coming. Each time the doctor gave me drugs to relieve the pain, I would only experience relief for a few days and the pain would return even more severe. \u201cI was having sleepless nights due to the pain, then the doctor said I should come for another surgery and gave us a bill of N60,000. At that point, my husband and I decided to go to the University of Jos Teaching Hospital for an advanced medical examination. \u201cTo our surprise, we discovered at JUTH that one of my kidneys had been removed. I was shocked and confused at the discovery that my kidney was missing. The only thing that came to my mind was the hospital where I had surgery in 2018, and that is our family doctor, Noah Kekere.\u201d Reacting to the issue, the branch chairman of NMA, Dr Bapigaan Audu, said, \u201cOur records do not show that the person accused is a medical doctor. What we have at our secretariat and the investigation we have carried out is that Dr Kekere is not our member.\u201d The Plateau State Police Command later arrested Kekere for allegedly removing Kamal\u2019s kidney, according to a statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer, Alfred Alabo. Cover blown during interview In the case of Abawulor Omenka, he was apprehended by the Association of Nigerian Private Medical Practitioners while trying to apply as a medical officer at the Covenant University Medical Centre, Ota, in the Sango area of Ogun State. According to PUNCH Healthwise, Omenka had applied for the position of a Medical Officer and reportedly presented fake credentials, which included a photocopy of the MDCN registration certificate issued in 2015. The 35-year-old suspect also presented a certificate from the Benue State University where he claimed to have obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery, and graduated with a Second Class Upper Division. It was gathered that the suspect, who works as an auxiliary nurse at some private hospitals, was caught during a job interview held at the CUMC in August 2023. The Chairman of the Association of General and Private Medical Practitioners in Ogun State, Dr Kayode Oyelade disclosed that Omenka was caught after doctors who conducted the interview discovered he did not have full knowledge of the profession. Oyelade revealed that when some of the hospitals where the suspect claimed to have worked were contacted, Omenka was identified as a health assistant by his former employees. \u201cWe asked him about the courses he did in the university, and he was just saying things he knew nothing about. We discovered in the course of our interview that he has an idea because he has worked in some hospitals as an auxiliary nurse,\u201d he stated. He added, \u201cWhat gave him up were the certificates he presented. Omenka presented a photocopied certificate he claimed to have obtained from the university with a Second Upper Division in Medicine and Surgery. \u201cIf you are conversant with a medical certificate, you will know there is nothing like grade. When you are given a certificate as a doctor, it will just be specified that you have passed when you certify the examiner. There is nothing like first class or second class. Our certificate is not graded. Immediately, he presented that, and we knew it was fake. \u201cHe also presented a certificate he claimed to have got from MDCN, we saw that one and we just laughed. The registration number is 11,641. I graduated 32 years ago from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and my number is 20,815. \u201cAnd someone who claimed to have graduated in 2015 is 11,000, which means he graduated before me. I am sure that some of the people with that number are dead now. We called one of the doctors again and he told us that this is not the first time he would be involved in such a thing.\u201d Oyelade further revealed that the suspect had been handed over to the police at Onipanu Police Station, Ota, and would be charged in court. Medical school dropout fakes licence On November 26, 2022, the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, in a tweet posted on his official X account said an unidentified 26-year-old who paraded as a doctor was exposed by residents. \u201cThe 26-year-old faked a medical license in his name and has been practicing as a medical doctor since January 2022. He dropped out after some years of studying Medicine. \u201cCommendation goes to public-spirited Lagosians who spotted him and promptly informed the police. You have saved lives. If you see something, say something!\u201d he wrote. Commenting on the case, an X user, Paul Darlington, lamented the lack of appropriate channels to report such quacks operating in communities. He said, \u201cNMA is the cause. There is no channel to report these criminals. I know one and I have been looking for ways to report him for years now. He has been working as a medical doctor for years. \u201cI heard he trained as an auxiliary nurse. He now owns a hospital. I reported him to the police but they referred me to the NMA.\u201d An Ikorodu resident, Damilola Ajayi told Saturday PUNCH that there are quack doctors he knew who operated in his area. \u201cThere is still more to be done because I know two quack doctors in this place and people too know them. What they do is surround themselves in their workplace with auxiliary nurses and these are not qualified nurses. \u201cNow, each time you go to such health facilities, you are taking a huge risk with your health because they could give you the wrong dose, or perform a wrong medical procedure or render you physically disabled or you may die of their medical negligence or ignorance,\u201d he noted. On July 21, 2020, the official X account of the Medical Rehabilitation Therapists Board of Nigeria, shared a screenshot of one David Nwaimoh who had the term \u201cTraditional physiotherapist\u201d attached to his name. The post said, \u201cKindly disregard and report professional impersonators like this. The public should please take note, that there is no such thing as \u201cTraditional Physiotheraphy.\u201d A physiotherapist in the replies, Kamil Adedeji observed that, \u201cPetroleum Engineer, then traditional physiotherapist, and swallowed leg. This is so ridiculous. It\u2019s not impossible that this criminal has been scamming unsuspecting Nigerians for so long.\u201d In response, Nwaimoh posted an apology, \u201cI want to use this medium to apologise to MRTB Nigeria for the wrong choice of words, \u2018Traditional Physiotherapy,\u2019 I used here. It wasn\u2019t my intention to rubbish this noble profession. We learn every day. Thanks and God bless the Federal Republic (of) Nigeria. Long live MRTB Nigeria.\u201d Another response from an X user, Physiotherapy Place, read, \u201cThere is no apology here. Just edit your profile to be true so (as) not to rubbish yourself and innocent and unsuspecting followers.\u201d Stakeholders vow to arrest culprits In its reaction, the Chairman of NMA in Lagos State, Dr Benjamin Olowojebutu, described medical quackery as a dangerous practice that posed a threat to the well-being of citizens. \u201cThe arrest of Shakirudeen is a welcome development to the health sector; we would expose these quack doctors and ensure that Lagos does not suffer further morbidity and mortality from their nefarious activities. \u201cWe are glad that our work on anti-quackery has started yielding progress as we are determined to weed out quacks from the medical profession.\u201d Olowojebutu also warned hospital management to avoid employing staff members whose medical licence had not been verified by the MDCN so as to safeguard public health. He added that the NMA Lagos will work in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the Health Monitoring and Accreditation Agency, and the police to stop the proliferation of quack doctors in the state. A family physician at Anambra State Ministry of Health, Dr Chidumeje Okafor, faulted the employment of auxiliary nurses to perform roles and procedures that they do not have the skills for. He said, \u201cI saw a viral video of a woman who went for Caesarean Section delivery and a big towel used during the procedure was left inside her belly in Kaduna. You need to see the size of the towel brought out of this woman\u2019s belly. She had this operation in another facility. \u201cThere is no procedure of such that would require a towel of that size. Quackery is the worst calamity to befall us. We shall all soon be victims of quackery if the government chooses not to act fast. Soon, you will see herbalists giving drip to patients, leaving out their herbs and roots procedure.\u201d Speaking to Saturday PUNCH, a lawyer, Isaac Audu, described the spike in quacks as a consequence of citizens, especially in the rural areas, who have few established choices in seeking healthcare. \u201cUnqualified doctors, unlicensed facilities carrying on for years without being fished out signals a level of dysfunction that needs to be examined. First of all, these quack medical professionals offer a comparatively cheaper cost of healthcare so they tend to get more patronage due to the current economic problems. \u201cIn some communities, the people don\u2019t know any better, once they see someone wearing a lab coat or a nurse uniform, they viscerally assume you are qualified to prescribe medications for them or give them injections and that is where the problem starts. So the authorities need to conduct investigations and citizens need to speak up and break the jinx of silence. \u201cAdditionally, the lack of health facilities in the country\u2019s rural regions often leaves patients with few options, making them more likely to unwittingly seek treatment at unlicensed clinics. Therefore, it would be good if there are adequate provisions of facilities in primary healthcare centres that are utilised in rural communities,\u201d Audu stated.", "summary": "<p>In this feature, VICTOR AYENI examines the spate of unqualified and unlicensed medical professionals whose quackery has unleashed pain, suffering, and death on hapless citizens as the country struggles with a massive brain drain in the health sector On a typical day, Tayo Shakirudeen gets up from his bed early, carefully donning his lab coat </p>\n <br/> <a href='https://punchng.com/amid-brain-drain-fake-doctors-wreak-havoc-on-vulnerable-citizens/'>Read More</a>", "url": "https://punchng.com/amid-brain-drain-fake-doctors-wreak-havoc-on-vulnerable-citizens/", "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/28215016/fake-doctors.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:44:24", "author": "Victor Ayeni", "authors": ["Victor Ayeni"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.343}

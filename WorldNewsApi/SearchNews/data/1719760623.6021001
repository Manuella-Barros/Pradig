Honestly, I had no idea it was me,\" Nea told Newsweek.Later that evening, she was sitting in her apartment, and it hit her. Nea has an olive tree in her house that she has set up with an LED lamp to keep it growing and healthy. Positioned near the window, it is visible from outside.The uncommon indoor plant, combined with the conspicuous light, led her neighbors to suspect illegal activity. Artificial lighting is often used to grow drugs, particularly cannabis, indoors, mimicking the natural sunlight that plants need for photosynthesis and optimal growth.\"I immediately posted a picture in our housing association's chat that if anyone was wondering, I have an olive tree by the window. Later on, I found out that someone had contacted the authorities and then pulled back their report after seeing it was a misunderstanding,\" Nea said.In Sweden, marijuana is illegal for both recreational and medical use. The country has some of the strictest drug laws in Europe: Sweden's drug policy is well known for its zero-tolerance approach. Growing marijuana in Sweden can lead to severe penalties, including significant prison time.Nea shared the story on TikTok where it has been viewed more than 300,000 times and left people laughing.\"Neighbors need to mind their business,\" said viewer Em.User immeadow_xx said: \"Ahhh magic olives, my favorite illegal plant.\"Viewers from other countries where growing marijuana is legal struggled to relate. TikTok user Elia said: \"Confused in German - it is legal here.\" El Mitador joked: \"My Dutch a** sitting here like but isn't three plants legal?\"Nea was amused by the response to her viral video, and how many people agreed that it was funny. She said: \"I shared it because I thought it was a funny misunderstanding. The response has been lightweight and fun.\"", "summary": "When Nea heard rumors in her apartment building, she was shocked to find out they were about her.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/neighbors-call-cops-over-what-they-see-windownot-prepared-truth-1905676", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400413/nea-tiktok.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:23:02", "author": "Alice Gibbs", "authors": ["Alice Gibbs"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.125}

Limerick\u2019s William O'Donoghue, Cathal O'Neill and Cian Lynch tackle Neil Montgomery of Waterford. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO It was not as nervy as last year\u2019s one-point success over Cork, Limerick achieving victory here in the end with greater comfort as they had ten to spare over Waterford at the finish. But it was still a game which had anxious moments for the champions, their struggles to put Waterford away were compounded by their opponents resilience. Shane Bennett\u2019s second goal of the game arrived in the 46th minute and that sparked a mini-revival for his team. When substitute Patrick Fitzgerald knocked over a 55th minute score the gap had been pared to two, but Limerick stood tall from there and outscored Waterford 0-9 to 0-1 in the remainder of the action. Another instalment of their Munster final rivalry with Clare now awaits, Waterford\u2019s interest in this year\u2019s championship extinguished by defeats over the past two Sundays.

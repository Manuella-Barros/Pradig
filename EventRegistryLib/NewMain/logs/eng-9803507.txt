While Indian athletes are performing their best to make India proud globally, Neeraj Chopra recently won a silver medal for India at the javelin throw final. Now, a video has surfaced on social media which shows Neeraj meeting Jr Bachchan after his win.\n\nThe viral video begins with Neeraj Chopra walking out of the stadium, wrapped in a tricolour. He notices Abhishek Bachchan and meets him. The Ghoomer actor hugs Chopra and congratulates him. Abhishek even pats on Neeraj's back. Watch the video here:\n\nPreviously, Abhishek Bachchan also took to his Instagram handle and shared a photo in which he was seen smiling for the camera while holding the Indian National Flag. Abhishek was dressed casually yet stylishly, wearing an orange shirt over a white tee, paired with light blue jeans. His signature yellow-rimmed glasses added a pop of colour to his look. The actor appeared to be in high spirits, fully immersed in the excitement of the games.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that Abhishek is attending the Olympics in Paris alone, while his actress-wife Aishwarya Rai and daughter Aaradhya are in India. Lately, the couple's separate appearances at high-profile events have only left netizens wondering if all is well between the two. Last month, Abhishek attended Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding with his parents, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, and his sister Shweta Bachchan's family. On the other hand, Aishwarya arrived at the event separately with Aaradhya, which raised more eyebrows.\n\nMeanwhile, Abhishek Bachchan is not the only actor who congratulated Neeraj Chopra. Recently, Vicky Kaushal also shared Chopra's image from the Javelin throw final and wrote, \"Season best performance. You always make us proud brother!!!\" Bollywood actress Rakul Preet Singh also congratulated the javelin star and wrote, \"Woohoo! Neeraj, you've done it again!

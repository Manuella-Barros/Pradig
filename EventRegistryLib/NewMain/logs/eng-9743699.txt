But on Wednesday night, Gazzetta dello Sport reported Soule has definitively decided Roma is his next destination and that he has no desire to move to City nor West Ham, the other Premier League side credited with interest.\n\nREAD MORE: Leicester City notebook: Transfer horizons expanding as loan plea made and Callum Doyle moves on\n\nREAD MORE: Join our City WhatsApp group and get news sent to your phone\n\nThe Italian capital is just an hour from where Soule spent last season, on loan at Frosinone, while he has friends already at Roma in fellow Argentinians Paulo Dybala and Leandro Paredes. It's said he feels it would be easier to integrate into life at Roma than it would be to do so in England.\n\nAll that is needed is an agreement between Roma and Juventus and the capital club have now submitted a bid of \u20ac25m plus \u20ac5m in bonuses. That's the same offer City were reported to have made.\n\nFor City, their attention now turns to other targets. Among wingers, they have been linked with AC Milan's Belgian international Alexis Saelemaekers, while in attacking midfield they have been credited with interest in Celtic's Matt O'Riley.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Whilst Arne Slot's work on the training ground looks promising, the overwhelming feeling is that Liverpool are missing out on a number of opportunities to sign players.\n\nThere's no doubt that this has been enhanced by Manchester United's capture of 18-year-old defender Leny Yoro from Lille, for around \u00a345million. However, there is another 'opportunistic' signing that could be available for the Reds to hijack - but they would have to act quickly to pull it off.\n\nThat player is Juventus' Matias Soule, who is expected to leave the Serie A giants this summer. Leicester City are reportedly leading the race to sign the 21-year-old in a deal worth just \u00a325million.\n\nSoule is a 21-year-old Argentine right-winger, often deployed as an inverted winger more than capable of cutting in onto his favoured left-foot in a similar way to Mohamed Salah. The youngster enjoyed a really impressive season on loan at Frosinone last season, scoring 11 goals and assisting a further three in 36 league appearances for the Italian side.\n\nHowever, with just two years left on his current deal at Juventus and with them struggling financially he is expected to leave this summer for a cut-price. That same situation has seen the likes of Federico Chiesa also looking for a new club and also being linked to Liverpool.\n\nWhen discussing potential areas for improvement in Liverpool's current squad, you would be correct to point out the need for a backup and alternative option in the right-wing position, which Soule would definitely offer. Especially with the ageing Mohamed Salah, who struggled with injuries at certain points in the 2023/24 season, the need for a potential long-term replacement is growing in need.\n\nAs briefly mentioned above, Soule would fit the style of Liverpool's typical profile of winger. As an inverted, quick and skilful winger with an eye for goal, it's perhaps a surprise to see Liverpool and other top European clubs not more interested in the youngster.\n\nAnother sticking point on every transfer is the injury history of the player, which Soule passes very comfortably having only missed one game through injury since February 2020.\n\nAs mentioned before, Leicester City are currently the favourites to sign Soule in a \u00a325million deal. Serie A rivals, AS Roma are also tipped to be interested in signing the Argentine winger. With that in consideration, I have no doubt that the player would jump at the opportunity of signing for Liverpool, even without the guarantee of a constant slot in the starting eleven.\n\nAt a price of \u00a325million, the Reds could definitely afford the deal and would prove a much cheaper option than the likes of Leeds United's Crysencio Summerville (\u00a345m) and PSV's Johan Bakayoko (\u00a350m), who have both been linked with a move to Liverpool earlier this window.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosinone_Calcio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frosinone Calcio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysencio_Summerville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crysencio Summerville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The midfielder has been linked with the Reds throughout the summer.\n\nJuventus, however, are said to be the Dutchman's preferred destination, having agreed personal terms with the Italian giants. Atalanta are said to want a fee of \u20ac60 million (\u00a350m) for the midfielder this summer, but could reduce the asking price to \u20ac55 million (\u00a346m) or even an initial fee of \u20ac40 million (\u00a333.5m).\n\nThis is where the problem could come in for Juventus. It has been reported by Fabrizio Romano that Juve will make their official bid for the player as soon as they complete a sale of Matias Soule to help raise funds.\n\nLeicester City and Roma are said to be battling it out for the 21-year-old. There is a lot of talk in the Italian press over what is happening surrounding Soule's future, with Gazzetta dello Sport reporting that Roma have made an offer of \u20ac25 million (\u00a321m) plus bonuses, the same as Leicester's initial offer.\n\nIt has previously been said that Leicester are willing to offer more and Juventus prefer to sell to the Foxes due to better economic conditions and the fact that they won't be selling to a rival. However, Gazzetta adds that Soule prefers to stay in Italy and join Roma.\n\nThat has led to somewhat of a transfer stand-off between the three clubs over the winger. It's something that Liverpool could possibly take advantage of.\n\nWhile Juve are waiting for the sale, the Reds could possibly nip in and try to convince Koopmeiners to change his mind over where his future lies. If they are able to agree a fee with Atalanta, then they could set up a transfer while Juve still waits for the sale of Soule to go through.\n\nAs with any transfer situation, things can change quickly.

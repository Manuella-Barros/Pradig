After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards, five by each team.\n\nPujols' two-run drive was 609th, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the career. Pujols and Sosa now share the distinction of hitting more home runs that any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game. Darren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nRED SOX 9, YANKEES 6\n\nPinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a two-run single in Boston's four-run seventh inning and the Red Sox rallied to beat New York.\n\nBoston won for the 13th time in 15 games to extend its lead in the AL East to five games over the second-place Yankees. New York had won four straight.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4). Mookie Betts had a sacrifice fly and Andrew Benintendi an RBI single. After Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again, Moreland's single made it 7-6. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a two-run single in the eighth.\n\nDODGERS 8, TIGERS 5\n\nChris Taylor was 4 for 5 with two doubles, and the Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed back Adrian Gonzalez from the disabled list with a victory over Detroit.\n\nGonzalez doubled in his first plate appearance since June 11, one of six two-base hits on the night for Los Angeles. The Dodgers (86-34) have won 20 of their last 23 games and are 51-9 over their last 60.\n\nRich Hill (9-4) labored through five innings, allowing three runs and six hits, but the Dodgers gave him plenty of support. Corey Seager drove in three runs, and Logan Forsythe scored three times.\n\nJustin Upton homered twice and Victor Martinez also went deep for the Tigers, but Jordan Zimmermann (7-10) allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nGonzalez was activated before the game after being out with a herniated lumbar disk.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 37 consecutive games in which they've scored four or more runs.\n\nCUBS 7, BLUE JAYS 4\n\nJake Arrieta pitched into the seventh inning and allowed a run, and Javier Baez homered and drove in three runs to help Chicago beat Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings to win his third straight start. Wade Davis got the final three outs for his 25th save.\n\nAnthony Rizzo went 2 for 4 with two RBIs, Victor Caratini went 3 for 3, and Jason Heyward and Albert Almora Jr. each had an RBI single for Chicago.\n\nBlue Jays starter J.A. Happ (6-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in five innings. Miguel Montero, who began the season with the Cubs, went 2 for 4 with a run scored against his former team.\n\nCARDINALS 11, PIRATES 10\n\nMatt Carpenter hit a three-run homer in the second inning to make it 5-1 and St. Louis went on to outscore Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals, whose lead reached 11-3 in the eighth inning, have taken the first two games of a four-game series against the Pirates to remain 1 1/2 games behind the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs.\n\nSt. Louis has won 10 of its past 13 games despite losing three straight from Aug. 13-16. It has scored at least eight runs in eight of those 10 wins.\n\nTommy Pham homered in the first inning to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead and Paul DeJong made it 6-2 with a solo shot in the third. St. Louis scored two runs in the fourth inning to take an 8-2 lead and chase Pirates starter Trevor Williams (5-6). Pittsburgh has lost six straight.\n\nRight-hander Carlos Martinez (10-9) allowed three runs and six hits with four strikeouts for the win. Right-hander Seung Hwan Oh picked up his 19th save.\n\nASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 1\n\nDallas Keuchel threw seven shutout innings, Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve homered and Houston beat Oakland.\n\nKeuchel (11-2) allowed three hits, walked one and struck out three. He had his second straight solid outing after allowing one run in 6 2/3 innings Sunday at Texas.\n\nThe 2015 AL Cy Young winner retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, with the lone hit being a bunt single by Matt Joyce down the third-base line and away from the shift in the third inning. Of the 21 outs Keuchel recorded, 16 came on ground balls.\n\nBregman and Altuve hit back-to-back home runs in the third to give Houston a 2-0 lead. Bregman hit his 14th of the season to right field, and Altuve hit his 19th into the Crawford Boxes in left.\n\nKen Giles recorded the final five outs for his 24th save.\n\nJoyce, who was also walked by Keuchel, hit a solo home run in the eighth off Chris Devenski.\n\nSean Manaea (8-8) lost his third straight.\n\nROCKIES 8, BREWERS 4\n\nCharlie Blackmon hit his sixth leadoff home run of the season, German Marquez won for the first time in three weeks and Colorado beat Milwaukee.\n\nGerardo Parra and Carlos Gonzalez also homered and each drove in two runs, and Nolan Arenado had a two-run triple for the Rockies. They are a game ahead of Arizona for the top NL wild card.\n\nMarquez (10-5) allowed four runs -- including three solo shots -- in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies took the lead with a three-run third. Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple and Parra followed with a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead 4-2. Parra added a solo homer and Gonzalez's two-run shot a batter later chased Brewers starter Matt Garza (6-7) in the fifth.\n\nTWINS 10, DIAMONDBACKS 3\n\nMiguel Sano hit two of the Twins' season high-tying six home runs, including an inside-the-park dash by Byron Buxton, and Minnesota powered past Arizona.\n\nEduardo Escobar, Max Kepler and Brian Dozier also went deep for Minnesota. Buxton finished a single shy of the cycle.\n\nDavid Peralta had three hits for Arizona, including a home run.\n\nWith Minnesota leading 4-3 in the seventh, Sano hit the first pitch from reliever David Hernandez 452 feet into the second deck in left-center for two runs. Escobar added a two-run shot two batters later.\n\nSano hit one even further, 474 feet into the third deck, in the eighth for his first multi-homer game this season and third of his career.\n\nBuxton hit a ball high off the wall in right-center in the fourth that rolled toward center field. As A.J. Pollock gave chase, Buxton circled the bases in 13.85 seconds, the fastest ever tracked by MLB Statcast, narrowly beating the throw by sliding headfirst across home plate.\n\nMinnesota also hit six home runs May 2 against Oakland.\n\nArizona starter Zack Godley (5-6) tied a career high by striking out 10, but allowed four earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. Twins starter Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits in six innings. All the runs came in the first two innings.\n\nNATIONALS 7, PADRES 1\n\nMatt Grace pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings in place of injured Max Scherzer, and Howie Kendrick hit a leadoff homer and drove in two runs to help Washington beat San Diego.\n\nScherzer was scratched from his scheduled start and placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sore neck. Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one. He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and manager Dusty Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nShawn Kelley came on and with one out allowed Dusty Coleman's solo homer into the second deck in left field, his fourth. Joe Blanton (2-2) pitched a scoreless sixth for the win.\n\nKendrick homered to left on the third pitch from Luis Perdomo (6-8), his sixth leadoff shot this season and seventh homer overall.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 1\n\nNelson Cruz hit his 30th homer and doubled twice, and Erasmo Ramirez won his first game for Seattle since April 1, 2014, lead the Mariners past Tampa Bay.\n\nCruz's home run was measured by MLB Statcast at 482 feet, the longest in Tropicana Field history.\n\nRamirez (5-4), who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings in the first game of the Mariners' 12-game trip.\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt (6-4).\n\nINDIANS 10, ROYALS 1\n\nCorey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle, and Jay Bruce homered twice to help Cleveland rout Kansas City.\n\nKluber (12-3) was cruising along until there was one out in the sixth inning, and Eric Hosmer sent a grounder to the right side of the infield. Kluber winced coming off the mound to cover the bag.\n\nThe two-time All-Star faced one more batter before Andrew Miller relieved him. Kluber allowed a homer to Brandon Moss along with five more hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nJason Kipnis and Bruce took Ian Kennedy (4-9) deep in the first inning, and Bruce added a three-run shot in the seventh to finish with five RBIs.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion hit the Indians' fourth homer of the night leading off the ninth.\n\nWHITE SOX 4, RANGERS 3\n\nNicky Delmonico lined an inside-the-park home run in the eighth inning, his second go-ahead homer of the game, and Chicago beat Texas to end a five-game losing streak.\n\nDelmonico's fifth homer eluded a leaping Nomar Mazara, bouncing off the wall as the right fielder crumpled on the warning track clutching his left knee. Second baseman Rougned Odor sprinted to retrieve the long carom, but Delmonico beat the throw with a head-first slide.\n\nA day after the end of the rookie's club-record streak of reaching base the first 13 games of his career, Delmonico drilled a two-run shot over the wall in right for a 3-2 lead in the sixth.\n\nMike Napoli's 25th homer put Texas ahead 2-1 in the fourth.\n\nGregory Infante (1-1) retired all five batters he faced for his first big league win, and Juan Minaya pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his first save in his first chance in the majors.\n\nRicky Rodriguez (0-1) was greeted by Delmonico's inside-the-park homer in his third big league appearance.\n\nREDS 5, BRAVES 3\n\nCincinnati hit three home runs in the sixth, including a two-run shot by Adam Duvall, Sal Romano threw seven strong innings and the Reds beat R.A. Dickey and Atlanta.\n\nMatt Adams' homer in the second inning gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead that Dickey held until the four-run sixth. Duvall's homer drove in Joey Votto, who hit a leadoff single, to give the Reds the lead.\n\nEugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker added back-to-back homers with one out for Cincinnati's first three-homer inning of the season.\n\nRomano (3-5) snapped a streak of three straight losses in August. The rookie right-hander was dominant after giving up a second-inning homer to Adams. He allowed one run and five hits in his longest of nine starts in the majors. Rasiel Iglesias pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.\n\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwback uniforms to launch their Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend. The 83-year-old Aaron and wife Billye took an open-convertible ride around the field in a pregame ceremony.\n\nGIANTS 10, PHILLIES 2\n\nMatt Moore took a one-hitter into the eighth inning and picked up his first win in nearly two months, leading San Francisco past Philadelphia.\n\nHunter Pence and Brandon Crawford homered, Pablo Sandoval had an RBI single and Denard Span added three hits and made a nice running catch in center field to help San Francisco to its ninth win in the last 12 games at AT&T Park.\n\nOne day after becoming the first team in major league history to reach 11,000 wins as a franchise, the Giants added on by beating the worst team in baseball again.\n\nMoore (4-12) was crisp in his second straight strong start despite four walks, allowing two hits over 7 1/3 innings to win for the first time since June 20. Four relievers combined for five outs to complete the four-hitter. Zach Elfin (1-5) allowed six runs on seven hits over five innings for Philadelphia.\n\nMARLINS 3, METS 1\n\nJ.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer and Miami Marlins won for the sixth time in seven games, downing New York to move within two games of .500 for the first time since May 3.\n\nRealmuto followed Marcell Ozuna's second-inning walk with his 14th home run, lining a hanging curveball into the left-field seats for a 2-0 lead.\n\nPitching in front of a sparse crowd in a game that started almost two hours late due to steady rain and the occasional burst of lightning, Justin Nicolino (2-1) scattered six singles and stranded runners in four of his five innings. Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards, five by each team.\n\nPujols' two-run drive was 609th, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the career. Pujols and Sosa now share the distinction of hitting more home runs that any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game. Darren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nBOSTON - Pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a two-run single in Boston's four-run seventh inning and the Red Sox rallied to beat New York.\n\nBoston won for the 13th time in 15 games to extend its lead in the A.L. East to five games over the second-place Yankees. New York had won four straight.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4). Mookie Betts had a sacrifice fly and Andrew Benintendi an RBI single. After Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again, Moreland's single made it 7-6. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a two-run single in the eighth.\n\nDETROIT - Chris Taylor was 4 for 5 with two doubles, and the Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed back Adrian Gonzalez from the disabled list with a victory over Detroit.\n\nGonzalez doubled in his first plate appearance since June 11, one of six two-base hits on the night for Los Angeles. The Dodgers (86-34) have won 20 of their last 23 games and are 51-9 over their last 60.\n\nRich Hill (9-4) labored through five innings, allowing three runs and six hits, but the Dodgers gave him plenty of support. Corey Seager drove in three runs, and Logan Forsythe scored three times.\n\nJustin Upton homered twice and Victor Martinez also went deep for the Tigers, but Jordan Zimmermann (7-10) allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nGonzalez was activated before the game after being out with a herniated lumbar disk.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 37 consecutive games in which they've scored four or more runs.\n\nCHICAGO - Jake Arrieta pitched into the seventh inning and allowed a run, and Javier Baez homered and drove in three runs to help Chicago beat Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings to win his third straight start. Wade Davis got the final three outs for his 25th save.\n\nAnthony Rizzo went 2 for 4 with two RBIs, Victor Caratini went 3 for 3, and Jason Heyward and Albert Almora Jr. each had an RBI single for Chicago.\n\nBlue Jays starter J.A. Happ (6-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in five innings. Miguel Montero, who began the season with the Cubs, went 2 for 4 with a run scored against his former team.\n\nPITTSBURGH - Matt Carpenter hit a three-run homer in the second inning to make it 5-1 and St. Louis went on to outscore Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals, whose lead reached 11-3 in the eighth inning, have taken the first two games of a four-game series against the Pirates to remain 1 1/2 games behind the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs.\n\nSt. Louis has won 10 of its past 13 games despite losing three straight from Aug. 13-16. It has scored at least eight runs in eight of those 10 wins.\n\nTommy Pham homered in the first inning to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead and Paul DeJong made it 6-2 with a solo shot in the third. St. Louis scored two runs in the fourth inning to take an 8-2 lead and chase Pirates starter Trevor Williams (5-6). Pittsburgh has lost six straight.\n\nRight-hander Carlos Martinez (10-9) allowed three runs and six hits with four strikeouts for the win. Right-hander Seung Hwan Oh picked up his 19th save.\n\nHOUSTON - Dallas Keuchel threw seven shutout innings, Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve homered and Houston beat Oakland.\n\nKeuchel (11-2) allowed three hits, walked one and struck out three. He had his second straight solid outing after allowing one run in 6 2/3 innings Sunday at Texas.\n\nThe 2015 AL Cy Young winner retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, with the lone hit being a bunt single by Matt Joyce down the third-base line and away from the shift in the third inning. Of the 21 outs Keuchel recorded, 16 came on ground balls.\n\nBregman and Altuve hit back-to-back home runs in the third to give Houston a 2-0 lead. Bregman hit his 14th of the season to right field, and Altuve hit his 19th into the Crawford Boxes in left.\n\nKen Giles recorded the final five outs for his 24th save.\n\nJoyce, who was also walked by Keuchel, hit a solo home run in the eighth off Chris Devenski.\n\nSean Manaea (8-8) lost his third straight.\n\nDENVER - Charlie Blackmon hit his sixth leadoff home run of the season, German Marquez won for the first time in three weeks and Colorado beat Milwaukee.\n\nGerardo Parra and Carlos Gonzalez also homered and each drove in two runs, and Nolan Arenado had a two-run triple for the Rockies. They are a game ahead of Arizona for the top NL wild card.\n\nMarquez (10-5) allowed four runs - including three solo shots - in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies took the lead with a three-run third. Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple and Parra followed with a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead 4-2. Parra added a solo homer and Gonzalez's two-run shot a batter later chased Brewers starter Matt Garza (6-7) in the fifth.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Miguel Sano hit two of the Twins' season high-tying six home runs, including an inside-the-park dash by Byron Buxton, and Minnesota powered past Arizona.\n\nEduardo Escobar, Max Kepler and Brian Dozier also went deep for Minnesota. Buxton finished a single shy of the cycle.\n\nDavid Peralta had three hits for Arizona, including a home run.\n\nWith Minnesota leading 4-3 in the seventh, Sano hit the first pitch from reliever David Hernandez 452 feet into the second deck in left-center for two runs. Escobar added a two-run shot two batters later.\n\nSano hit one even further, 474 feet into the third deck, in the eighth for his first multi-homer game this season and third of his career.\n\nBuxton hit a ball high off the wall in right-center in the fourth that rolled toward center field. As A.J. Pollock gave chase, Buxton circled the bases in 13.85 seconds, the fastest ever tracked by MLB Statcast, narrowly beating the throw by sliding headfirst across home plate.\n\nMinnesota also hit six home runs May 2 against Oakland.\n\nArizona starter Zack Godley (5-6) tied a career high by striking out 10, but allowed four earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. Twins starter Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits in six innings. All the runs came in the first two innings.\n\nSAN DIEGO - Matt Grace pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings in place of injured Max Scherzer, and Howie Kendrick hit a leadoff homer and drove in two runs to help Washington beat San Diego.\n\nScherzer was scratched from his scheduled start and placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sore neck. Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one. He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and manager Dusty Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nShawn Kelley came on and with one out allowed Dusty Coleman's solo homer into the second deck in left field, his fourth. Joe Blanton (2-2) pitched a scoreless sixth for the win.\n\nKendrick homered to left on the third pitch from Luis Perdomo (6-8), his sixth leadoff shot this season and seventh homer overall.\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Nelson Cruz hit his 30th homer and doubled twice, and Erasmo Ramirez won his first game for Seattle since April 1, 2014, lead the Mariners past Tampa Bay.\n\nCruz's home run was measured by MLB Statcast at 482 feet, the longest in Tropicana Field history.\n\nRamirez (5-4), who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings in the first game of the Mariners' 12-game trip.\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt (6-4).\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. - Corey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle, and Jay Bruce homered twice to help Cleveland rout Kansas City.\n\nKluber (12-3) was cruising along until there was one out in the sixth inning, and Eric Hosmer sent a grounder to the right side of the infield. Kluber winced coming off the mound to cover the bag.\n\nThe two-time All-Star faced one more batter before Andrew Miller relieved him. Kluber allowed a homer to Brandon Moss along with five more hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nJason Kipnis and Bruce took Ian Kennedy (4-9) deep in the first inning, and Bruce added a three-run shot in the seventh to finish with five RBIs.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion hit the Indians' fourth homer of the night leading off the ninth.\n\nARLINGTON, Texas - Nicky Delmonico lined an inside-the-park home run in the eighth inning, his second go-ahead homer of the game, and Chicago beat Texas to end a five-game losing streak.\n\nDelmonico's fifth homer eluded a leaping Nomar Mazara, bouncing off the wall as the right fielder crumpled on the warning track clutching his left knee. Second baseman Rougned Odor sprinted to retrieve the long carom, but Delmonico beat the throw with a head-first slide.\n\nA day after the end of the rookie's club-record streak of reaching base the first 13 games of his career, Delmonico drilled a two-run shot over the wall in right for a 3-2 lead in the sixth.\n\nMike Napoli's 25th homer put Texas ahead 2-1 in the fourth.\n\nGregory Infante (1-1) retired all five batters he faced for his first big league win, and Juan Minaya pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his first save in his first chance in the majors.\n\nRicky Rodriguez (0-1) was greeted by Delmonico's inside-the-park homer in his third big league appearance.\n\nATLANTA - Cincinnati hit three home runs in the sixth, including a two-run shot by Adam Duvall, Sal Romano threw seven strong innings and the Reds beat R.A. Dickey and Atlanta.\n\nMatt Adams' homer in the second inning gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead that Dickey held until the four-run sixth. Duvall's homer drove in Joey Votto, who hit a leadoff single, to give the Reds the lead.\n\nEugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker added back-to-back homers with one out for Cincinnati's first three-homer inning of the season.\n\nRomano (3-5) snapped a streak of three straight losses in August. The rookie right-hander was dominant after giving up a second-inning homer to Adams. He allowed one run and five hits in his longest of nine starts in the majors. Rasiel Iglesias pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.\n\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwback uniforms to launch their Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend. The 83-year-old Aaron and wife Billye took an open-convertible ride around the field in a pregame ceremony.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - Matt Moore took a one-hitter into the eighth inning and picked up his first win in nearly two months, leading San Francisco past Philadelphia.\n\nHunter Pence and Brandon Crawford homered, Pablo Sandoval had an RBI single and Denard Span added three hits and made a nice running catch in center field to help San Francisco to its ninth win in the last 12 games at AT&T Park.\n\nOne day after becoming the first team in major league history to reach 11,000 wins as a franchise, the Giants added on by beating the worst team in baseball again.\n\nMoore (4-12) was crisp in his second straight strong start despite four walks, allowing two hits over 7 1/3 innings to win for the first time since June 20. Four relievers combined for five outs to complete the four-hitter. Zach Elfin (1-5) allowed six runs on seven hits over five innings for Philadelphia.\n\nNEW YORK - J.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer and Miami Marlins won for the sixth time in seven games, downing New York to move within two games of .500 for the first time since May 3.\n\nRealmuto followed Marcell Ozuna's second-inning walk with his 14th home run, lining a hanging curveball into the left-field seats for a 2-0 lead.\n\nPitching in front of a sparse crowd in a game that started almost two hours late due to steady rain and the occasional burst of lightning, Justin Nicolino (2-1) scattered six singles and stranded runners in four of his five innings. Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.", "dateTime":

After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles' Manny Machado watches his grand slam in front of Los Angeles Angels catcher Martin Maldonado and home plate umpire Mark Ripperger during the ninth inning of a baseball game in Baltimore, Friday, Aug. 18, 2017. Baltimore won 9-7. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards, five by each team.\n\nPujols' two-run drive was 609th, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the career. Pujols and Sosa now share the distinction of hitting more home runs that any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game. Darren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nRED SOX 9, YANKEES 6\n\nBOSTON (AP) - Pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a two-run single in Boston's four-run seventh inning and the Red Sox rallied to beat New York.\n\nBoston won for the 13th time in 15 games to extend its lead in the AL East to five games over the second-place Yankees.

Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4). Mookie Betts had a sacrifice fly and Andrew Benintendi an RBI single. After Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again, Moreland's single made it 7-6. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a two-run single in the eighth.\n\nDODGERS 8, TIGERS 5\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Chris Taylor was 4 for 5 with two doubles, and the Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed back Adrian Gonzalez from the disabled list with a victory over Detroit.\n\nGonzalez doubled in his first plate appearance since June 11, one of six two-base hits on the night for Los Angeles. The Dodgers (86-34) have won 20 of their last 23 games and are 51-9 over their last 60.\n\nRich Hill (9-4) labored through five innings, allowing three runs and six hits, but the Dodgers gave him plenty of support. Corey Seager drove in three runs, and Logan Forsythe scored three times.\n\nJustin Upton homered twice and Victor Martinez also went deep for the Tigers, but Jordan Zimmermann (7-10) allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nGonzalez was activated before the game after being out with a herniated lumbar disk.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 37 consecutive games in which they've scored four or more runs.\n\nCUBS 7, BLUE JAYS 4\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Jake Arrieta pitched into the seventh inning and allowed a run, and Javier Baez homered and drove in three runs to help Chicago beat Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings to win his third straight start.

Happ (6-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in five innings. Miguel Montero, who began the season with the Cubs, went 2 for 4 with a run scored against his former team.\n\nCARDINALS 11, PIRATES 10\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Matt Carpenter hit a three-run homer in the second inning to make it 5-1 and St. Louis went on to outscore Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals, whose lead reached 11-3 in the eighth inning, have taken the first two games of a four-game series against the Pirates to remain 1 1/2 games behind the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs.\n\nSt. Louis has won 10 of its past 13 games despite losing three straight from Aug. 13-16. It has scored at least eight runs in eight of those 10 wins.\n\nTommy Pham homered in the first inning to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead and Paul DeJong made it 6-2 with a solo shot in the third. St. Louis scored two runs in the fourth inning to take an 8-2 lead and chase Pirates starter Trevor Williams (5-6).

He had his second straight solid outing after allowing one run in 6 2/3 innings Sunday at Texas.\n\nThe 2015 AL Cy Young winner retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, with the lone hit being a bunt single by Matt Joyce down the third-base line and away from the shift in the third inning. Of the 21 outs Keuchel recorded, 16 came on ground balls.\n\nBregman and Altuve hit back-to-back home runs in the third to give Houston a 2-0 lead. Bregman hit his 14th of the season to right field, and Altuve hit his 19th into the Crawford Boxes in left.\n\nKen Giles recorded the final five outs for his 24th save.\n\nJoyce, who was also walked by Keuchel, hit a solo home run in the eighth off Chris Devenski.\n\nSean Manaea (8-8) lost his third straight.\n\nROCKIES 8, BREWERS 4\n\nDENVER (AP) - Charlie Blackmon hit his sixth leadoff home run of the season, German Marquez won for the first time in three weeks and Colorado beat Milwaukee.\n\nGerardo Parra and Carlos Gonzalez also homered and each drove in two runs, and Nolan Arenado had a two-run triple for the Rockies. They are a game ahead of Arizona for the top NL wild card.\n\nMarquez (10-5) allowed four runs - including three solo shots - in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies took the lead with a three-run third. Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple and Parra followed with a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead 4-2.

Buxton finished a single shy of the cycle.\n\nDavid Peralta had three hits for Arizona, including a home run.\n\nWith Minnesota leading 4-3 in the seventh, Sano hit the first pitch from reliever David Hernandez 452 feet into the second deck in left-center for two runs. Escobar added a two-run shot two batters later.\n\nSano hit one even further, 474 feet into the third deck, in the eighth for his first multi-homer game this season and third of his career.\n\nBuxton hit a ball high off the wall in right-center in the fourth that rolled toward center field. As A.J. Pollock gave chase, Buxton circled the bases in 13.85 seconds, the fastest ever tracked by MLB Statcast, narrowly beating the throw by sliding headfirst across home plate.\n\nMinnesota also hit six home runs May 2 against Oakland.\n\nArizona starter Zack Godley (5-6) tied a career high by striking out 10, but allowed four earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. Twins starter Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits in six innings. All the runs came in the first two innings.\n\nNATIONALS 7, PADRES 1\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) - Matt Grace pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings in place of injured Max Scherzer, and Howie Kendrick hit a leadoff homer and drove in two runs to help Washington beat San Diego.\n\nScherzer was scratched from his scheduled start and placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sore neck. Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one. He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and manager Dusty Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nShawn Kelley came on and with one out allowed Dusty Coleman's solo homer into the second deck in left field, his fourth. Joe Blanton (2-2) pitched a scoreless sixth for the win.\n\nKendrick homered to left on the third pitch from Luis Perdomo (6-8), his sixth leadoff shot this season and seventh homer overall.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 1\n\nST.

(AP) - Corey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle, and Jay Bruce homered twice to help Cleveland rout Kansas City.\n\nKluber (12-3) was cruising along until there was one out in the sixth inning, and Eric Hosmer sent a grounder to the right side of the infield. Kluber winced coming off the mound to cover the bag.\n\nThe two-time All-Star faced one more batter before Andrew Miller relieved him. Kluber allowed a homer to Brandon Moss along with five more hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nJason Kipnis and Bruce took Ian Kennedy (4-9) deep in the first inning, and Bruce added a three-run shot in the seventh to finish with five RBIs.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion hit the Indians' fourth homer of the night leading off the ninth.\n\nWHITE SOX 4, RANGERS 3\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Nicky Delmonico lined an inside-the-park home run in the eighth inning, his second go-ahead homer of the game, and Chicago beat Texas to end a five-game losing streak.\n\nDelmonico's fifth homer eluded a leaping Nomar Mazara, bouncing off the wall as the right fielder crumpled on the warning track clutching his left knee. Second baseman Rougned Odor sprinted to retrieve the long carom, but Delmonico beat the throw with a head-first slide.\n\nA day after the end of the rookie's club-record streak of reaching base the first 13 games of his career, Delmonico drilled a two-run shot over the wall in right for a 3-2 lead in the sixth.\n\nMike Napoli's 25th homer put Texas ahead 2-1 in the fourth.\n\nGregory Infante (1-1) retired all five batters he faced for his first big league win, and Juan Minaya pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his first save in his first chance in the majors.\n\nRicky Rodriguez (0-1) was greeted by Delmonico's inside-the-park homer in his third big league appearance.\n\nREDS 5, BRAVES 3\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Cincinnati hit three home runs in the sixth, including a two-run shot by Adam Duvall, Sal Romano threw seven strong innings and the Reds beat R.A. Dickey and Atlanta.\n\nMatt Adams' homer in the second inning gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead that Dickey held until the four-run sixth. Duvall's homer drove in Joey Votto, who hit a leadoff single, to give the Reds the lead.\n\nEugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker added back-to-back homers with one out for Cincinnati's first three-homer inning of the season.\n\nRomano (3-5) snapped a streak of three straight losses in August. The rookie right-hander was dominant after giving up a second-inning homer to Adams. He allowed one run and five hits in his longest of nine starts in the majors. Rasiel Iglesias pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.\n\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwback uniforms to launch their Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend. The 83-year-old Aaron and wife Billye took an open-convertible ride around the field in a pregame ceremony.\n\nGIANTS 10, PHILLIES 2\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Matt Moore took a one-hitter into the eighth inning and picked up his first win in nearly two months, leading San Francisco past Philadelphia.\n\nHunter Pence and Brandon Crawford homered, Pablo Sandoval had an RBI single and Denard Span added three hits and made a nice running catch in center field to help San Francisco to its ninth win in the last 12 games at AT&T Park.\n\nOne day after becoming the first team in major league history to reach 11,000 wins as a franchise, the Giants added on by beating the worst team in baseball again.\n\nMoore (4-12) was crisp in his second straight strong start despite four walks, allowing two hits over 7 1/3 innings to win for the first time since June 20. Four relievers combined for five outs to complete the four-hitter. Zach Elfin (1-5) allowed six runs on seven hits over five innings for Philadelphia.\n\nMARLINS 3, METS 1\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - J.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer and Miami Marlins won for the sixth time in seven games, downing New York to move within two games of .500 for the first time since May 3.\n\nRealmuto followed Marcell Ozuna's second-inning walk with his 14th home run, lining a hanging curveball into the left-field seats for a 2-0 lead.\n\nPitching in front of a sparse crowd in a game that started almost two hours late due to steady rain and the occasional burst of lightning, Justin Nicolino (2-1) scattered six singles and stranded runners in four of his five innings. Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball:

After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards, five by each team.\n\nPujols' two-run drive was 609th, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the career. Pujols and Sosa now share the distinction of hitting more home runs that any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game. Darren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nRED SOX 9, YANKEES 6\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a two-run single in Boston's four-run seventh inning and the Red Sox rallied to beat New York.\n\nBoston won for the 13th time in 15 games to extend its lead in the AL East to five games over the second-place Yankees. New York had won four straight.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4). Mookie Betts had a sacrifice fly and Andrew Benintendi an RBI single. After Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again, Moreland's single made it 7-6. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a two-run single in the eighth.\n\nDODGERS 8, TIGERS 5\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Chris Taylor was 4 for 5 with two doubles, and the Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed back Adrian Gonzalez from the disabled list with a victory over Detroit.\n\nGonzalez doubled in his first plate appearance since June 11, one of six two-base hits on the night for Los Angeles. The Dodgers (86-34) have won 20 of their last 23 games and are 51-9 over their last 60.\n\nRich Hill (9-4) labored through five innings, allowing three runs and six hits, but the Dodgers gave him plenty of support. Corey Seager drove in three runs, and Logan Forsythe scored three times.\n\nJustin Upton homered twice and Victor Martinez also went deep for the Tigers, but Jordan Zimmermann (7-10) allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nGonzalez was activated before the game after being out with a herniated lumbar disk.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 37 consecutive games in which they've scored four or more runs.\n\nCUBS 7, BLUE JAYS 4\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Jake Arrieta pitched into the seventh inning and allowed a run, and Javier Baez homered and drove in three runs to help Chicago beat Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings to win his third straight start. Wade Davis got the final three outs for his 25th save.\n\nAnthony Rizzo went 2 for 4 with two RBIs, Victor Caratini went 3 for 3, and Jason Heyward and Albert Almora Jr. each had an RBI single for Chicago.\n\nBlue Jays starter J.A. Happ (6-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in five innings. Miguel Montero, who began the season with the Cubs, went 2 for 4 with a run scored against his former team.\n\nCARDINALS 11, PIRATES 10\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Matt Carpenter hit a three-run homer in the second inning to make it 5-1 and St. Louis went on to outscore Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals, whose lead reached 11-3 in the eighth inning, have taken the first two games of a four-game series against the Pirates to remain 1 1/2 games behind the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs.\n\nSt. Louis has won 10 of its past 13 games despite losing three straight from Aug. 13-16. It has scored at least eight runs in eight of those 10 wins.\n\nTommy Pham homered in the first inning to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead and Paul DeJong made it 6-2 with a solo shot in the third. St. Louis scored two runs in the fourth inning to take an 8-2 lead and chase Pirates starter Trevor Williams (5-6).

Right-hander Seung Hwan Oh picked up his 19th save.\n\nASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 1\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Dallas Keuchel threw seven shutout innings, Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve homered and Houston beat Oakland.\n\nKeuchel (11-2) allowed three hits, walked one and struck out three. He had his second straight solid outing after allowing one run in 6 2/3 innings Sunday at Texas.\n\nThe 2015 AL Cy Young winner retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, with the lone hit being a bunt single by Matt Joyce down the third-base line and away from the shift in the third inning. Of the 21 outs Keuchel recorded, 16 came on ground balls.\n\nBregman and Altuve hit back-to-back home runs in the third to give Houston a 2-0 lead. Bregman hit his 14th of the season to right field, and Altuve hit his 19th into the Crawford Boxes in left.\n\nKen Giles recorded the final five outs for his 24th save.\n\nJoyce, who was also walked by Keuchel, hit a solo home run in the eighth off Chris Devenski.\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Charlie Blackmon hit his sixth leadoff home run of the season, German Marquez won for the first time in three weeks and Colorado beat Milwaukee.\n\nGerardo Parra and Carlos Gonzalez also homered and each drove in two runs, and Nolan Arenado had a two-run triple for the Rockies. They are a game ahead of Arizona for the top NL wild card.\n\nMarquez (10-5) allowed four runs -- including three solo shots -- in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies took the lead with a three-run third. Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple and Parra followed with a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead 4-2. Parra added a solo homer and Gonzalez's two-run shot a batter later chased Brewers starter Matt Garza (6-7) in the fifth.\n\nTWINS 10, DIAMONDBACKS 3\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Miguel Sano hit two of the Twins' season high-tying six home runs, including an inside-the-park dash by Byron Buxton, and Minnesota powered past Arizona.\n\nEduardo Escobar, Max Kepler and Brian Dozier also went deep for Minnesota. Buxton finished a single shy of the cycle.\n\nDavid Peralta had three hits for Arizona, including a home run.\n\nWith Minnesota leading 4-3 in the seventh, Sano hit the first pitch from reliever David Hernandez 452 feet into the second deck in left-center for two runs. Escobar added a two-run shot two batters later.\n\nSano hit one even further, 474 feet into the third deck, in the eighth for his first multi-homer game this season and third of his career.\n\nBuxton hit a ball high off the wall in right-center in the fourth that rolled toward center field. As A.J. Pollock gave chase, Buxton circled the bases in 13.85 seconds, the fastest ever tracked by MLB Statcast, narrowly beating the throw by sliding headfirst across home plate.\n\nMinnesota also hit six home runs May 2 against Oakland.\n\nArizona starter Zack Godley (5-6) tied a career high by striking out 10, but allowed four earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. Twins starter Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits in six innings. All the runs came in the first two innings.\n\nNATIONALS 7, PADRES 1\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) -- Matt Grace pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings in place of injured Max Scherzer, and Howie Kendrick hit a leadoff homer and drove in two runs to help Washington beat San Diego.\n\nScherzer was scratched from his scheduled start and placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sore neck. Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one. He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and manager Dusty Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nShawn Kelley came on and with one out allowed Dusty Coleman's solo homer into the second deck in left field, his fourth. Joe Blanton (2-2) pitched a scoreless sixth for the win.\n\nKendrick homered to left on the third pitch from Luis Perdomo (6-8), his sixth leadoff shot this season and seventh homer overall.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 1\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla.

(AP) -- Corey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle, and Jay Bruce homered twice to help Cleveland rout Kansas City.\n\nKluber (12-3) was cruising along until there was one out in the sixth inning, and Eric Hosmer sent a grounder to the right side of the infield. Kluber winced coming off the mound to cover the bag.\n\nThe two-time All-Star faced one more batter before Andrew Miller relieved him. Kluber allowed a homer to Brandon Moss along with five more hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nJason Kipnis and Bruce took Ian Kennedy (4-9) deep in the first inning, and Bruce added a three-run shot in the seventh to finish with five RBIs.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion hit the Indians' fourth homer of the night leading off the ninth.\n\nWHITE SOX 4, RANGERS 3\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Nicky Delmonico lined an inside-the-park home run in the eighth inning, his second go-ahead homer of the game, and Chicago beat Texas to end a five-game losing streak.\n\nDelmonico's fifth homer eluded a leaping Nomar Mazara, bouncing off the wall as the right fielder crumpled on the warning track clutching his left knee. Second baseman Rougned Odor sprinted to retrieve the long carom, but Delmonico beat the throw with a head-first slide.\n\nA day after the end of the rookie's club-record streak of reaching base the first 13 games of his career, Delmonico drilled a two-run shot over the wall in right for a 3-2 lead in the sixth.\n\nMike Napoli's 25th homer put Texas ahead 2-1 in the fourth.\n\nGregory Infante (1-1) retired all five batters he faced for his first big league win, and Juan Minaya pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his first save in his first chance in the majors.\n\nRicky Rodriguez (0-1) was greeted by Delmonico's inside-the-park homer in his third big league appearance.\n\nREDS 5, BRAVES 3\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Cincinnati hit three home runs in the sixth, including a two-run shot by Adam Duvall, Sal Romano threw seven strong innings and the Reds beat R.A. Dickey and Atlanta.\n\nMatt Adams' homer in the second inning gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead that Dickey held until the four-run sixth. Duvall's homer drove in Joey Votto, who hit a leadoff single, to give the Reds the lead.\n\nEugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker added back-to-back homers with one out for Cincinnati's first three-homer inning of the season.\n\nRomano (3-5) snapped a streak of three straight losses in August. The rookie right-hander was dominant after giving up a second-inning homer to Adams. He allowed one run and five hits in his longest of nine starts in the majors. Rasiel Iglesias pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.\n\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwback uniforms to launch their Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend. The 83-year-old Aaron and wife Billye took an open-convertible ride around the field in a pregame ceremony.\n\nGIANTS 10, PHILLIES 2\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Matt Moore took a one-hitter into the eighth inning and picked up his first win in nearly two months, leading San Francisco past Philadelphia.\n\nHunter Pence and Brandon Crawford homered, Pablo Sandoval had an RBI single and Denard Span added three hits and made a nice running catch in center field to help San Francisco to its ninth win in the last 12 games at AT&T Park.\n\nOne day after becoming the first team in major league history to reach 11,000 wins as a franchise, the Giants added on by beating the worst team in baseball again.\n\nMoore (4-12) was crisp in his second straight strong start despite four walks, allowing two hits over 7 1/3 innings to win for the first time since June 20. Four relievers combined for five outs to complete the four-hitter. Zach Elfin (1-5) allowed six runs on seven hits over five innings for Philadelphia.\n\nMARLINS 3, METS 1\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- J.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer and Miami Marlins won for the sixth time in seven games, downing New York to move within two games of .500 for the first time since May 3.\n\nRealmuto followed Marcell Ozuna's second-inning walk with his 14th home run, lining a hanging curveball into the left-field seats for a 2-0 lead.\n\nPitching in front of a sparse crowd in a game that started almost two hours late due to steady rain and the occasional burst of lightning, Justin Nicolino (2-1) scattered six singles and stranded runners in four of his five innings. Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.", "dateTime":

After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards, five by each team.\n\nPujols' two-run drive was 609th, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the career. Pujols and Sosa now share the distinction of hitting more home runs that any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game. Darren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nRED SOX 9, YANKEES 6\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a two-run single in Boston's four-run seventh inning and the Red Sox rallied to beat New York.\n\nBoston won for the 13th time in 15 games to extend its lead in the AL East to five games over the second-place Yankees.

Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4). Mookie Betts had a sacrifice fly and Andrew Benintendi an RBI single. After Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again, Moreland's single made it 7-6. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a two-run single in the eighth.\n\nDODGERS 8, TIGERS 5\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Chris Taylor was 4 for 5 with two doubles, and the Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed back Adrian Gonzalez from the disabled list with a victory over Detroit.\n\nGonzalez doubled in his first plate appearance since June 11, one of six two-base hits on the night for Los Angeles. The Dodgers (86-34) have won 20 of their last 23 games and are 51-9 over their last 60.\n\nRich Hill (9-4) labored through five innings, allowing three runs and six hits, but the Dodgers gave him plenty of support. Corey Seager drove in three runs, and Logan Forsythe scored three times.\n\nJustin Upton homered twice and Victor Martinez also went deep for the Tigers, but Jordan Zimmermann (7-10) allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nGonzalez was activated before the game after being out with a herniated lumbar disk.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 37 consecutive games in which they've scored four or more runs.\n\nCUBS 7, BLUE JAYS 4\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Jake Arrieta pitched into the seventh inning and allowed a run, and Javier Baez homered and drove in three runs to help Chicago beat Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings to win his third straight start.

Happ (6-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in five innings. Miguel Montero, who began the season with the Cubs, went 2 for 4 with a run scored against his former team.\n\nCARDINALS 11, PIRATES 10\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Matt Carpenter hit a three-run homer in the second inning to make it 5-1 and St. Louis went on to outscore Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals, whose lead reached 11-3 in the eighth inning, have taken the first two games of a four-game series against the Pirates to remain 1 1/2 games behind the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs.\n\nSt. Louis has won 10 of its past 13 games despite losing three straight from Aug. 13-16. It has scored at least eight runs in eight of those 10 wins.\n\nTommy Pham homered in the first inning to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead and Paul DeJong made it 6-2 with a solo shot in the third. St. Louis scored two runs in the fourth inning to take an 8-2 lead and chase Pirates starter Trevor Williams (5-6).

He had his second straight solid outing after allowing one run in 6 2/3 innings Sunday at Texas.\n\nThe 2015 AL Cy Young winner retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, with the lone hit being a bunt single by Matt Joyce down the third-base line and away from the shift in the third inning. Of the 21 outs Keuchel recorded, 16 came on ground balls.\n\nBregman and Altuve hit back-to-back home runs in the third to give Houston a 2-0 lead.

They are a game ahead of Arizona for the top NL wild card.\n\nMarquez (10-5) allowed four runs -- including three solo shots -- in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies took the lead with a three-run third. Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple and Parra followed with a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead 4-2.

Buxton finished a single shy of the cycle.\n\nDavid Peralta had three hits for Arizona, including a home run.\n\nWith Minnesota leading 4-3 in the seventh, Sano hit the first pitch from reliever David Hernandez 452 feet into the second deck in left-center for two runs. Escobar added a two-run shot two batters later.\n\nSano hit one even further, 474 feet into the third deck, in the eighth for his first multi-homer game this season and third of his career.\n\nBuxton hit a ball high off the wall in right-center in the fourth that rolled toward center field. As A.J. Pollock gave chase, Buxton circled the bases in 13.85 seconds, the fastest ever tracked by MLB Statcast, narrowly beating the throw by sliding headfirst across home plate.\n\nMinnesota also hit six home runs May 2 against Oakland.\n\nArizona starter Zack Godley (5-6) tied a career high by striking out 10, but allowed four earned runs in 5 1-3 innings. Twins starter Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits in six innings. All the runs came in the first two innings.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 1\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Nelson Cruz hit his 30th homer and doubled twice, and Erasmo Ramirez won his first game for Seattle since April 1, 2014, lead the Mariners past Tampa Bay.\n\nCruz's home run was measured by MLB Statcast at 482 feet, the longest in Tropicana Field history.\n\nRamirez (5-4), who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings in the first game of the Mariners' 12-game trip.\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt (6-4).\n\nINDIANS 10, ROYALS 1\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Corey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle, and Jay Bruce homered twice to help Cleveland rout Kansas City.\n\nKluber (12-3) was cruising along until there was one out in the sixth inning, and Eric Hosmer sent a grounder to the right side of the infield.

Kluber allowed a homer to Brandon Moss along with five more hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nJason Kipnis and Bruce took Ian Kennedy (4-9) deep in the first inning, and Bruce added a three-run shot in the seventh to finish with five RBIs.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion hit the Indians' fourth homer of the night leading off the ninth.\n\nWHITE SOX 4, RANGERS 3\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Nicky Delmonico lined an inside-the-park home run in the eighth inning, his second go-ahead homer of the game, and Chicago beat Texas to end a five-game losing streak.\n\nDelmonico's fifth homer eluded a leaping Nomar Mazara, bouncing off the wall as the right fielder crumpled on the warning track clutching his left knee. Second baseman Rougned Odor sprinted to retrieve the long carom, but Delmonico beat the throw with a head-first slide.\n\nA day after the end of the rookie's club-record streak of reaching base the first 13 games of his career, Delmonico drilled a two-run shot over the wall in right for a 3-2 lead in the sixth.\n\nMike Napoli's 25th homer put Texas ahead 2-1 in the fourth.\n\nGregory Infante (1-1) retired all five batters he faced for his first big league win, and Juan Minaya pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his first save in his first chance in the majors.\n\nRicky Rodriguez (0-1) was greeted by Delmonico's inside-the-park homer in his third big league appearance.\n\nREDS 5, BRAVES 3\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Cincinnati hit three home runs in the sixth, including a two-run shot by Adam Duvall, Sal Romano threw seven strong innings and the Reds beat R.A. Dickey and Atlanta.\n\nMatt Adams' homer in the second inning gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead that Dickey held until the four-run sixth. Duvall's homer drove in Joey Votto, who hit a leadoff single, to give the Reds the lead.\n\nEugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker added back-to-back homers with one out for Cincinnati's first three-homer inning of the season.\n\nRomano (3-5) snapped a streak of three straight losses in August. The rookie right-hander was dominant after giving up a second-inning homer to Adams. He allowed one run and five hits in his longest of nine starts in the majors. Rasiel Iglesias pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.\n\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwback uniforms to launch their Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend. The 83-year-old Aaron and wife Billye took an open-convertible ride around the field in a pregame ceremony.\n\nMARLINS 3, METS 1\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- J.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer and Miami Marlins won for the sixth time in seven games, downing New York to move within two games of .500 for the first time since May 3.\n\nRealmuto followed Marcell Ozuna's second-inning walk with his 14th home run, lining a hanging curveball into the left-field seats for a 2-0 lead.\n\nPitching in front of a sparse crowd in a game that started almost two hours late due to steady rain and the occasional burst of lightning, Justin Nicolino (2-1) scattered six singles and stranded runners in four of his five innings. Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP

Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple and Parra followed with a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead 4-2.

As A.J. Pollock gave chase, Buxton circled the bases in 13.85 seconds, the fastest ever tracked by MLB Statcast, narrowly beating the throw by sliding headfirst across home plate.\n\nMinnesota also hit six home runs May 2 against Oakland.\n\nArizona starter Zack Godley (5-6) tied a career high by striking out 10, but allowed four earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. Twins starter Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits in six innings. All the runs came in the first two innings.\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) -- Matt Grace pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings in place of injured Max Scherzer, and Howie Kendrick hit a leadoff homer and drove in two runs to help Washington beat San Diego.\n\nScherzer was scratched from his scheduled start and placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sore neck. Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one. He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and manager Dusty Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nShawn Kelley came on and with one out allowed Dusty Coleman's solo homer into the second deck in left field, his fourth.

(AP) -- Corey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle, and Jay Bruce homered twice to help Cleveland rout Kansas City.\n\nKluber (12-3) was cruising along until there was one out in the sixth inning, and Eric Hosmer sent a grounder to the right side of the infield. Kluber winced coming off the mound to cover the bag.\n\nThe two-time All-Star faced one more batter before Andrew Miller relieved him. Kluber allowed a homer to Brandon Moss along with five more hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nJason Kipnis and Bruce took Ian Kennedy (4-9) deep in the first inning, and Bruce added a three-run shot in the seventh to finish with five RBIs.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion hit the Indians' fourth homer of the night leading off the ninth.\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Cincinnati hit three home runs in the sixth, including a two-run shot by Adam Duvall, Sal Romano threw seven strong innings and the Reds beat R.A. Dickey and Atlanta.\n\nMatt Adams' homer in the second inning gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead that Dickey held until the four-run sixth. Duvall's homer drove in Joey Votto, who hit a leadoff single, to give the Reds the lead.\n\nEugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker added back-to-back homers with one out for Cincinnati's first three-homer inning of the season.\n\nRomano (3-5) snapped a streak of three straight losses in August.

Rasiel Iglesias pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.\n\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwback uniforms to launch their Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend.

Four relievers combined for five outs to complete the four-hitter. Zach Elfin (1-5) allowed six runs on seven hits over five innings for Philadelphia.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- J.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer and Miami Marlins won for the sixth time in seven games, downing New York to move within two games of .500 for the first time since May 3.\n\nRealmuto followed Marcell Ozuna's second-inning walk with his 14th home run, lining a hanging curveball into the left-field seats for a 2-0 lead.\n\nPitching in front of a sparse crowd in a game that started almost two hours late due to steady rain and the occasional burst of lightning, Justin Nicolino (2-1) scattered six singles and stranded runners in four of his five innings. Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.", "dateTime":

Brad Ziegler threw a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and four walks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Dickey on the way to a victory.\n\nAdam Duvall, Eugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker hit homers off the 42-year-old Dickey in the sixth.\n\nThe only run off Romano (3-5), who went seven innings for the first time, came on a second-inning homer by Matt Adams.

He recorded three strikeouts while tossing 100 pitches, 67 for strikes.\n\nAlex Bregman and Jose Altuve slugged back-to-back home runs off Athletics left-hander Sean Manaea (8-8) in the third inning to provide Keuchel a bit of a cushion.\n\nOrioles 9, Angels 7\n\nManny Machado hit a grand slam off Keynan Middleton with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Baltimore Orioles a come-from-behind 9-7 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Orioles (60-62) and Angels (62-60) both hit five homers in the game, but Machado's blast in the ninth was the biggest.\n\nMiddleton (4-1) left a pitch where Machado could get it and he sent a shot over the fence in center.\n\nMachado also hit a solo homer and a two-run homer and finished with seven RBIs.\n\nDarren O'Day (2-3) picked up the victory for Baltimore.\n\nMike Trout and Albert Pujols each hit two-run homers for the Angels.\n\nIndians 10, Royals 1\n\nJay Bruce homered twice and drove in five runs as the Cleveland Indians battered the Kansas City Royals.\n\nIt could, however, be a costly victory for the Indians as Corey Kluber pulled up lame while running to cover first base on Eric Hosmer's sixth-inning infield single.\n\nKluber was diagnosed with a right ankle sprain.\n\nBruce hit a two-run homer in a three-run first inning off Ian Kennedy and a three-run blast in the seventh inning off rookie Jake Junis.\n\nTwins 10, Diamondbacks 3\n\nByron Buxton hit an inside-the-park home run and was a single away from a cycle while Miguel Sano went deep twice and the Minnesota Twins tied a season high with six home runs in a 10-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nSano and Eduardo Escobar each hit two-run shots in the seventh inning.\n\nMax Kepler and Brian Dozier added solo homers while Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three runs on seven hits and three walks.\n\nMitch Moreland capped a wild seventh inning with a pinch-hit two-run single and the Boston Red Sox pulled out a 9-6 victory over the New York Yankees.\n\nRed Sox starter Drew Pomeranz left the game in the fourth inning with back spasms and the Boston bullpen imploded to the tune of two runs allowed in the sixth and four more in the seventh.\n\nRonald Torreyes smacked a long two-run single and Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch to give the Yankees a 6-3 lead in the top of the seventh.\n\nWhite Sox 4, Rangers 3\n\nChicago rookie Nicky Delmonico's torrid major-league start continued as he homered twice and lifted the White Sox to a 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers.\n\nDelmonico hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and then broke a 3-3 tie with an inside-the-park homer in the eighth.\n\nThe win ended a five-game losing streak for the White Sox and snapped a four-game winning streak for the Rangers.\n\nRockies 8, Brewers 4\n\nThe Colorado Rockies pounded Milwaukee starter Matt Garza on Friday night and beat the Brewers 8-4.\n\nGarza gave up three homers among the nine hits he allowed and eight runs (seven earned) in 4-1/3 innings.\n\nCharlie Blackmon hit his sixth leadoff homer and the 28th of his career. Gerardo Parra hit his 10th homer in the fifth, and two batters later Carlos Gonzalez hit a two-run homer that gave the Rockies an 8-2 lead and finished Garza's game.\n\nGarza (6-7) is 2-6 with a 6.90 ERA in eight starts against the Rockies and is 0-4 with a 10.02 ERA in four starts at Coors Field.\n\nMarlins 3, Mets 1\n\nJ.T.

Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers.\n\nGiants 10, Phillies 2\n\nHunter Pence and Brandon Crawford provided early offense with home runs and left-hander Matt Moore took a shutout into the eighth inning, leading the San Francisco Giants to a 10-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nJarrett Parker highlighted a three-run first inning with a two-RBI double, giving the Giants a lead they never relinquished.\n\nStaked to a 6-0 lead by the end of the third, Moore coasted through seven innings, allowing only one hit.\n\nFreddy Galvis had a two-run single for the Phillies.\n\nNationals 7, Padres 1\n\nHowie Kendrick homered and last-minute starter Matt Grace threw 4-1/3 scoreless innings as Washington beat San Diego.\n\nKendrick christened the game with his seventh homer of his season, giving Washington a lead it never relinquished.\n\nGrace was a late replacement for injured Matt Scherzer. The Nationals ace was waylaid by a sore neck and was placed on the disabled list before the game.\n\nCubs 7, Blue Jays 4\n\nJake Arrieta allowed a first-inning run and two hits and then scattered four hits the rest of the way to lead Chicago to an inter-league victory over Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) worked 6-1/3 innings en route to his third straight win and seventh consecutive quality start as the Cubs maintained their perch atop the NL Central Division.\n\nToronto starter J.A.

Dickey on the way to a victory.\n\nAdam Duvall, Eugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker hit homers off the 42-year-old Dickey in the sixth.\n\nThe only run off Romano (3-5), who went seven innings for the first time, came on a second-inning homer by Matt Adams. The 23-year-old right-hander allowed five hits and two walks while striking out three.\n\nMariners 7, Rays 1\n\nNelson Cruz crushed his 30th home run of the season in the ninth -- at 482 feet, the longest recorded at Tropicana Field -- as the Mariners beat the Rays.\n\nMariners starter Erasmo Ramirez (5-4) held his former team to one run on three hits.\n\nAstros 3, A's 1\n\nDallas Keuchel worked seven shutout innings and paced the Houston Astros to a 3-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics.\n\nKeuchel (11-2) recorded a season-high 16 groundball outs while surrendering just three hits and one walk. He recorded three strikeouts while tossing 100 pitches, 67 for strikes.\n\nAlex Bregman and Jose Altuve slugged back-to-back home runs off Athletics left-hander Sean Manaea (8-8) in the third inning to provide Keuchel a bit of a cushion.\n\nOrioles 9, Angels 7\n\nManny Machado hit a grand slam off Keynan Middleton with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Baltimore Orioles a come-from-behind 9-7 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Orioles (60-62) and Angels (62-60) both hit five homers in the game, but Machado's blast in the ninth was the biggest.\n\nMiddleton (4-1) left a pitch where Machado could get it and he sent a shot over the fence in center.\n\nMachado also hit a solo homer and a two-run homer and finished with seven RBIs.\n\nDarren O'Day (2-3) picked up the victory for Baltimore.\n\nMike Trout and Albert Pujols each hit two-run homers for the Angels.\n\nIndians 10, Royals 1\n\nJay Bruce homered twice and drove in five runs as the Cleveland Indians battered the Kansas City Royals.\n\nIt could, however, be a costly victory for the Indians as Corey Kluber pulled up lame while running to cover first base on Eric Hosmer's sixth-inning infield single.\n\nKluber was diagnosed with a right ankle sprain.\n\nBruce hit a two-run homer in a three-run first inning off Ian Kennedy and a three-run blast in the seventh inning off rookie Jake Junis.\n\nTwins 10, Diamondbacks 3\n\nByron Buxton hit an inside-the-park home run and was a single away from a cycle while Miguel Sano went deep twice and the Minnesota Twins tied a season high with six home runs in a 10-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nSano and Eduardo Escobar each hit two-run shots in the seventh inning.\n\nMax Kepler and Brian Dozier added solo homers while Ervin Santana (13-7) allowed three runs on seven hits and three walks.\n\nHe struck out six.\n\nRed Sox 9, Yankees 6\n\nMitch Moreland capped a wild seventh inning with a pinch-hit two-run single and the Boston Red Sox pulled out a 9-6 victory over the New York Yankees.\n\nRed Sox starter Drew Pomeranz left the game in the fourth inning with back spasms and the Boston bullpen imploded to the tune of two runs allowed in the sixth and four more in the seventh.\n\nRonald Torreyes smacked a long two-run single and Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch to give the Yankees a 6-3 lead in the top of the seventh.\n\nWhite Sox 4, Rangers 3\n\nChicago rookie Nicky Delmonico's torrid major-league start continued as he homered twice and lifted the White Sox to a 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers.\n\nDelmonico hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and then broke a 3-3 tie with an inside-the-park homer in the eighth.\n\nThe win ended a five-game losing streak for the White Sox and snapped a four-game winning streak for the Rangers.\n\nRockies 8, Brewers 4\n\nThe Colorado Rockies pounded Milwaukee starter Matt Garza on Friday night and beat the Brewers 8-4.\n\nGarza gave up three homers among the nine hits he allowed and eight runs (seven earned) in 4-1/3 innings.\n\nCharlie Blackmon hit his sixth leadoff homer and the 28th of his career. Gerardo Parra hit his 10th homer in the fifth, and two batters later Carlos Gonzalez hit a two-run homer that gave the Rockies an 8-2 lead and finished Garza's game.\n\nGarza (6-7) is 2-6 with a 6.90 ERA in eight starts against the Rockies and is 0-4 with a 10.02 ERA in four starts at Coors Field.\n\nMarlins 3, Mets 1\n\nJ.T. Realmuto hit a two-run homer in the second inning and Justin Nicolino earned his second straight win with five solid innings as the Miami Marlins beat the New York Mets.\n\nMarcell Ozuna lofted a sacrifice fly in the third for the Marlins.\n\nMarlins right fielder Giancarlo Stanton, whose six-game home run streak was snapped on Wednesday, went 0-for-2 with a pair of walks. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers.\n\nGiants 10, Phillies 2\n\nHunter Pence and Brandon Crawford provided early offense with home runs and left-hander Matt Moore took a shutout into the eighth inning, leading the San Francisco Giants to a 10-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nJarrett Parker highlighted a three-run first inning with a two-RBI double, giving the Giants a lead they never relinquished.\n\nStaked to a 6-0 lead by the end of the third, Moore coasted through seven innings, allowing only one hit.\n\nFreddy Galvis had a two-run single for the Phillies.\n\nNationals 7, Padres 1\n\nHowie Kendrick homered and last-minute starter Matt Grace threw 4-1/3 scoreless innings as Washington beat San Diego.\n\nKendrick christened the game with his seventh homer of his season, giving Washington a lead it never relinquished.\n\nGrace was a late replacement for injured Matt Scherzer. The Nationals ace was waylaid by a sore neck and was placed on the disabled list before the game.\n\nCubs 7, Blue Jays 4\n\nJake Arrieta allowed a first-inning run and two hits and then scattered four hits the rest of the way to lead Chicago to an inter-league victory over Toronto.\n\nArrieta (13-8) worked 6-1/3 innings en route to his third straight win and seventh consecutive quality start as the Cubs maintained their perch atop the NL Central Division.\n\nToronto starter J.A. Happ (6-9) took the loss and had a three-game winning streak snapped as the Blue Jays saw a two-game winning streak come to an end.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:31:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd":

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry.\n\nDODGERS 3, TIGERS 0\n\nDETROIT -- Adrian Gonzalez's seventh-inning single broke a scoreless tie and Los Angeles went on to its sixth straight win and 21st in the last 24 games.\n\nDetroit has lost six straight and 12 of 14.\n\nDodgers right fielder Cody Bellinger left the game in the seventh inning. He rolled his right ankle in the sixth while catching a fly ball from Nicholas Castellanos. Yasiel Puig hit for him the next inning. Bellinger is listed as day-to-day.\n\nHyun-Jin Ryu pitched five innings, allowing three hits and walking four while striking out four. He needed 89 pitches to get through five innings, and was replaced by eventual winner Ross Stripling (3-4).\n\nBrandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen finished off the shutout, with Jansen pitching the ninth for his 33rd save.\n\nTigers starter Michael Fulmer (10-11) gave up an unearned run, three hits and two walks in seven innings. He struck out six.\n\nINDIANS 5, ROYALS 0\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Trevor Bauer pitched 6 1/3 innings to get his career-best fifth straight win as Cleveland beat Kansas City.\n\nBauer (12-8) gave up seven hits, walked two and struck out four. Relievers Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen did not allow a hit over the final 2 2/3 innings to complete the shutout.\n\nBauer joins teammates Corey Kluber and Carlos Carrasco as 12-game winners. The Indians are the only team in the majors with three 12-game winners.\n\nRoberto Perez delivered the clutch blow, a two-out, two-strike, two-run single in the fourth inning that scored Jay Bruce and Carlos Santana.\n\nJose Ramirez and Jason Kipnis hit consecutive doubles in the first inning for the first Cleveland run.\n\nCUBS 4, BLUE JAYS 3\n\nCHICAGO -- Rookie Ian Happ hit his 18th home run, Jose Quintana pitched six effective innings and Chicago kept up its success against AL opponents.\n\nThe World Series champions have won nine of their last 10 interleague games. The NL Central leaders have won five of seven overall.\n\nHapp hit an RBI single in the first inning and added a solo homer in the fourth. In the sixth, Happ drew a leadoff walk from Danny Barnes (2-4) and later scored on a two-out single by Javier Baez for the go-ahead run.\n\nIn his seventh start since being acquired in a trade from the White Sox, Quintana (4-2) gave up two runs and four hits. He struck out eight and walked two.\n\nCubs closer Wade Davis pitched a perfect ninth for his 26th save in 26 chances. He tied the franchise record for consecutive saves opportunities converted.\n\nPIRATES 6, CARDINALS 4\n\nPITTSBURGH -- Adam Frazier homered, doubled and singled as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Saturday to end a six-game losing streak.\n\nFrazier hit a two-run homer in the second and doubled off the wall the next inning. Starling Marte and pinch-hitter Jose Osuna also homered for Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals scored 11 runs in each of their two wins to start this series. Paul DeJong hit a two-run homer in the eighth and Jose Martinez homered in the ninth.\n\nChad Kuhl (6-8) responded well following a rain delay that lasted nearly two hours, giving up one run and three hits in five innings. Felipe Rivero got his 13th save.\n\nMichael Wacha (9-6) was tagged for five runs and seven hits in four innings.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 6\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Mitch Haniger hit a grand slam, Nelson Cruz added his 31st home run and Seattle rolled to its fourth straight win.\n\nHaniger's first career grand slam came in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list, lifting the Mariners to a 4-1 lead in the third inning. It was his eighth homer of the season.\n\nCruz, who is on an 11-game hitting streak, hit his seventh homer in 10 games with a man on base in the fourth, raising his league-leading RBI total to 100.\n\nBoth home runs came off Jake Odorizzi, who gave up seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. Odorizzi (6-7) lost his third straight start.\n\nSteven Souza Jr. hit his 26th homer and Lucas Duda hit his fifth for the Rays, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Logan Morrison added a pinch-hit homer in the ninth, his 29th of the season.\n\nASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 0\n\nHOUSTON -- Collin McHugh threw six innings, Marwin Gonzalez hit a two-run single and Houston beat Oakland.\n\nMcHugh (1-2) gave up six hits and struck out three. McHugh, who missed the first 3 1/2 months with right shoulder tendinitis and a right elbow injury, has allowed two runs or fewer in four of his six starts this season.\n\nAfter Jose Altuve and Josh Reddick walked and Yuli Gurriel singled to lead off the fourth, Gonzalez followed with his two-run single. Kendall Graveman (3-4) induced flyouts from Carlos Beltran, Juan Centeno and Derek Fisher to prevent further damage.\n\nAlex Bregman added a solo home run over the train tracks above the left field wall to lead off the eighth.\n\nMETS 8, MARLINS 1\n\nNEW YORK -- Rafael Montero pitched six strong innings in his best effort of the season, and Wilmer Flores and Kevin Plawecki each hit long two-run homers to help the New York Mets snap a five-game losing streak.\n\nAsdrubal Cabrera and Michael Conforto each drove in a run for the Mets, who scored seven runs in the sixth -- their season high for an inning -- after being held to just three base runners over the first five innings by Vance Worley (2-3). New York began the day with an NL-worst .221 batting average in August.\n\nAided by five double plays, Montero (2-8) kept the Marlins off-balance with a fastball-slider combination to allow a run and six hits. The right-hander walked three and struck out five.\n\nMarcell Ozuna drove in Dee Gordon for the lone Miami run.\n\nTWINS 5, DIAMONDBACKS 0\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- Jose Berrios threw seven innings for his 11th win to help Minnesota keep pace in the AL wild card race.\n\nThe Twins, who entered the night in a tie with the Los Angeles Angels for the second wild card spot, scored five runs off Diamondbacks starter Zack Greinke (14-6) in the fourth after a costly error by second baseman Daniel Descalso ended a chance for a double play. Max Kepler drove in two runs during the inning, and Brian Dozier and Joe Mauer each had an RBI single.\n\nThat was more than enough for Berrios (11-6), who allowed only two hits for the second time this month, and got some solid defensive support to win for the second time in three starts. Berrios combined with reliever Alan Busenitz to retire the last 19 Arizona batters.\n\nGreinke had won four of his previous five but ended the night with his shortest outing this season. He allowed seven hits and four walks, while striking out four.\n\nREDS 11, BRAVES 8\n\nATLANTA -- Scooter Gennett hit a grand slam to lead Cincinnati past Atlanta.\n\nJulio Teheran, expected to be the Braves' ace for a fifth straight year, set an Atlanta record by losing his ninth straight home decision. He dropped to 1-9 with a 6.98 ERA in 13 starts at SunTrust Park.\n\nGennett's 21st homer, his third grand slam this season and fourth of career, made it 11-4 in the ninth. The Braves scored four runs in the bottom half, but Michael Lorenzen, the second Cincinnati pitcher of the inning, earned his second save after Blake Wood failed to retire a batter and allowed the four runs.\n\nRobert Stephenson (1-4) gave up three hits, three walks and two runs -- one earned -- in five innings. He struck out five, but had some struggles, dropping a ball at first base, hitting a batter and throwing a bunt attempt into the Atlanta dugout.\n\nTeheran (7-11) allowed eight hits, three walks and five runs.\n\nANGELS 5, ORIOLES 1\n\nBALTIMORE -- Mike Trout and Luis Valbuena each hit two home runs off Kevin Gausman, and the Angels won for the eighth time in 10 games.\n\nTrout homered in the first and third innings, and Valbuena connected in the second and fourth to give Los Angeles a four-run lead.\n\nIt marked the second straight night in which the Angels got all their runs via the long ball. In the series opener, Los Angeles homered five times in a 9-7 defeat.\n\nTrout now has 26 home runs. He has six seasons with at least 25, tied with Tim Salmon for most in franchise history.\n\nJC Ramirez (11-10) allowed one run and five hits over 5 2/3 innings before leaving with right forearm tightness. In his last start against the Orioles, the right-hander gave up six runs in seven innings on Aug. 7.\n\nGausman (9-9) struggled through four innings, allowing five runs and six hits.", "dateTime":

There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards, five by each team.\n\nPujols' two-run drive was the 609th of his career, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the all-time list. Pujols and Sosa now share the distinction of hitting more home runs that any other foreign-born players.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used home runs by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game.\n\nDarren O'Day (4-1) got the victory with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nRED SOX 9, YANKEES 6 Pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a two-run single in Boston's four-run seventh inning and the Red Sox rallied to beat visiting New York.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 1 Nelson Cruz hit two doubles and his 30th home run and Erasmo Ramirez won his first game for Seattle since April 1, 2014, in a victory over host Tampa Bay.\n\nWHITE SOX 4, RANGERS 3 Nicky Delmonico lined an inside-the-park home run in the eighth inning, his second go-ahead home run of the game, and visiting Chicago stopped a five-game losing streak with a victory over Texas.\n\nASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 1 Former Arkansas Razorback Dallas Keuchel threw seven shutout innings, Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve homered and host Houston beat Oakland.\n\nINDIANS 10, ROYALS 1 Corey Kluber put together another Cy Young-worthy performance before leaving with a sprained right ankle and Jay Bruce homered twice to help visiting Cleveland rout Kansas City in the opener of their three-game series.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE\n\nCARDINALS 11, PIRATES 10 Matt Carpenter homered in the second inning to send St. Louis on to victory over host Pittsburgh. The Cardinals lead reached 11-3 in the eighth inning.\n\nMARLINS 3, METS 1 J.T.

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry.\n\nDODGERS 3, TIGERS 0\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Adrian Gonzalez's seventh-inning single broke a scoreless tie and Los Angeles went on to its sixth straight win and 21st in the last 24 games.\n\nDetroit has lost six straight and 12 of 14.\n\nDodgers right fielder Cody Bellinger left the game in the seventh inning. He rolled his right ankle in the sixth while catching a fly ball from Nicholas Castellanos. Yasiel Puig hit for him the next inning. Bellinger is listed as day-to-day.\n\nHyun-Jin Ryu pitched five innings, allowing three hits and walking four while striking out four. He needed 89 pitches to get through five innings, and was replaced by eventual winner Ross Stripling (3-4).\n\nBrandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen finished off the shutout, with Jansen pitching the ninth for his 33rd save.\n\nTigers starter Michael Fulmer (10-11) gave up an unearned run, three hits and two walks in seven innings. He struck out six.\n\nINDIANS 5, ROYALS 0\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Trevor Bauer pitched 6 1/3 innings to get his career-best fifth straight win as Cleveland beat Kansas City.\n\nBauer (12-8) gave up seven hits, walked two and struck out four. Relievers Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen did not allow a hit over the final 2 2/3 innings to complete the shutout.\n\nBauer joins teammates Corey Kluber and Carlos Carrasco as 12-game winners. The Indians are the only team in the majors with three 12-game winners.\n\nRoberto Perez delivered the clutch blow, a two-out, two-strike, two-run single in the fourth inning that scored Jay Bruce and Carlos Santana.\n\nJose Ramirez and Jason Kipnis hit consecutive doubles in the first inning for the first Cleveland run.\n\nCUBS 4, BLUE JAYS 3\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Rookie Ian Happ hit his 18th home run, Jose Quintana pitched six effective innings and Chicago kept up its success against AL opponents.\n\nThe World Series champions have won nine of their last 10 interleague games. The NL Central leaders have won five of seven overall.\n\nHapp hit an RBI single in the first inning and added a solo homer in the fourth. In the sixth, Happ drew a leadoff walk from Danny Barnes (2-4) and later scored on a two-out single by Javier Baez for the go-ahead run.\n\nIn his seventh start since being acquired in a trade from the White Sox, Quintana (4-2) gave up two runs and four hits. He struck out eight and walked two.\n\nCubs closer Wade Davis pitched a perfect ninth for his 26th save in 26 chances. He tied the franchise record for consecutive saves opportunities converted.\n\nPIRATES 6, CARDINALS 4\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Adam Frazier homered, doubled and singled as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Saturday to end a six-game losing streak.\n\nFrazier hit a two-run homer in the second and doubled off the wall the next inning. Starling Marte and pinch-hitter Jose Osuna also homered for Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cardinals scored 11 runs in each of their two wins to start this series. Paul DeJong hit a two-run homer in the eighth and Jose Martinez homered in the ninth.\n\nChad Kuhl (6-8) responded well following a rain delay that lasted nearly two hours, giving up one run and three hits in five innings. Felipe Rivero got his 13th save.\n\nMichael Wacha (9-6) was tagged for five runs and seven hits in four innings.\n\nMARINERS 7, RAYS 6\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Mitch Haniger hit a grand slam, Nelson Cruz added his 31st home run and Seattle rolled to its fourth straight win.\n\nHaniger's first career grand slam came in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list, lifting the Mariners to a 4-1 lead in the third inning. It was his eighth homer of the season.\n\nCruz, who is on an 11-game hitting streak, hit his seventh homer in 10 games with a man on base in the fourth, raising his league-leading RBI total to 100.\n\nBoth home runs came off Jake Odorizzi, who gave up seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. Odorizzi (6-7) lost his third straight start.\n\nSteven Souza Jr. hit his 26th homer and Lucas Duda hit his fifth for the Rays, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Logan Morrison added a pinch-hit homer in the ninth, his 29th of the season.\n\nASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 0\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Collin McHugh threw six innings, Marwin Gonzalez hit a two-run single and Houston beat Oakland.\n\nMcHugh (1-2) gave up six hits and struck out three. McHugh, who missed the first 3 1/2 months with right shoulder tendinitis and a right elbow injury, has allowed two runs or fewer in four of his six starts this season.\n\nAfter Jose Altuve and Josh Reddick walked and Yuli Gurriel singled to lead off the fourth, Gonzalez followed with his two-run single. Kendall Graveman (3-4) induced flyouts from Carlos Beltran, Juan Centeno and Derek Fisher to prevent further damage.\n\nAlex Bregman added a solo home run over the train tracks above the left field wall to lead off the eighth.\n\nMETS 8, MARLINS 1\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Rafael Montero pitched six strong innings in his best effort of the season, and Wilmer Flores and Kevin Plawecki each hit long two-run homers to help the New York Mets snap a five-game losing streak.\n\nAsdrubal Cabrera and Michael Conforto each drove in a run for the Mets, who scored seven runs in the sixth -- their season high for an inning -- after being held to just three base runners over the first five innings by Vance Worley (2-3). New York began the day with an NL-worst .221 batting average in August.\n\nAided by five double plays, Montero (2-8) kept the Marlins off-balance with a fastball-slider combination to allow a run and six hits. The right-hander walked three and struck out five.\n\nMarcell Ozuna drove in Dee Gordon for the lone Miami run.\n\nTWINS 5, DIAMONDBACKS 0\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Jose Berrios threw seven innings for his 11th win to help Minnesota keep pace in the AL wild card race.\n\nThe Twins, who entered the night in a tie with the Los Angeles Angels for the second wild card spot, scored five runs off Diamondbacks starter Zack Greinke (14-6) in the fourth after a costly error by second baseman Daniel Descalso ended a chance for a double play. Max Kepler drove in two runs during the inning, and Brian Dozier and Joe Mauer each had an RBI single.\n\nThat was more than enough for Berrios (11-6), who allowed only two hits for the second time this month, and got some solid defensive support to win for the second time in three starts. Berrios combined with reliever Alan Busenitz to retire the last 19 Arizona batters.\n\nGreinke had won four of his previous five but ended the night with his shortest outing this season. He allowed seven hits and four walks, while striking out four.\n\nREDS 11, BRAVES 8\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Scooter Gennett hit a grand slam to lead Cincinnati past Atlanta.\n\nJulio Teheran, expected to be the Braves' ace for a fifth straight year, set an Atlanta record by losing his ninth straight home decision. He dropped to 1-9 with a 6.98 ERA in 13 starts at SunTrust Park.\n\nGennett's 21st homer, his third grand slam this season and fourth of career, made it 11-4 in the ninth. The Braves scored four runs in the bottom half, but Michael Lorenzen, the second Cincinnati pitcher of the inning, earned his second save after Blake Wood failed to retire a batter and allowed the four runs.\n\nRobert Stephenson (1-4) gave up three hits, three walks and two runs -- one earned -- in five innings. He struck out five, but had some struggles, dropping a ball at first base, hitting a batter and throwing a bunt attempt into the Atlanta dugout.\n\nTeheran (7-11) allowed eight hits, three walks and five runs.\n\nANGELS 5, ORIOLES 1\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Trout and Luis Valbuena each hit two home runs off Kevin Gausman, and the Angels won for the eighth time in 10 games.\n\nTrout homered in the first and third innings, and Valbuena connected in the second and fourth to give Los Angeles a four-run lead.\n\nIt marked the second straight night in which the Angels got all their runs via the long ball. In the series opener, Los Angeles homered five times in a 9-7 defeat.\n\nTrout now has 26 home runs. He has six seasons with at least 25, tied with Tim Salmon for most in franchise history.\n\nJC Ramirez (11-10) allowed one run and five hits over 5 2/3 innings before leaving with right forearm tightness. In his last start against the Orioles, the right-hander gave up six runs in seven innings on Aug. 7.\n\nGausman (9-9) struggled through four innings, allowing five runs and six hits.", "dateTime":

He gave up two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and ended Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had given up three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe score was 4-3 in the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three consecutive knuckle curves.\n\nSeattle 7, Tampa Bay 6: Mitch Haniger hit a grand slam, Nelson Cruz added his 31st homer and the Mariners rolled to their fourth consecutive victory, beating the host Rays. Haniger's first career grand slam came in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list. He was hit in the face by a pitch on July 29.\n\nLos Angeles 5, Baltimore 1: Mike Trout and Luis Valbuena each hit two home runs off Kevin Gausman, and the Angels beat the host Orioles for their eighth victory in 10 games. Baltimore has lost seven of 11.\n\nCleveland 5, Kansas City 0: Trevor Bauer pitched 6\u2153 innings to win his career-best fifth consecutive decision, and the Indians beat the host Royals, who are 6-12 in August. Kansas City starters have a 5.99 ERA for the month.\n\nHouston 3, Oakland 0: Collin McHugh threw six innings, Marwin Gonzalez hit a two-run single and the host Astros improved to 12-2 vs. the Athletics this year.\n\nNational League\n\nPittsburgh 6, St. Louis 4: Adam Frazier homered, doubled and singled to help the host Pirates beat the Cardinals, ending a six-game losing streak in a game delayed nearly two hours by rain.\n\nCincinnati 11, Atlanta 8: Scooter Gennett hit a grand slam and the Reds beat struggling Julio Teheran and the host Braves. Teheran dropped to 1-9 with a 6.98 ERA in 13 starts at home.\n\nNew York 8, Miami 1: Rafael Montero pitched six innings, and Wilmer Flores and Kevin Plawecki each hit long two-run homers to help the host Mets end a five-game losing streak.\n\nMilwaukee 6, Colorado 3: Jesus Aguilar hit a tiebreaking, pinch-hit, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Greg Holland, and the Brewers beat the host Rockies.\n\nSan Diego 3, Washington 1: Travis Wood outpitched Stephen Strasburg by going seven strong innings for the host Padres. The Nationals activated Strasburg off the disabled list.\n\nInterleague\n\nChicago Cubs 4, Toronto 3: Rookie Ian Happ hit his 18th home run, Jose Quintana pitched six effective innings and the host Cubs beat the Blue Jays to keep up their success against AL opponents. The World Series champions have won nine of their past 10 interleague games.\n\nL.A. Dodgers 3, Detroit 0: Adrian Gonzalez's seventh-inning single broke a scoreless tie and the visiting Dodgers went on to their 52nd victory in 61 games.The Tigers have lost six in a row and 12 of 14.\n\nEtc.\n\n*The Dodgers placed righthander Yu Darvish (back tightness) on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Aug. 17.

Prison.\n\nIn a statement cited by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa, the head of the official Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs Commission, Qadura Fares, urged the international community to \"urgently intervene to stop the unprecedented crimes committed against Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails.\"\n\nAccording to Israel's Army Radio, 10 soldiers were detained for questioning as part of an investigation into the gang-rape of a Palestinian detainee from Gaza in the Sde Teiman Prison in southern Israel.\n\n\"The farce that the occupation military police came up with, and their detention of several soldiers aim to mislead the world public opinion,\" he said.\n\nFares affirmed that the Israeli crimes against Palestinian detainees \"no longer have any conceivable limits, and they constitute a facet on the ongoing genocide.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Hamas group also urged for an international probe to look into the Israeli violations against detainees in the light of the gang-rape incident.\n\n\"We demand an international investigation committee to investigate these horrific and brutal crimes against the prisoners,\" Hamas said.\n\nIt stressed the necessity for the world, the UN, and rights groups to turn the attention \"to the (Israeli) occupation prisons and the disappeared people in them to follow up their conditions and unknown fate.\"\n\nSeveral reports

gathered outside an army event on the conscription of members of their community into the military, Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported.\n\n\"You will be killed and won't pass,\" chanted protesters as they tried to block the entrance to the building and prevent attendees from crossing.\n\nFor months, the army has faced a personnel shortage amid its ongoing war in Gaza since Oct.7, military raids in the West Bank and cross-border clashes with Lebanese group Hezbollah.\n\nLast month, Israel's Supreme Court mandated the drafting of Haredi Jews into the army and banned financial aid to religious institutions whose students refuse military service.\n\nHaredi Jews make up about 13% of Israel's population of approximately 9.9 million and do not serve in the military, dedicating their lives to studying the Torah.\n\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza since an Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.\n\nAt least 39,400 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and nearly 91,000 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver nine months into the Israeli onslaught, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which

It is being attacked by the Houthis, missiles are being fired from Hezbollah, notwithstanding the desire for Hamas to wipe Israel off the map.\"\n\n\"For those reasons, it would not be right to have a blanket ban between our country and Israel,\" Lammy reportedly added.\n\nUK Attorney General Richard Hermer KC visited Israel last week after the government lifted previous objections to an International Criminal Court (ICC) request for an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHermer has previously criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory in the West Bank, describing it as \"deeply damaging\" and \"wholly contrary to the values of tikkun olam (repairing the world) that I grew up with and continue to guide me.\"\n\nHermer, along with other prominent Jewish lawyers in the UK, called for Israeli restraint following October 7.\n\nPhilippe Sands KC, another signatory who has represented Palestinians at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), recently argued for halting UK arms sales to Israel following an ICJ opinion on ending the occupation of the West Bank.\n\nOver the past year, the UK exported \u00a318.2 million ($23.4 million) worth of arms to Israel, including components for the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, which Britain co-produces with the US.\n\nThe F-35 is believed to have been used in the Gaza war, which has resulted in over 39,000 deaths according to local officials.\n\nSeveral countries, including Canada, the Netherlands, Japan, Spain, and Belgium, have announced they will stop shipping weapons to Israel.\n\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza.\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 39,400 Palestinians have been killed, and 90,996 wounded in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 11,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nIsrael says that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation on October 7. Israeli media published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed on that day by 'friendly fire'.\n\nGAZA LIVE BLOG: Israel Attacks Southern Suburbs of Beirut (BREAKING NEWS) - Day 298\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.",

These arms sales include components for F-35 fighter jets, which are regularly employed in airstrikes.\n\nAction on Armed Violence (AOAV) data for the same period reports that Israeli airstrikes account for over 45 percent of recent fatalities in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's bombing campaign has been described as one of the deadliest and most destructive in modern history, involving the use of powerful Mark 84 2,000-pound bombs, which have a lethal fragmentation radius of up to 1,100 feet (335.28 meters).\n\nHalima Begum, chief executive of Oxfam GB, condemned the ongoing arms sales: \"Israeli fighter jets, like the F-35, are relentlessly dropping lethal bombs that indiscriminately kill and maim civilians across Gaza every single day. The humanitarian impact has been horrific. By selling F-35 components to Israel, the UK Government is effectively facilitating many of the Israeli airstrikes and the decimation of Gaza.\"\n\nBegum emphasized the legal and moral obligations of the UK: \"The government is fully aware of the risk that arms exported from the UK are likely being used to commit war crimes in Gaza.\"\n\n\"It is critical that the UK Government immediately suspend both existing and new licences for all arms sales, whether direct to Israel or via third parties. Without such concrete action, glaring loopholes for continued arms transfers will remain. Minor restrictions will make little meaningful difference in this appalling crisis,\" she added.\n\nMore than 39,360 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and nearly 91,000 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver nine months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, whose latest ruling ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.\n\nHumanitarian organization estimates that over 1,800 people, including more than 600 children, will be killed, and over

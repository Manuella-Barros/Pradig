But state business leaders said Wednesday while they support they new mandate, the state did not give employers adequate notice, or time, to prepare.\n\n\"If you're busy making pizzas or doing plumbing, you might not be aware that these things are available unless you belong to a business council or chamber of commerce,\" said Frank Kerbein, director of the Human Resources Center with the Business Council of New York State.\n\nThe state Labor Department only released updated guidance on the policy this week -- or two days before the law took effect.\n\nDiscrimination or retaliation against breastfeeding employees is prohibited, which is expected to increase litigation of businesses not complying with the law.\n\nKerbein said most New York employers are used to providing breastfeeding workers a private place to express breast milk, but added over 99% of employers across the state have fewer than 20 employees -- and while the new law is worthy, it could pose unexpected cost burdens for small businesses.\n\n\"The time spent complying with these things adds up and New York has difficulties with its reputation for being business-friendly,\" Kerbein said. \"And this is all part of it.\"\n\nState Labor Department officials did respond to questions about business leaders' criticisms that the department did not inform businesses about the mandate early enough or allow sufficient time to plan for the change. All state departments were closed Wednesday in honor of the holiday Juneteenth.\n\nThe state Department of Labor encourages New York employees who are not provided paid breaks or a private space with a chair and table near clear water to express breast milk to file a complaint with the department's Division of Labor Standards.

But New York's first \"mom governor\" Kathy Hochul just took it one step further -- and signed a law to require that moms get paid break time. For hardworking moms, this is a total game-changer!\n\nAs of Wednesday, New York employers are required to provide 30 minutes of paid break time to workers who need to express breast milk for up to three years after childbirth, per AP News. This break time cannot come from the employee's preexisting meal break or other paid break, and it applies to all public and private employers in the state. This is a huge win for moms!\n\n\"As New York's first mom Governor, I am fighting every day to give working parents the protections they need to keep their families strong and healthy,\" Governor Hochul said in a news release.\n\nAccording to the CDC, it's recommended that infants are exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their lives. Current data shows that only 25.4% of infants are exclusively breastfed through 6 months, with 58.2% of babies still receiving at least some breastmilk at six months. Despite the recommendation to breastfeed through six months, the U.S. only provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave through the Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) act. Unlike other countries, there are no paid protections for parental leave in the U.S.\n\nEven though many moms have to go back to work for financial reasons or choose to go back to work before their babies are six months old, being able to pump at work is a great way to feel close to your child and reach your breastfeeding goals. The fact that Gov. Hochul understands the needs of moms and passed this law for New York shows how important it is to have representation in our government! Hopefully this trend will continue to ease the burden of working moms.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydni_ellis@sheknows.com", "name": "Sydni Ellis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Babies", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Babies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AdobeStock_657325164.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665145", "eventUri": "eng-9665145", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Kathy Hochul (D) said in a news release, according to The Hill.\n\nEmployees can have more than one breastfeeding break, but they must provide a valid reason to their employer, the New York State Department of Labor reported. The number of breaks employees receive is unique to them and is evaluated by their employer. Employees must be able to receive these breastfeeding breaks for up to three years after childbirth.\n\nNew York DOL reported that breastfeeding breaks are separate from regular or meal breaks, and employees must receive both types of breaks. Employees, though, can choose to shorten their breastfeeding break.\n\nEmployers are also required to find or create a lactation room for their employees who need to breastfeed, meeting all the requirements for the room. The main thing employers must avoid when offering a lactation room is that it can not be a restroom or a toilet stall.\n\nEmployees wishing to receive breastfeeding breaks must notify their employers, preferably before they return to work from leave. That way, their employer will have time to find a lactation room and change schedules if needed.\n\nAdditionally, the New York DOL stated that employees must submit a request to use a lactation room or another space as a lactation room to the person who has been designated to process requests. Employers have up to five days to respond to the request.\n\nNew York DOL claimed they created a policy on breastfeeding in the workplace \"as required by the law\" to ensure all employees \"know their rights\" and employers \"understand their responsibilities. \"\n\nNew York DOL stated that employers must give their employees this policy when they are hired and every year following, as well as when an employee returns from childbirth.\n\n\"From our nation-leading prenatal leave program to this legislation requiring employers to give breastfeeding mothers much-needed break time, our state is continuing to stand up for parents in the workplace and protect maternal and child health,\" Hochul said.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_parsons@townhall.com", "name": "Jamie Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation_room", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lactation room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_toilet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public toilet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prenatal development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Babies", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Babies", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Government Agencies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/4/d8df24f3-7485-4dfc-9a2b-7661015202d4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665145", "eventUri": "eng-9665145", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 29, "textEnd": 36}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

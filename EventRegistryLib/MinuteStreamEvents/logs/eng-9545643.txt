Battery EVs represented only 1% of global sales in the past year, well below Toyota's previously announced target of 202,000 vehicles.Toyota Motor is set to unveil its annual earnings report on Wednesday, expected to reflect a significant boost from the rising demand for hybrids. This surge in hybrid sales underscores the continued strength of the world's leading automaker, especially as enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs) appears to be cooling.\n\nDespite the anticipated record-breaking results, supported in part by a favorable exchange rate due to the weak yen, Toyota faces substantial challenges in key markets.In China, it is embroiled in a fierce price war, while in the U.S., consumers are grappling with increased borrowing costs, affecting sales.\n\nGlobally, Toyota is facing heightened competition from Chinese rivals, who are rapidly expanding their production of low-cost vehicles. Additionally, a safety test scandal at its Daihatsu compact car unit has impacted sales in Japan, tarnishing the Toyota group's reputation for quality and safety.\n\nIn February, Toyota raised its operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31 to 4.9 trillion yen ($31.87 billion), marking a record profit and an 80% increase from the previous year. Analysts expect the company to deliver an operating profit of 747 billion yen for the fourth quarter.\n\nAs global demand for battery-powered EVs has slowed, Toyota has capitalized on the opportunity by increasing sales of hybrids, which offer relatively higher profit margins than regular gasoline cars. Hybrids, pioneered by Toyota over a quarter of a century ago with the Prius, accounted for more than a third of the 10.3 million cars sold in the just-ended financial year, including those under the Lexus luxury brand.\n\nWhile Toyota leads in hybrid technology, it lags behind competitors in the EV market, such as Tesla and European and Chinese automakers. Battery EVs represented only 1% of global sales in the past year, well below Toyota's previously announced target of 202,000 vehicles.\n\nThe success of Toyota's business in China hinges on its EV strategy. Given Chinese consumers' preference for software-loaded cars, Toyota may face challenges until it releases next-generation models in China. According to Koji Endo, head of equities research at SBI Securities, Toyota's software capabilities are lagging behind.\n\nTo address this gap, Toyota announced a partnership with Chinese tech giant Tencent and unveiled two battery EVs for the Chinese market at the recent Beijing auto show.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 2024 calendar year, Toyota's sales in China declined by 1.6%, outperforming Japanese rivals Nissan and Honda but falling short of the 12.5% rise in passenger vehicle sales sector-wide. In the U.S., Toyota saw a 20% increase in sales to 565,000 vehicles over the same period.\n\nToyota's shares have surged 96% in the last year, including dividends, outpacing Tesla's 7.5% increase in dollar terms over the same period.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daihatsu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daihatsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tencent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Prius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109922229,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-858599,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545643", "eventUri": "eng-9545643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "dateEnd": "-03-04", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1298}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Sales growth is expected to cool, U.S. incentives are likely to increase and profits may fall slightly, he said.\n\nPart of the course correction in earnings for the coming fiscal year stems from a big investment in improving human capital at the home company as well as at dealers and suppliers, and huge outlays for next-generation technologies such as electrification.\n\nHere are the top five takeaways from Sato's blockbuster earnings announcement on May 8.\n\nRe-investment\n\nToyota is plowing its bumper profits back into long-term sustainability.\n\nThe automaker will spend about 380 billion yen ($2.51 billion) on improving human capital throughout its supply chain this fiscal year. That includes efforts to support wage increases and better working conditions at suppliers and dealers, and within its own offices and factories.\n\nAlso this year, Toyota will boost spending on R&D and capital expenditure and tilt the mix toward \"growth\" technologies. That covers electrification, hydrogen and other carbon-cutting powertrain systems as well as software-defined vehicles and artificial intelligence.\n\nToyota will inject 1.7 trillion yen ($11.24 billion) into those areas this fiscal year, amounting to a 500 billion yen ($3.3 billion) increase over spending in the fiscal year that just ended.\n\nToyota clearly isn't afraid to share the wealth if it brings a brighter future.\n\nTempered profit outlook\n\nThe ramped-up investment will partly eat into earnings.\n\nToyota forecast operating profit to decline some 20 percent to 4.3 trillion yen ($28.42 billion) this fiscal year from the record 5.35 trillion yen ($35.36 billion) posted in the year ended March 31. Net income is also seen falling 30 percent from the record just reported.\n\nGlobal retail sales are forecast to dip 1.3 percent to 10.95 million vehicles this fiscal year, from last fiscal year's record 11.09 million.\n\nStill, even Toyota's new net income goal of 3.57 trillion yen ($23.60 billion) amounts to a haul in the double-digit billions. And the net margin would fall to a still-robust 7.8 percent, from an exceptional 11 percent. Most carmakers would envy such a slowdown.\n\nDon't forget to factor in Toyota's famously conservative estimates: The company originally projected operating profit of 3 trillion yen ($19.83 billion) in the just-finished fiscal year. It ended up nearly doubling that.\n\nHybrids still hot\n\nToyota continues to bank on its trademark hybrid technology.\n\nToyota sold about 3.7 million hybrids in the just-ended fiscal year, up 32 percent from 2.8 million year before. Hybrids were one-third of global volume, up from 26 percent.\n\nThat trend will continue. Toyota sees hybrid sales zooming ahead 25 percent to 4.65 million this fiscal year. And they are likely to account for 42 percent of global volume.\n\nHybrids are good for the bottom line. Toyota says they are at least as profitable as its gasoline-only models, and usually more so. Thus, the more Toyota sells, the more profit it bankrolls.\n\nThe biggest challenge may be getting more hybrids. U.S. Toyota dealers have an average 15-day supply of all vehicles. But for hot-selling hybrids, inventories are just five to eight days.\n\nBy contrast, Toyota sold just 116,654 full-electric cars in the fiscal year that ended March 31. EV sales are forecast to increase 46 percent, but will still be only 171,000 in the current fiscal year.\n\nAs meager as those EV volumes might seem, they are even lower than what Toyota envisioned a year ago. Back then, the company said it would be selling 200,000 EVs a year by now.\n\nEV optimism\n\nSato said EVs still are not ready for prime time and that his short-term outlook is conservative.\n\nThe infrastructure is not there to support widespread battery-electric vehicle use, and the value-added proposition of EVs still is not attractive enough for mainstream customers, he said.\n\nBut after 2026, the \"situation might change,\" Sato said. \"So aiming at that period, we would like to make sure that we are ready to provide BEVs in a Toyota way.\"\n\nToyota is developing a next-generation EV architecture with a reworked platform and battery system. The technologies will debut in the upmarket Lexus brand and were previewed in concept vehicles at last year's Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo.\n\nToyota will increase the value-added proposition in these vehicles through better software and artificial intelligence, Sato said. A host of new services will be unlocked.\n\nThe way of making these EVs will also undergo a wholesale transformation, he said. \"The current production logic is no longer valid,\" Sato said. \"Car design will totally change.\"\n\nToyota is adapting its famed Toyota Production System to newer, more efficient methods.\n\nSaid Sato: \"EVs have all this potential.\"\n\nWhat's ahead for North America\n\nToyota's crucial North American operations bounced back to profitability in the fiscal year ended March 31. No longer hobbled by the pandemic or semiconductor shortages, the automaker recorded operating profit of 506.3 billion yen ($3.35 billion), reversing an operating loss of 74.7 billion yen ($493.7 million) the year before. Sales climbed 17 percent to 2.82 million.\n\nA combination of tight inventories, low incentives and booming shipments of higher-margin vehicles such as hybrids, crossovers and trucks helped plump up profits.\n\nNonetheless, Toyota was also cautious about the coming year. As U.S. pricing pressure heats up, CFO Yoichi Miyazaki said Toyota will join the fray of competitors raising incentives. Toyota needs to do that to capture volume, he said.\n\nToyota's spending in that area is already rising. In April, the company's average marketing outlays per vehicle more than doubled to $1,724 from $808 a year earlier, according to data from Motor Intelligence. That is much lower than the industry average of $3,081.\n\nBut Toyota's sales forecast foreshadows the challenge ahead: It predicts North American sales to inch ahead only 1.9 percent to 2.87 million vehicles in the current fiscal year.", "source": {"uri": "europe.autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News Europe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_greimel@europe.autonews.com", "name": "Hans Greimel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value added"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://europe.autonews.com/s3/files/styles/1024x512/public/Toyota%20Koji%20Sato%20Greimel%202024%20Arc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545643", "eventUri": "eng-9545643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 700, "textEnd": 705}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 1897, "textEnd": 1905, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

While late in the EV race and significantly behind Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Toyota's strength in hybrids came in handy as the EV hype cooled down. In late April, Toyota also revealed a partnership with Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY) in an effort to stay competitive. Besides using the help of Tencent to increase the appeal of its vehicles, Toyota is aware it needs a game change. But, such investments will weight on its near-term profits so the earnings guidance was not at all impressive.\n\nFor the January-March quarter, Toyota reported that operating profit surged 78%. What's even impressive is that for the year, it totaled 5.35 trillion yen or about $34.5 billion, which is the first time for a Japanese company to surpass 5 trillion yen. Also for the full fiscal year, Toyota recorded a record profit of 4.94 trillion yen, which amounts to about $31.9 billion, on revenue of 45.1 trillion yen. Global sales reached an all-time high as they surpassed 10.3 million units, fueled by a strong demand both in the home market, as well as North America and Europe. Hybrid sales alone rose 31% to 3.7 million units.\n\nUp to March 2025, Toyota guided for a 20% profit decline in with an operating profit of \u00a54.3 trillion which amounts $28 billion, down from earnings of \u00a55.3 trillion it reported for the fiscal year 2024. Chief executive Koji Sato emphasized that Toyota will be doing what is necessary to cement its positioning as it plans to invest \u00a51.7tn in AI and EVs it classifies as 'growth areas'. Toyota also announced its plans to buy back up to 3% of its shares worth \u00a51 trillion.\n\nToyota's journey of an automaker set to become a mobility company.\n\nSato's leadership has already shown results and the new CEO made it clear that Toyota will do whatever it takes to ensure growth, including the reshaping its hardware-focused business model to focus more on software that is integral component of the all-electric future of the industry. But, while its fiscal year 2024 report smashed its own forecast from February, Toyota opted for a more sober outlook for the fiscal year ahead. Blazing a trail in hybrids paid off this time, but Toyota is well aware that this is not the solution as it needs to get better in software in order to challenge Tesla and remain relevant in the all-electric era. Fortunately, although Toyota is far behind Tesla in the EV space, as well as it other EV peers, Toyota still managed to defend its title of the world's largest automaker by sales for the fourth consecutive year so its power should never be underestimated. After all, it teamed up with Tencent and unveiled two battery EVs for the Chinese market at the recent Beijing auto show. By pairing up with Tencent, Toyota will also get equipped for the AI arms race besides sharpening its EV competitive edge.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

But as a Japanese company fighting in the auto industry, we know we cannot let this lead widen further. We're going to think about how to pull off a game-changer,\" Miyazaki said.\n\nToyota last month said it sold 11.1 million vehicles across all brands in the 2023-24 fiscal year, up five% and the first time they have exceeded 10 million.\n\nA big factor was a 31% jump to 3.7 million in sales of hybrid vehicles -- combining internal combustion engines and batteries -- like the Corolla compact car and the RAV4 sports utility vehicle.\n\nSales of purely electric car sales were a much more modest 116,500.\n\n- Hybrid pioneer -\n\nToyota pioneered hybrid cars with its popular Prius model, but it and other Japanese automakers have been criticised for being slow to embrace purely battery-powered vehicles.\n\nBut its strategy appears finally to be paying off with signs that consumers are going cold on pure EVs because of high prices and worries about reliability, range and a lack of charging points.\n\nIn 2023, China overtook Japan as the world's biggest vehicle exporter, a change fuelled by the country's dominance in electric cars.\n\nToyota was also left standing by Elon Musk's EV giant Tesla in terms of market value, but the gap -- almost USD 1 trillion in 2021 -- has now narrowed sharply.\n\nToyota's share price has soared 34% this year, while that of Tesla -- which sold 1.8 million vehicles last year -- has dived 28% over the same period.\n\nToyota is however still aiming to sell 1.5 million EVs annually by 2026 and 3.5 million by 2030.\n\nIt is also hoping to mass-produce solid-state batteries, a potentially hugely important technological breakthrough that could mean faster charging times and greater range.\n\nToyota's unit sales rose 13.8% in North America in 2023-24, while climbing 10.8% in Europe and 8.7% in Japan, despite a production halt at its Daihatsu unit.\n\nIn China, the world's biggest electric car market where local firms such as BYD dominate, Toyota sold 1.9 million vehicles, a rise of only 1.4%.\n\nToyota shares closed down 0.55% at 3,579.0

The automaker said it plans to invest JPY2 trillion (US$13.79 billion) in its suppliers, growing the EV lineup and developing Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV).\n\nSource: Toyota, compiled by DIGITIMES Asia, May 2024\n\nAccording to Toyota's FY2024 financial report released on May 8, growing demand for HEVs and price revisions in North American and European markets favored the company's operating income. A weak yen also benefited its earnings outside Japan.\n\nToyota and Lexus sold over 10 million cars in fiscal 2024 ending in March, up 7.3% from the previous year. The carmaker said sales volume increased worldwide except Japan, where Daihatsu Motor and Toyota Industries Corporation suspended deliveries due to scandals.\n\nElectrified vehicles accounted for 37.4% of Toyota's total sales in the past fiscal year, with HEV contributing 3,594,000 cars.\n\nFor fiscal 2025 ending in March 2025, vehicle sales of Toyota and Lexus are expected to remain at a similar level to the previous year. However, the portion of electrified vehicles will likely rise to 46.4%.\n\nToyota said it plans to spend JPY2 trillion in fiscal 2025 on \"human resources\" and investment in transforming into a mobility company. Therefore, its operating income is expected to decline to JPY4.3 trillion.\n\nAccording to Toyota, JPY380 billion of the investment will help suppliers reduce labor costs and improve their working environment. At a press conference following the release of financial results, Toyota President Koji Sato said the company's performance was backed by a strong supply chain, which Toyota is determined to protect and develop, Nikkei Asia reported.\n\nThe automaker will spend JPY1.7 trillion in capital expenditure and R&D expenses to develop battery EVs, hydrogen vehicles, and SDVs.\n\nSimilar to many legacy carmakers, Toyota has faced fierce competition in China. The company managed to sell more than 1.9 million cars in fiscal 2024, a comparable level to the previous year. Toyota said steady demand for HEVs drove its sales.\n\nAccording to Nikkei Asia, Yoichi Miyazaki, Toyota's chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that the automaker will try to distance itself from the price war in the world's largest car market.

Toyota's highly successful hybrids have allowed it to exploit the softening in EV demand, but in the long run Toyota will still have to improve its EV range, and its latest financial report shows it is gearing up to do just that.\n\nAs the likes of GM, Ford, Mercedes and Volkswagen slash expensive EV ambitions in the U.S. and Europe because unsold vehicles were clogging up forecourts, Toyota has cashed in on its decision to concentrate on its strength in hybrids.\n\nHybrids have been big sellers in Europe and the U.S. as current EVs are shunned because of their high prices and lack of all-round utility. In Europe, many manufacturers were keen to demonstrate their virtue by early decisions to embrace politicians' desires to end the sale of new combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Europe was an early leader in the race, declaring in 2021 that it would go even faster and outlaw the sale of new ICE vehicles by 2030.\n\nFord Europe at a Financial Times conference in London Tuesday said it was rethinking that plan and would sell ICE vehicles if the public wanted them. The plan for eventual 100% electrification though remained. As EV sales stumble in Europe, other early adopters may have to reconsider their decisions. Volvo has also been quick to end ICE production in favor of EVs. JLR's Jaguar plans its rebirth next year solely on EVs.\n\nBut Toyota will still have to invest heavily in electrification and acknowledged that after its recent financial results. In its fourth financial quarter ended March 31, Toyota said its operating profit jumped 77% to the equivalent of $7.34 billion, compared with the same period of 2023. At the same time, Toyota announced it expected operating profit would fall 20% in the current financial year including increased but undisclosed spending on EVs.\n\nCreditSights, a Fitch solutions company, reckons Toyota still has a lot to do to gear up for the EV market.\n\n\"We applaud the investments that we believe should further its new energy vehicle offerings well beyond its hybrid electric vehicles, which account for more than one-third of its sales,\" CreditSights said in a report.\n\n\"Automotive profit improvement was driven by increased sales of hybrids and high margin vehicles and price revisions in North America and Europe,\" it said.\n\nCreditSights noted Toyota's automotive operating margin increased 4.7 percentage points to 11.2% in fiscal 2024. Electrified vehicles, of which 95% were hybrids, accounted for 37% of Toyota's vehicle sales in the financial year.\n\nCreditSights said Toyota expects EV sales will increase about 50% in the current financial year, but still only account for less than 2% of its global retail sales.\n\n\"While Toyota's electrified vehicle path has been heavily focussed on hybrids, it plans to accelerate investments in EVs and fuel cell technology beginning this financial year,\" it said.\n\nThe Financial Times Lex column said the forecast drop in operating profit shows Toyota is still playing catch up on EVs. But its expertise in hybrids and plug-in hybrids paid off handsomely as EV demand fell.\n\n\"But battery EVs still matter for Toyota because those vehicles are still propelling sales growth in China, one of its key markets,\" Lex said.\n\nEVs are expected to claim up to about 45% of all sales in the Chinese market this year.\n\nLex said thanks to its success with hybrids Toyota's share price nearly doubled in the past year, and shares trade at more than twice the valuation of close rival Volkswagen.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [],

Sato has wrapped his first year at the helm of Toyota Motor Corp., driving the world's biggest automaker to record sales, output and profit.\n\nTOKYO -- First, CEO Koji Sato drove Toyota Motor Corp. to across-the-board record results -- in profits, sales, revenue and production. Now, he's tapping the brakes to share the wealth.\n\nOutlining the best-ever earnings in a news conference Wednesday, the Toyota boss said his Japanese juggernaut will pull back from its red-hot expansion and reinvest its cash bonanza in suppliers, dealers, employees and a range of next-generation technologies, from electric cars to software.\n\nLooking ahead, Sato said the company will stomach lower profits - a projected 20-per-cent slide this fiscal year -- and tepid sales as it plows those bumper profits into the long game.\n\n\"We need this time of plateau for our long-term future growth,\" Sato said. \"We would like to make proactive efforts for future sustainable growth.\"\n\nOn tap is a 42-per-cent surge in investment in \"growth\" technologies, such as electrification, software defined vehicles and artificial intelligence, to the tune of \u00a51.7 trillion (US$11.2 billion).\n\nThat amounts to a $3.3 billion (all figures in USD) increase over spending in the just-ended fiscal year.\n\nToyota will also spend billions more on improving human capital, including efforts to support wage increases and better working conditions at suppliers and dealers, and inside its own offices and factories. Those outlays will tally some $2.5 billion.\n\nThe cash outlays are so big, the investments will eat into earnings this fiscal year, Toyota said.\n\nThe company forecast that its operating profit and net income will actually fall in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, retreating from the just-achieved records.\n\nLooking ahead, Toyota executives forecast global retail sales to dip 1.3 per cent to 10.95 million this fiscal year, from last fiscal year's high. Operating profit is pegged to slip 20 per cent to $28.4 billion through next March, and net income is expected to fall 39 per cent to $23.6 billion.\n\nGIVING BACK\n\nThe slowdown is part of an intentional pause Sato outlined early this year as part of an effort to regroup and stay profitable for the long run after sprinting to record sales and production.\n\n\"Now, we can manage the timing of our investment,\" Sato said.\n\nThe company needs taking stock of the way it does everything in an effort to boost efficiency and think outside the box for a new era of global competition, Sato said. Each employee is expected to devote 30 minutes a day to thinking about improving their own work and careers.\n\n\"Existing workloads should be reduced for the time being,\" Sato said. \"We should question whether a particular work is necessary or not. We might need to stop certain types of work.\"\n\nEarly this year, Toyota decided to pay its suppliers higher prices.\n\nThen it gave its Japanese workers their biggest wage hike in 25 years. And in April, it decided to tap its record profits to pay dealers in Japan $71 a month for every person they employ.\n\nThe campaign is meant to encourage better dealership working conditions, improve training and bolster employee recruitment and retention. Toyota is ladling out the largess this year to shore up its business partners in an economy pressured by inflation.\n\nThe carmaker sees the support helping ensure sustainable growth as the world transitions away from years of pandemic shutdowns and business interruptions.\n\nRECORDS, MORE RECORDS\n\nToyota can afford the breather thanks to a stellar year of financial achievement.\n\nFor the full fiscal year ended March 31 - Sato's first year at the helm - Toyota booked all-time highs in global sales, production, revenue, operating profit and net income.\n\nOperating profit nearly doubled to $35.4 billion, outstripping even the company's latest upward forecast revision from February.\n\nNet income just more than doubled from the previous fiscal year, reaching a new record of $32.7 billion. Revenue jumped 21 per cent to $298.1 billion, rounding out the financial record trifecta.\n\nThe Japanese giant produced a record 11.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year ended March 31, including output from Daihatsu and Hino. That total was up 4.5 per cent from the previous fiscal year, for a third straight year of increases.\n\nGlobal retail sales climbed five per cent to a record 11.1 million vehicles in the just ended fiscal year, including Daihatsu and Hino. Booming sales of hybrids powered the surge.\n\nToyota and other Japanese automakers need to channel that success into better product and more advanced technologies, especially in the digital arenas, to catch up to Chinese rivals, said Sanshiro Fukao, an auto analyst and senior fellow at Itochu Research Institute.\n\n\"The battlefield of auto industry seems to have started switching from electric vehicles to artificial intelligence rapidly and drastically,\" Fukao said. \"If Japanese OEMs spend a lot in R&D expenses or seek alliances with AI developers, it could decide their survival in the car industry.\"\n\nHYBRID HIGHS\n\nToyota sold some 3.7 million hybrids in the just-ended fiscal year, up 32 per cent from 2.8 million year before. Gasoline-electrics comprised a third of global volume, up from 26 per cent.\n\nBy contrast, Toyota sold 116,654 pure EVs in the fiscal year ended March 31. Still, that was more than triple the number it sold the previous year and up from exactly zero EVs in 2020.\n\nCFO Yoichi Miyazaki said customers are snapping up hybrids because they are green and efficient, and because technological improvements are also making them fun to drive. Prices have come down on par with gasoline-powered vehicles in some cases. And hybrids don't engender the range anxiety that full-electrics do because they don't require a recharging grid.\n\n\"Hybrids have become extremely attractive vehicles,\" Miyazaki said. \"Hybrid vehicles are selling extremely well in the North American market.\"\n\nIn the U.S., Toyota dealers have an average 15-day supply of all vehicles. But when it comes to hot-selling hybrids, inventories drop to just five to eight days, Miyazaki said.\n\nCrucially, Toyota said its hybrid vehicles are at least as profitable as its gasoline-only models and usually more profitable. Thus, the more they sell, the more profit they bankroll.\n\nToyota sees global hybrid vehicles zooming ahead 25 per cent to 4.7 million this fiscal year. They will likely account for 42 per cent of Toyota's worldwide volume, the company forecast.\n\nBattery-electric sales are forecast to increase 46 per cent to 171,000 vehicles in the current fiscal year through March 31, 2025.\n\nENDING STRONG\n\nIn the company's just-ended fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, Toyota's operating profit soared 77 per cent to $7.4 billion from $4.1 billion a year earlier. Toyota delivered a stellar double-digit operating profit margin of 10 per cent in the quarter, up from 6.5 per cent the year before.\n\nNet income nearly doubled to $6.5 billion in January-March, from $3.7 billion a year earlier.\n\nGlobal revenue rose 14 per cent to $73.2 billion in the quarter.\n\nToyota stormed ahead as the global semiconductor shortage eased and customers snapped up the company's trademark gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. The company cranked up its global manufacturing machine to record output.\n\nFavorable foreign exchange rates also helped, bolstering yen-denominated earnings and adding $2 billion to operating profit.\n\nDOMESTIC TROUBLE\n\nGlobal retail sales fell 5.4 per cent to 2.5 million vehicles in the quarter.\n\nConsolidated sales declined 7.9 per cent to 2.2 million in the period, including shipments from the company's Daihatsu minicar and Hino truck-making subsidiaries.\n\nNorth American sales rose 18 per cent to 655,000 vehicles; Europe increased 13 per cent to 308,000.\n\nDeliveries in the home market of Japan tumbled almost by half to 363,000.\n\nThe Toyota Group has been beset by a series of embarrassing quality scandals that forced production shutdowns and sales suspensions while tarnishing the company's reputation.\n\nToyota's truck-making unit Hino Motors was tripped up in 2022 after fudging emission certifications in uproar still looming over the company, which has been earmarked to merge with Mitsubishi Fuso, the Japanese truck-manufacturer owned by Daimler.\n\nIn December, its minicar subsidiary Daihatsu suspended global shipments after it was found to have rigged side-collision safety tests. Daihatsu had to stop shipments of all models.\n\nThen in January, Toyota halted worldwide shipments of 10 nameplates because engines supplied by Toyota Industries Corp. had undergone improper horsepower and torque testing.", "source": {"uri": "canada.autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_greimel@canada.autonews.com", "name": "Hans

(May 8, 2024) - A significant milestone was reached at Toyota's longest-standing U.S. vehicle manufacturing facility as the ninth-generation Camry, a symbol of the company's dedication to electrification and job stability in the United States, made its debut off the assembly line. The 2025 Camry, now powered by the advanced fifth-generation Toyota Hybrid System, marks a pivotal moment in Toyota's strategy towards a more electrified automotive future.\n\nKerry Creech, president of Toyota Kentucky, highlighted the importance of the workforce in achieving this milestone. \"Today's achievement underscores Toyota's commitment to secure employment and our ongoing investment in our team and facilities to support the production of electrified vehicles,\" Creech stated. This commitment is evidenced by Toyota's substantial investment exceeding $10 billion in the Georgetown plant and its surrounding communities, reinforcing its pledge to long-term job stability for its nearly 10,000 team members.\n\nMarkee Robinson, a production team leader at the plant, expressed gratitude for Toyota's consistent support for its employees. \"Toyota has provided me and my family with stability for many years, and I am confident it will continue to do so for many more,\" Robinson said. This sentiment reflects the broader impact of Toyota's operations on individual lives and communities.\n\nThe launch of the 2025 Camry is not just about introducing a new vehicle; it represents Toyota's ongoing efforts to innovate and adapt in a rapidly changing automotive landscape. The company's recent $1.3 billion investment in the Georgetown facility is aimed at enhancing electrification capabilities, including the production of a new battery electric SUV designed for the U.S. market.\n\nToyota's commitment to electrification is further underscored by its announcement of over $18.6 billion in investments into U.S. manufacturing operations since 2021. These investments are part of Toyota's broader strategy to offer a diverse range of electrified vehicles that meet various customer needs.\n\nGovernor Andy Beshear commended Toyota for its unwavering dedication to its workforce and community. \"Toyota continues to be a leading employer in Kentucky, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and stability for nearly 10,000 Kentuckians,\" Beshear remarked.\n\nSince its establishment in 1986, Toyota Kentucky has been at the forefront of Toyota's North American operations. The facility has played a crucial role in assembling some of Toyota's most popular models, including the Camry, which has been America's top-selling passenger car for 22 consecutive years.\n\nAbout Toyota: With over 65 years of presence in North America, Toyota is committed to advancing sustainable mobility through its Toyota and Lexus brands and its extensive dealership network. Employing more than 63,000 individuals across North America, Toyota has contributed significantly to automotive design, engineering, and assembly with nearly 47 million cars and trucks produced at its 12 manufacturing plants. By 2025, Toyota aims to further its commitment to electrification with its 13th plant in North Carolina focused on manufacturing automotive batteries for electrified vehicles. Currently offering 28 electrified vehicle options, Toyota leads in bringing electrified vehicles to the market.\n\nThis latest development from Toyota not only showcases its dedication to innovation and sustainability but also reaffirms its commitment to providing secure employment opportunities in the U.S., ensuring a brighter future for both the environment and local communities.", "source": {"uri": "drivespark.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "drivespark.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "irwin_mills@drivespark.com", "name": "Irwin Mills", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgetown, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid Synergy Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized Vehicles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.drivespark.com/img/2024/05/toyota-camry-1715289520283-1200x675_temp.jpg?10052024025731", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545643", "eventUri": "eng-9545643", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

It also plans to buy back up to 3 per cent of its shares worth \u00a51tn and signalled it would start unwinding more of its many cross-shareholdings.\n\nIn late April, Toyota unveiled a partnership with Tencent, the Chinese owner of the superapp WeChat, as foreign carmakers seek partnerships with Chinese companies to stay competitive in the country's cut-throat market.\n\nYoichi Miyazaki, Toyota's chief financial officer, said the Japanese carmaker was \"well behind\" its Chinese rivals in some areas, adding that it would need to \"endure\" several difficult years and avoid getting sucked into a price-cutting competition with local brands.\n\n\"We need to think about how we can bring about a game change\" through increased investment, Miyazaki added.\n\nIn the three months to the end of March, Toyota's operating profit rose 77 per cent from a year earlier to \u00a51.11tn, boosted by a sharp decline in the yen against the dollar.\n\nGroup sales of vehicles was mostly flat at 2.4mn units for the quarter as a series of safety and data scandals at some of its closest subsidiaries hurt sales in Japan. The company sold 374,000 vehicles in China, down 1.6 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nThe group, which includes Daihatsu and Hino Motors, expects to sell 10.4mn vehicles in the current financial year, compared with 10.3mn vehicles in the previous year.\n\nKoji Endo, head of equity research at SBI Securities, said the biggest surprise was Toyota's large share buyback plan, which could reflect broader governance changes at the Japanese group.\n\nHe also added that \"a pause\" in Toyota's profit growth was inevitable, with the company's large network of suppliers and staff worn out by production disruptions caused by a safety test scandal at Toyota's subsidiary Daihatsu.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tencent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WeChat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daihatsu", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daihatsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hino_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hino Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F3d2f1b27-4509-4f4e-b8b7-7e146217a19a.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545643", "eventUri": "eng-9545643", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

This is a significant shift in strategy for the Japanese giant, which has long advocated for hydrogen fuel cell technology to be the future of sustainable transportation.\n\nSpearheading this transformation is Toyota's CEO, Koji Sato. Under his leadership, the company has recently seen record profits, and now Sato is channeling these earnings directly back into the company's electric future. This is a significant shift away from Toyota's aggressive sales expansion and towards a long-term growth strategy centered around next-generation mobility solutions.\n\nToyota is not holding back on this investment - a staggering \u20ac10.44 billion will be dedicated to the research and development of new EVs and sophisticated AI-based software systems. This substantial financial commitment underscores Toyota's determination to catch up in an arena increasingly dominated by EV pioneers like Tesla, instilling confidence in the company's commitment to innovation.\n\nBut why the sudden interest in EVs? Toyota's historic focus on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) hasn't waned. The company remains firm in its belief that hydrogen will ultimately prevail as the cleanest energy source for cars. However, Toyota seems to recognize the need for a pragmatic two-step approach.\n\nBy investing heavily in EVs, the company ensures it stays afloat in this rapidly evolving market while continuing to pursue its hydrogen aspirations. This approach involves developing EVs for the mass market while continuing to invest in FCVs for specific applications, such as commercial vehicles and long-distance transportation.\n\nThe investment in AI is equally strategic. As industry experts note, the automotive battleground is shifting toward artificial intelligence. Today, cars are increasingly becoming computers on wheels, and AI-driven technologies are redefining the driving experience. For instance, AI can enhance safety by detecting and responding to potential hazards faster than a human driver, and it can also improve comfort and convenience by personalizing the in-car experience based on individual preferences.\n\nToyota's massive investment promises more innovation and choice in the electric marketplace. It will likely take time for these developments to trickle down into the showrooms. Still, consumers can expect Toyota's EVs to eventually offer better performance, longer range, and advanced technological features.", "source": {"uri": "arenaev.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArenaEV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://st.arenaev.com/news/24/05/toyota-doubles-down-on-electric-vehicles/-828x414/arenaev_001.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545643", "eventUri": "eng-9545643", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The 42-year-old formerly presented CITV, CBBC, Top of the Pops, Celebrity Juice, and Love Island, before turning to writing self-help books and hosting her chart-topping mental wellbeing podcast, Happy Place. She opened up about the brutality of the entertainment industry as she likened the work to being in a \u201cpit of lions\u201d. Cotton said she\u2019d been sacked \u201ca million times\u201d, and twice from TV work in the last ten years. \u201cI\u2019d get a week down the line and go, \u2018I feel ill \u2014 I can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d she told The Times. She said her anxiety had escalated into panic attacks, adding said, \u201cI got to the point where I just thought, \u2018Why am I doing this to myself? Am I that desperate to be seen or heard?\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve learnt that I couldn\u2019t do live radio or TV today for any money in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought of going on to someone else\u2019s platform [with] that level of risk and judgment, and that element of the unknown? My nervous system can\u2019t take it \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely shot. Putting myself in that is like putting me in a pit of lions.\u201d She added: \u201cAll my mental health lows are because of my job. Nothing else. It is not conducive to a balanced mind.\u201d In addition to the pressure of the work, Cotton also said she fears cancel culture. She said: \u201cYou could do one thing and you\u2019re done, you\u2019re dead. Bye! Everyone\u2019s waiting for you to cock up so they can all point fingers and say that you\u2019ve always been terrible.\u201d Blaming \u201ctall poppy syndrome\u201d \u2013 a theory that posits successful people are more liable to criticism in order to trim them down \u2013 she said, \u201cIt\u2019s in our culture to try to level people out.\u201d \u201cWe celebrate the new person on the scene, but then as soon as you\u2019re established, people cannot wait for you to f*** up \u2026 I also think I\u2019ve had positive feedback from what I\u2019m doing now because I\u2019ve actively chosen to step away from the shiny stuff [TV and radio] \u2014 and people like that.\u201d As the podcast host releases her 15th book and her first fictional title, Scripted, she revealed she\u2019d been unceremoniously fired from TV jobs on multiple occasions. \u201cI\u2019ve been sacked a million times,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been sacked and not told I\u2019ve been sacked. You just turn the telly on and someone else is doing your job.\u201d Although she declined to name the shows, she said it had happened twice in the past ten years. \u201cIt\u2019s all a big game. You\u2019ve got the Monopoly board out and you\u2019re moving around [trying to] dodge the danger.\u201d", "summary": "<p>\u2018All my mental health lows are because of my job,\u2019 said the \u2018Happy Place\u2019 star </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/fearne-cotton-tv-radio-anxiety-b2559454.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/15/newFile.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XhBcylqV-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:29:11", "author": "Maira Butt", "authors": ["Maira Butt"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.111}

According to preliminary information received by the Railways Ministry, seven coaches of the train (A1, A3, B6, B7, B9, B10 and B5), all AC-2 tier and AC-3 tier, were targeted by thieves between 2 am and 3 am. A senior official of the ministry told PTI that a three- member Railway Police Force escort team of the train would be interrogated in the matter.\n\nThe incident came to light when the train was arriving at Rajasthan's Kota junction and the passengers woke up to find their purses and small hand bags emptied and dumped near the toilets and vestibules, as per the FIRs lodged by some passengers with the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Nizamuddin Station.\n\nWhile the RPF told the passengers to register their FIRs at the junction, most of them decided to do so in Nizamuddin. As of now, 11 FIRS have been filed in the case. Many passengers complained of missing cash. Some said their I-phones, other electronic devices were missing and complained of Aadhar card and other essential documents.\n\nSome in their FIRs, alleged that they were drugged as the passengers slept soundly through the robbery. Many people even expressed apprehensions about the involvement of rail staff in the incident. \"Earlier, instances of dacoity have been reported and they are coming down now...We are taking all steps necessary. CCTV cameras are being installed in coaches to keep a check on such incidents. It's unfortunate that this has happened,\" Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said.\n\nSources in the ministry said that it was being probed if any railway staff was involved in the incident and if it was found to be true, strict action will be taken against them. \"The ministry is coordinating with the respective GRP in the matter,\" said Anil K Saxena, spokesperson, Indian Railways.\n\nThe number of robberies from January-June 2016 was 360, while in the same period this year, the number reduced to 345. The number of cases of dacoity during January-June 2016 were 24, as compared to 17 during the same period this year.\n\nThe Mumbai-Nizamuddin Rajdhani is one of the premium and most sought-after trains on the route. In April, robbers struck the Delhi-Patna Rajdhani Express at a place in Bihar and stole cash and jewellery worth lakhs from sleeping passengers. The robbery raised questions about security in the country's main train service.\n\nRailway officials said the cases have been registered under section 380 (theft) of Indian Penal Code.", "id": "9589431", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "25 people allegedly drugged, robbed onboard Mumai-Delhi Rajdhani Express", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/Rajdhani-Express-IE.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2183, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2200, "freq": 2, "date": "2016-01-", "dateEnd": "2016-06-"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ratl\u0101m"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "52193", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratlam", "label": {"eng": "Ratl\u0101m"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of R\u0101jasth\u0101n"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "52279", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "label": {"eng": "State of R\u0101jasth\u0101n"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "53284", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kota"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "53497", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan", "label": {"eng": "Kota"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "54715", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robbery"}, "id": "304218", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lakh"}, "id": "306100", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Suresh Prabhu"}, "id": "316722", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Prabhakar_Prabhu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indian Railways"}, "id": "338527", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aadhaar"}, "id": "342193", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_Identification_Authority_of_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Minister of Railways (India)"}, "id": "352974", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Railways_(India)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dacoity"}, "id": "415423", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacoity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ministry of Railways (India)"}, "id": "454052", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Railways_(India)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Railroad police"}, "id": "470128", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_police"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station"}, "id": "511631", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat_Nizamuddin_railway_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "August Kranti Rajdhani Express"}, "id": "635207", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Kranti_Rajdhani_Express"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajendra Nagar Patna Rajdhani Express"}, "id": "1304261", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Nagar_Patna_Rajdhani_Express"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 608, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1018, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1019, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Miniature", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Miniature"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1044, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1107, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations"}], "time": "00:38:00"}

By 5.30 am, as some passengers on the August Kranti Rajdhani from Mumbai to Delhi, woke up near Kota in Rajasthan, it was all over.\n\nIn one of the most high-profile cases of train theft in recent years, cash and valuables worth lakhs were stolen from around 20 passengers on the Rajdhani by thieves who, police suspect, were travelling in the train as bona fide, ticket-holding passengers.\n\nAccording to a preliminary assessment by Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP), the thieves are suspected to have got going after the train had crossed Vadodara at around 10.30 pm and most of the passengers had fallen asleep.\n\nBased on passengers' accounts, investigators have concluded that the thieves completed the job near Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh between 2 am and 3 am -- Ratlam is the only stop for the train between Vadodara and Kota.\n\nOfficials said the train was being escorted by three RPF constables that night. The thefts took place in AC-2 and AC-3 coaches of the train, which has 11 halts between Mumbai and Delhi.\n\n\"There was no chain-pulling, which is what local gangs do to flee after stealing. Plus, the circumstances in which empty wallets were found point towards bona-fide passengers who did the job with ample time in hand,\" a senior RPF official told The Indian Express. Some empty wallets were recovered from toilets and vestibules.\n\n\"We have tried to zero down on certain possibilities of the case. In past cases, involvement of the catering staff has been witnessed, either partly or completely. We have taken statements from the staff present inside the train,\" said Rajinder Malik, Chief Security Commissioner, Jabalpur, West Central Railway. Malik ruled out the possibility of the passengers having been drugged by the robbers.\n\nInvestigators are also studying case histories of crime incidents on this route over the last 18 months to see if there is a pattern.\n\nWhile a group of passengers got off in Mathura, 11 passengers filed separate FIRs at the GRP station at the Nizamuddin station in Delhi.\n\nAccording to these FIRs, cash worth Rs 2.5 lakh, apart from gold jewellery, six mobile phones, credit and debit cards, PAN and Aadhaar cards and passports were among the items stolen. One passenger claimed to have been carrying Rs 1.25 lakh in cash.\n\n\"My wife's wallet is missing. It had Rs 21,400 in cash, a mobile phone, Aadhaar card, house keys and other important things,\" said Ramesh Kalra, who had boarded the train with his wife in Borivali.\n\n\"We lost at least Rs 15,000 in cash and other belongings. We were part of a group of 13 heading towards Mathura for a religious visit. Most of our belongings were stolen from the section in which the women with us were travelling,\" said Piyush Singh, a resident of Bhayander.\n\n\"Cash worth Rs 15,000 along with mobile phones and debit cards of my mother have been stolen. We have registered a case,\" said Aklam Shaikh, from Mira Road.\n\nRailway Minister Suresh Prabhu said these incidents have been happening for years. \"These crimes have been taking place for years, and now they have come down. But we are trying to make things more secure for passengers by installing CCTV cameras in coaches,\" said Prabhu.\n\nAccording to official figures, there has been a 33 per cent increase in theft of passengers' belongings in the Railways system when compared to last year. Between January to June this year, there have been 12,573 such cases, compared to 9,436 during the same period last year.\n\nIn this case, the GRP in Nizamuddin has lodged FIRs under Section 380 of the IPC, which deals with theft, punishable with imprisonment up to seven years and a fine. The FIRs have been transferred to the Ratlam GRP.\n\nEarlier this year, a woman travelling in the same train had accused a catering staff of stealing her jewellery. The RPF has constituted a three-member team to assist the state police forces of three states in the probe.\n\nHowever, going by past record, these investigations get stuck for months due to disputes between states and even districts within a state over jurisdiction.\n\nThe Railways has maintained that since law and order is a state subject, the RPF patrolling of a running train is deployed as per inputs from states and past trends.\n\nThe Railways is planning to launch upgraded services of Rajdhanis and Shatabdis from October with CCTV cameras on coaches -- but not all coaches will have the facility, to begin with.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "id": "9576076", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Midnight theft on Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani,

The RPF believes that thieves who stole valuables and cash worth Rs 10-15 lakh from sleeping passengers on board August Kranti Rajdhani may have followed a pattern, for similar thefts were reported on Rajdhani trains on two earlier occasions, a senior rail official said. The digital footprints of passengers travelling on August Kranti on August 16 were being scanned to see if any of them travelled on the Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani on August 9, when three passengers complained of thefts under similar circumstances. \"We are checking to see if groups of passengers travelled on both the trains and also scanning them on the basis of gender, age and other parameters,\" a senior official of the ministry said. Twenty-five passengers on the Mumbai-Delhi August Kranti Rajdhani Express said cash and valuables worth Rs 10-15 lakh were stolen from their compartments early Wednesday. Many complained of being drugged and accused the railway pantry staff as well other employees of being involved. \"We are also checking if bookings were made with the same user IDs online and if they were given any fare concessions. We are coordinating with the police in Mumbai, Ratlam and Kota and talking to staff members,\" the official said.\n\nThe thefts took place in AC-2 and AC-3 coaches of the train, which has 11 halts between Mumbai and Delhi. A similar incident took place in July, when passengers aboard the Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani complained of thefts. Another common link between the latest incident and the two earlier ones is the suspected location of the thefts. The incidents occurred between the Baroda and Kota junctions. The theft on the August Kranti Rajdhani is suspected to have occurred near the Ratlam junction in Madhya Pradesh, which falls between the two junctions. Officials said sleuths were studying CCTV footage from the entire route. The union ministry had de-rostered seven coach attendants, one in each affected coach, and seven housekeeping staff. According to official figures, there has been a 33 per cent increase in theft of passengers' belongings as compared to last year. Between January and June this year, there have been 12,573 such cases, compared to 9,436 during the same period last year.", "id": "9897462", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Rajdhani theft: Role of 'ticketed passengers' being probed", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/Rajdhani-EP2.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 192, "amb": false, "textEnd": 201, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16"}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 668, "date": "2017-08-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 676}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "51427", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ratl\u0101m"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "52193", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratlam", "label": {"eng": "Ratl\u0101m"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "53284", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kota"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "53497", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan", "label": {"eng": "Kota"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "54715", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lakh"}, "id": "306100", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}, "id": "306110", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajadhani Express"}, "id": "418565", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajdhani_Express"}, {"label": {"eng": "Railway Protection Force"}, "id": "489169", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Protection_Force"}, {"label": {"eng": "August Kranti Rajdhani Express"}, "id": "635207", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Kranti_Rajdhani_Express"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mumbai Rajdhani Express"}, "id": "691423", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Rajdhani_Express"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 72, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 457, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 608, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1008, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Driving and Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Driving_and_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1018, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1107, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations"}], "time": "13:00:00"}

More than Rs 21,000 cash was missing, but other things, including mobile phones, were inside it,\" she said.\n\n\"We immediately alerted our co-passengers and soon found that nearly 12 passengers lost their purses. The purses were found wrapped in blanket near toilet, in dustbin and even in kitchen oven. When the train made a brief halt at Kota junction, we alerted the GRP and RPF. Had police detained and questioned the staff of railway at Kota junction, the robbed cash, jewellery and i-phones would had been recovered,\" she said.\n\n\"The thieves took only expensive i-phones, and left the Samsung and other brands phone in the purse. Fortunately, they left my Motorola phone too. There is a high chance that we were drugged with some intoxicant spray before being robbed,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the victims of Rajdhani, over Rs 15 lakh cash and valuables, including diamond jewellery, foreign currency of an NRI passenger, were stolen. The passengers also claimed that the thieves had used some kind of spray to drug them and rob them, as women generally keep their purses beneath their heads or in secure place which is accessible to them only.\n\nA K Mahajan, former senior executive manager of a bank, who was traveling in train, said, \"Railway police failed to listen to our pleas. They did not act promptly. Now, who will return my Rs 70,000 cash and two i-phones which were stolen from my wife's purse?\"\n\nAnother woman passenger who did not wish to be named said, \"I confronted a man, who was inspecting our luggage with a mobile phone torch. He identified himself as a railway staff and claimed that he was checking berth numbers.\"\n\nYogesh Agrawal, a businessman of Mathura, who was traveling along with his wife in II tier coach of Rajdhani, said, \"The thieves took away Rs 1.25 lakh cash and left my wife's purse under berth number five.\"\n\n\"Without the help of railway staff nobody can dare steal our belongings,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to TOI, Anil Saxena, additional director-general and public relation officer of the railway board said, \"GRP is investigating the matter, but based on prima facie probe, we can certainly say that no intoxicant spray was used.\"\n\nClick here to watch the video\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your

Apart from that, we have directed the team to step up security of the route by implementing certain measures. A daily update of the findings from the investigation will be briefed to the Railway Board,\" said Rajinder Malik, IG, RPF,Jabalpur division, West Central Railway.\n\nThe Indian Express has learnt that Railways is not taking even token penal action against the three RPF constables escorting the Mumbai-Delhi August Kranti Rajdhani because they started escorting the train Ratlam onwards. In the onboard complaint forms filled up by passengers, a few have mentioned that the theft might have taken place before Ratlam, when the train was unescorted. If that turns out to be true, the RPF sources said, punishing the constables would be difficult.\n\nSo investigators started calling those passengers on Thursday to understand their versions better. \"Some people said that there might have been some sedative involved because they are not used to such deep sleep that left them completely unaware of the theft. But we have not yet found evidence of drugging,\" said a senior RPF officer. The train is now being escorted by security personnel throughout the route, railways said.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "id": "9798028", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Theft on Rajdhani: Railways yet to identify exact spot, no one suspended", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/mumbai-delhi-rajdhani-759.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 54, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 69}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51427", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ratl\u0101m"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "52193", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratlam", "label": {"eng": "Ratl\u0101m"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "54715", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Actor"}, "id": "302943", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sleep"}, "id": "305391", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "id": "305935", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}, "id": "312253", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}, "id": "328671", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sedative"}, "id": "353217", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dileep (actor)"}, "id": "416624", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dileep_(actor)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajadhani Express"}, "id": "418565", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajdhani_Express"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station"}, "id": "511631", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat_Nizamuddin_railway_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "Remya Nambeesan"}, "id": "833188", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remya_Nambeesan"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Central Railway zone"}, "id": "1045900", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Central_Railway_zone"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 457, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 608, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1018, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1019, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Miniature", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Miniature"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1044, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1107, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations"}], "time": "00:07:00"}

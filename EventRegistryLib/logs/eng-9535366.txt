The victim's mother discovered the text messages when she took the victim's phone after she caught him talking to Bergmann earlier in the week.\n\nOfficers were presented with screenshots of multiple text conversations between the victim and Bergmann talking about their encounters, which allegedly occurred inside the classroom during lunch or after school.\n\nIn text messages, Bergmann allegedly also told the child that she liked when the victim touched her and that she enjoyed \"making out\" with him\n\nVictim and Bergmann Wrote Handwritten Notes to Each Other\n\nCharges say the victim told investigators that he talked to Bergmann \"almost daily,\" and that he got her number when he went skiing with her and his mother at Afton Alps over winter break. Bergmann also told police she received the boy's number then in case they were separated at the park.\n\nInside Bergmann's backpack, an officer reports they found a folder with the victim's name on it containing many handwritten notes. The victim later told police that he and Bergmann would write each other notes throughout the day. Many of the letters talk about the two kissing each other, court documents say.\n\nIn one of the letters, Bergmann allegedly wrote, \"One of my cousins is in the 5th grade and I can't imagine a man talking to her how we talk.

She was an Assistant Center Director at Sylvan Learning for four years while she was in school. Bergmann got engaged to her fianc\u00e9 Ben in December.

Please read with caution.\n\nMadison Bergmann, an engaged 24-year-old female Wisconsin school teacher was arrested for allegedly \"making out\" with one of her 5th-grade male students, and her fianc\u00e9 has spoken out about the status of their wedding, the New York Post reported.\n\nBergmann told the police her abusive relationship with the 11-year-old boy began when she accompanied the kid's family on a ski trip. Why Bergmann was invited is unclear. Bergmann and the boy exchanged cell phone numbers while skiing, she said, and he called her several times on the outing.\n\nBergmann and the child then started texting each other and speaking on the phone, passing inappropriate notes to each other in class, and allegedly \"kissing\" when the boy stayed after school and during lunch. Bergmann is also accused of secretly touching the child in class. Reportedly, Bergmann told her student she loved him and was \"obsessed\" with him.\n\nIn late April 2024, the boy's mother caught her son and Bergmann talking on the phone. She told her son he had crossed a boundary and emailed Bergmann, telling the teacher to no longer contact the boy. The child's father, however, discovered inappropriate messages between Bergmann and his son and reported Bergmann to the school.\n\nBergmann was placed on administrative leave and arrested on first-degree child sexual assault charges, according to CBS News. She was expected to appear in court in late May. Bergmann was engaged to marry her fianc\u00e9, Sam Hickman, just a few months after she got caught. Speaking with the New York Post, Hickman's friend said the wedding was \"indefinitely postponed.\"\n\nHickman's friend said the following,\n\n\"Sam is really upset and heartbroken. He's embarrassed and p****d. He didn't deserve this. Everyone is p****d ... He says it's f***ed up that she cheated with a little kid. He's really, really hurt.

It was revealed that the police were alerted to concerning behavior at River Crest Elementary School in Hudson. The police charge sheet reportedly mentions inappropriate conduct between Bergmann and a 5th-grade student.\n\nThe victim's parents provided authorities with screenshots of text messages between the victim and Bergmann, discovered by them. She was reportedly texting the child \"daily\" and telling him how much she enjoyed \"making out\" with him and him touching her.\n\nAccording to police reports, these incidents occurred at the school, either during lunch breaks or after school hours.\n\nThe police reportedly found a folder inside Bergmann's bag, which had the victim's name on it and contained several handwritten notes that detailed their physical interactions.\n\nHowever, Bergmann disclosed that she obtained the child's phone number from his mother in December. This happened during a winter break trip to the Afton Alps.\n\nThe school's Principal Kimberly Osterhues in a message to parents said, \"We are shocked and disturbed by this news. Our primary concern is for the well-being of the River Crest School community and the children affected.\"\"\n\nBergmann was released on a bond of $25,000 and is not allowed to enter school premises or attend school events.

The victim's parents learned their son and the suspect were talking on the phone after school on Monday, leading them to confiscate his phone and report the evidence of sexual abuse they found, the local CBS affiliate added.\n\nAuthorities allege that letters inside a folder in the defendant's backpack showed the engaged teacher telling the child victim she loved him \"more than anyone in the world.\"\n\n\"One of my cousins is in the 5th grade and I can't imagine a man talking to her how we talk. I know we have a special relationship and I do love you more than anyone in the world but I have to be the adult here and stop,\" Bergmann allegedly said.\n\nIn one alleged text exchange, the victim said, \"Haha bro I just want to make out with you.\" The teacher is accused of replying with, \"I do too!

to GPS monitoring while out on bond, limiting her to traveling \"no more than 100 miles from Hudson, WI,\" which is located right across from Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., separated by the St. Croix River.\n\nThe docket in Bergmann's case shows that there is a status conference set for May 30, just before noon, as well as a preliminary hearing at 9 a.m. on June 14.\n\nLaw&Crime reached out

Those plans were reportedly put on hold this week when the jilted betrothed learned the \"f-ked up\" details about the elementary school teacher allegedly getting \"turned on\" by her 11-year-old victim.\n\nAccording to charging documents, parents had learned of the alleged criminal behavior of Bergmann Monday when the boy had been discovered on the phone with the teacher. A review of months of text exchanges between the two had them confronting administrators at River Crest Elementary School where, Wednesday, the teacher was led away in handcuffs before being released on $25,000 signature bond.\n\nReporting on some of the contents of the messages, WCCO detailed one exchange between the victim and the teacher where he allegedly said, \"HAHA BRO I JUST WANT TO MAKE OUT WITH U.\"\n\nTo that, Bergmann was said to have responded, \"I DO TOO! LIKE ALLLLL THE TIME.\"\n\nCourt documents also alleged that kissing and touching between the teacher and student included regular exchanges of notes throughout the day, with one such message discovered in Bergmann's bag in a folder labeled with the victim's name described, \"she tells him that she loves him, wants to kiss him, he turns her on and that she is obsessed with him..\"\n\nSpeaking with the New York Post, a friend of Hickman explained of the wedding that had been scheduled for the end of July, \"It's been indefinitely postponed.\"\n\n\"And it probably won't happen. Sam is really upset and heartbroken. He's embarrassed and pissed. He didn't deserve this. Everyone is pissed,\" the friend continued of the mutually agreed upon status. \"It was more like, 'Well obviously it's not going to happen this summer.' Pretty much all that there is to say.\"\n\n\"He says it's f-ked up that she cheated with a little kid,\" the Post was told. \"He's really really hurt. Not talking too much about it, just like 'this is f-ked up.'\"\n\nAs far as the beginning of the alleged sexual assault, court documents indicated that Bergmann had initially been given the victim's phone number by the mother when the family had invited the teacher to come along with them to the skiing resort Afton Alps over winter break.\n\nHaving placed her on administrative leave and removed her name from the school's staff directory, officials from the district put out a statement that read in part, \"Learning about a school staff member and alleged inappropriate conduct that breaches trust is deeply troubling for all of us.\"\n\n\"We understand the gravity of this situation and are committed to providing the necessary support for any child who may be impacted,\" the statement added.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

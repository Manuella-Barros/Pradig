Moreover, Alsauarka was a Hamas sniper in the Beit Hanoun region who participated in multiple attacks on IDF soldiers. Alsauarka was located in Beit Hanoun after an extensive search, the IDF said. The Israeli military also released video footage of the strike on Alsauarka. He is one of numerous senior Hamas commanders to have been eliminated during the IDF's response to the October 7 atrocities.\n\n\"In the wake of the October 7 Hamas massacre of more than 1,200 people, Israel has sought to track down Hamas leaders responsible for these heinous crimes. The elimination of a leading Hamas terror commander and sniper is another step towards the defeat of Hamas in Gaza. His presence in a civilian area once again illustrates how Hamas exploits civilian homes to hide its armed personnel.\" -- Seth J. Frantzman, FDD Adjunct Fellow\n\n\"Israel is employing a dual-pronged strategy against Hamas and its allies. On one front, it is working to cripple the military apparatus established by terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip, aiming to disable their ability to launch future attacks against the Jewish state. Concurrently, Israeli authorities are actively pursuing those responsible for the massacre, targeting high-ranking officials, commanders, and foot soldiers within Hamas and other terrorist organizations.\" -- Joe Truzman, Senior Research Analyst at FDD's Long War Journal\n\nIsraeli forces continue to operate in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where two of the four Hamas battalions still there have already been significantly degraded. \"Over the past day, a mortar shell launch post used to fire at IDF troops was struck by IDF aerial and artillery forces.

And immediately after him the Chief of Staff, too. Just this morning I wrote that we should all stand behind the IDF. But if the chief of staff meddles in politics, and if both strive to unseat a legally elected government, their place is not in the army. After all the denials and lies, I have no doubt: the high command is rebelling against the government. And the prime minister should clear the army of all those responsible for the October 7 failure. I don't understand how [chief of staff] Halevi, [military intelligence chief] Haliva, and [shin bet chief] Ronen Bar are still here.\"\n\nIn an interview on Channel 13, Hagari suggested again there was no real possibility of destroying Hamas. \"The matter of destroying Hamas or making it disappear is simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" he said. According to Hagari, the way to weaken the terrorist organization is to establish a new government in the Strip, something the Israeli government can do. \"Hamas is an idea, it is a party, and it is rooted in the hearts of the people. Anyone who thinks we can make it disappear is wrong,\" he added.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Hagari's statement, saying: \"The political-security cabinet headed by me has defined as one of the goals of the war the destruction of Hamas's military and governmental capabilities, and the IDF is of course committed to this.\"\n\nSenior Likud officials and right-leaning journalists overnight Wednesday fiercely attacked the IDF spokesman following his interviews on 14 and the other three channels, in which he reiterated that Israel was unable to totally destroy Hamas, and justified banning Winter from speaking.\n\nIT'S ABOUT GANTZ'S QUITTING, STUPID\n\nChannel 14's military correspondent Hillel Biton Rosen hinted that there may be a connection between Gantz's resignation from the government and Hagari's statements: \"IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari was formerly the assistant and chief of staff to Eisenkot and Gantz, and since they resigned from the government, Hagari has issued a statement to the media about a temporary truce in Rafah without cabinet approval; released a message to the media against News 14 commentator Yaakov Bardugo, who is considered a prominent critic of the IDF; and disapproved of the goals of the war as defined by the Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"The opposition spokesman, oops, sorry, the IDF spokesman is allowed everything!! Everything!!\" Likud MK Tali Gottlieb tweeted Wednesday night and added the following litany of gripes: \"He can brief that there are no armaments only because the IDF brass wants to end the war. To brief that Palestinian workers must be allowed into Israel otherwise, there will be terrorism. To brief that humanitarian aid is required even though it goes to Hamas. To inform you that our soldiers harmed the late female soldier Noam Marciano when they attacked Shifa Hospital to justify not attacking hospitals even though they serve as terrorist headquarters. To announce that certain events are 'unfamiliar,' meaning that the IDF spokesman doesn't want you to know about them. To wait with false denials about the transfer of forces from the south to Huwara (in Samaria - DI) only because it serves leftist worldviews. To brief on a ceasefire without updating the cabinet, and then change his mind. To be interviewed on every television channel and to go against the goals of the war and blacken the government's face. This is the IDF Spokesman.\"\n\n\"What more needs to be done to understand that IDF brass holds a radical leftist political agenda which in the type of war we are in is a defeatist agenda? Don't say I didn't tell you. Long ago,\" MK Gottlieb concluded.\n\nCommunications Minister Shlomo Karhi (Likud) tweeted Wednesday night: \"The words of the IDF spokesman this evening are only a reflection of the lax commanding spirit of the Chief of Staff and the Minister of Defense.\n\n\"We have superhero warriors and a security leadership that doesn't deserve them.\n\n\"Instead of thinking that he is still Gantz's and Eisenkot's chief of staff and letting them speak from his throat, the IDF spokesman should concentrate on strengthening our fighters and have his commanders Herzi and Gallant strive for victory!

Gen. Barak Hiram to ascend to the post of commander of the Gaza Division.\n\nHiram has been one of the most controversial commanders of the war.\n\nOn one hand, he allegedly gave controversial orders to fire on residential units which included both Hamas terrorists and hostages, potentially killing the hostages.\n\nEven this narrative is debated, as his attack order may have been focused on saving his soldiers who were under fire, and it is also debated as to whether there was any way to secure the hostages release without attacking the Hamas guards who held them.\n\nIn any event, the other side of the coin has been that after October 7, Hiram was highly successful in a number of battles.\n\nFurther, his command skills were viewed as significantly responsible for ousting Hamas from Beeri at a time when other nearby commanders had been killed or had fled.\n\nThis means that some hostage families would raise an outcry if he were given that Gaza Division command, while many in the military would object if he is not given the command, viewing him as one of the most successful and battle-tested commanders.\n\nOn June 5, the IDF announced that it would start presenting its probes related to Hamas's October 7 invasion and the following ongoing Gaza war on a rolling basis during the months of July and August.\n\nAspects of a major probe on the IDF and defense establishment's general national security and defense concept related to Gaza and Hamas over the years will be presented by key officers to IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi already in early July, but will only be publicized to the public later in the summer after they are integrated with other issues.\n\nDetails of the probe\n\nThis probe will look all the way back to 2018, but not earlier.\n\nThe IDF said that it expected that as part of an eventual state inquiry and eventual State Comptroller report, such probes might look further back in time, but that if the IDF had gone back further than 2018, it would have also meant delaying publicizing the results to the public.\n\nFurther, the IDF said that it would be problematic to delay explaining what happened on October 7, including the failure to prevent Hamas's invasion, much past this point, given that by August already 10 months will have passed.\n\nThe first probes which will be publicized will likely be in mid-July, with the probe of the invasion and battle for the Gaza border village of Beeri potentially being the first.\n\nIDF Maj. Gen.

Its first goal was to secure the Philadelphi Corridor along the border with Egypt. This was accomplished within three weeks. Now, the IDF is fanning out into Rafah city, its environs, and its neighborhoods, and when this operation is finished, there will be a large question mark regarding what will come next.\n\nIDF chief spokesman R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari hinted at the existing challenges in an interview he gave to Channel 13 News on Wednesday. \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, we will only have Hamas in the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Chief of Staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, said something similar last month: \"We are now operating once again in Jabalya. As long as there is no diplomatic process to develop a governing body in the enclave that isn't Hamas, we'll have to launch campaigns again and again in other places to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure. It will be a Sisyphean task.\" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former war cabinet minister Benny Gantz have both called for a day-after strategy for Gaza.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThe battle of Rafah will end, perhaps even by the end of the month, which will pave the way for this monstrous question demanding a viable answer. If the IDF chooses to withdraw from the urban areas of Rafah, Israel will be left in control of two corridors in Gaza - Netzarim and Philadelphi. These were both seen as strategic and important areas to control when Israel managed Gaza from 1967 to 2005. So Jerusalem is replicating some of the methods it has used in the past; there is no reason to reinvent the wheel in Gaza.\n\nBut Israel doesn't want to govern the cities of Gaza the way it did in the 1970s and 1980s. It also doesn't want to end the war and leave completely. Some have suggested that it conduct a policy similar to the one in the northern West Bank, using raids to keep the terrorists in check.\n\nIsrael has apparently abandoned the policies that its leaders floated at the outset of the war, such as \"Hamas is ISIS\" and \"Hamas will be no more.\" These talking points would have called for replacing Hamas. It has also abandoned the idea of \"bubbles\" in Gaza, where local authorities would be given control. Further, it is unclear if Israel is even interested in a force in Gaza that would be backed by Arab states.\n\nThis leaves many questions as to what comes next. If there is no ceasefire and the IDF continues to control parts of Gaza, or even if there is a ceasefire and the IDF maintains some control, what will happen? It does not seem that Hamas will be defeated.\n\nThe security cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has defined the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war. The Prime Minister's Office reiterated this on Wednesday. Still, the terms \"military and governing capabilities\" are quite broad. Because of that, there are many junctures along the way, and in the future, Israel will be able to claim \"mission accomplished.\" But that won't necessarily mean that Hamas has been defeated.\n\nAnd, once Rafah is figured out, questions will loom about central Gaza. Israel has never fully operated in El-Bureij, Nuseirat, Deir el-Balah, or Maghazi, as Hamas's control there was deep, and it continues to be a threat.\n\nFor instance, the raid into the Nuseirat refugee camp to free four hostages this month illustrated how the area is teeming with terrorists. It has always been a major recruiting ground for Hamas. Indeed, as has already been exposed, many men from Nuseirat played a role in the October 7 massacre. Therefore, these areas in central Gaza, known as the \"central camps\" because they grew out of refugee camps established in the 1950s, clearly represent Hamas's home turf.\n\nThere are also concerns that Hamas members left Rafah and went back to Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Additionally, some of them may have relocated to the humanitarian area of Al-Mawasi. Rocket fire from Gaza has increased slightly in the last few weeks, illustrating that terrorists continue to possess 107mm rockets as well as mortars and other weapons, such as the Yasin 105 rocket and RPGs. It will be hard to declare victory in Gaza as long as rocket or mortar fire continues to be directed toward Israel's border communities.\n\nIf the IDF chooses to reenter northern Gaza, going into areas it has already operated in, like Beit Hanun, Shati, Zeitun, or Shejaia, this will raise questions regarding Hamas's ability to rebuild its networks quickly.\n\nIf the IDF goes back into Khan Yunis, this will raise similar doubts. All of this will point to how this war may be conducted in the future. Will it continue to use the sandpaper doctrine of slowly grinding down Hamas with each pass the IDF makes over these areas? If so, is there an objective, or merely diminishing returns in terms of what is found each time this happens again?", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"},

Netanyahu did not present such goals, because destroying Hamas is not a goal or a strategy.\"\n\nHe continued by saying the main issue the IDF is thought to have is what happens after the war in Gaza ends.\n\nMr Brom claimed a \"lack of strategy\" is frustrating the senior IDF leadership.\n\nHe added: \"From a military perspective they feel they have very good achievements, but it is going to waste because there is no strategy for after the war.\n\n\"Certainly, I think senior IDF leadership are frustrated with the lack of strategy. They are afraid that all of their military achievements will be wasted.\"\n\nIsrael launched its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas' October 7 attack, where 1,200 were killed.\n\nThe terrorists broke into the strip and attacked Kibbutzim in the south.\n\nIsrael responded with a set of systematic strikes that have dismantled much of Hamas' military infrastructure.\n\nDespite the elimination of many Hamas thugs, Israel is facing increasing international pressure to reach a ceasefire deal.\n\nWith the death toll in Gaza now passing 37,000, say Gaza Health Ministry figures.\n\nNetanyahu has been battling to stay in power for the last few months after a Channel 12 poll found that just 32 per cent of Israelis approve of the country's leadership.\n\nMuch of the criticism levelled at the PM has come from the families of the hostages still being held in Gaza.\n\nPeople have been constantly pleading for a ceasefire to be arranged so the remaining hostages can be brought home.\n\nIn May, an IDF reservist posted a shock video addressing Netanyahu directly.\n\nThey warned of a potential mutiny if Gaza was allowed to return to any form of Palestinian leadership.\n\nThe reservist was later relieved of his duties.\n\nHamas is not the only Middle Eastern enemy of Israel with the terror group Hezbollah causing serious issues for the PM.\n\nThe Iran-backed militia based in Lebanon has exchanged rocket fire with the Israelis for months.\n\nIsraeli reports are now suggesting the IDF may launch an offensive in Lebanon in the coming months.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has said a decision is coming soon on the attack plans.\n\nKatz posted on X: \"We are getting very close to the moment of deciding on changing the rules of the game against Hezbollah and Lebanon.\"\n\nDespite a looming set of strikes looking all but certain, Mr Brom warned that the IDF will likely fail with their attacks.\n\nHe has labelled Hezbollah as a much tougher opponent than Hamas has been.\n\nThe Hezbollah army is widely seen as a more well-trained and experienced group with an abundance of rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles.\n\nThe ex-IDF commander said: \"I don't think Israel can achieve their military objectives in Lebanon whatever they are.\n\n\"We cannot stop the rockets. The maximum I think is possible is to capture the south of Lebanon.\n\n\"But that won't stop the launch of rockets and drones into Israel.\"\n\nMr Brom added that Hezbollah could possibly overwhelm Israel's famed Iron Dome by firing thousands of rockets into the country at once.\n\nHe continued: \"Another big problem is the question of whether the Israeli defence system can engage against the large number of drones and rockets that could be fired.\n\n\"When Iran launched 300 projectiles, we dealt with it. But, because of the proximity, Hezbollah can fire maybe thousands of rockets.\n\n\"That is a very strong challenge.\"\n\nIt comes as Israel blasted a \"repugnant\" United Nations report claiming they had killed more than a dozen of its own people during the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe UN claims Israeli armed forces activated the \"Hannibal Directive\" which backs killing its soldiers to prevent them from becoming hostages.\n\nThe Israeli government angrily rejected the overall report, slamming the commission as \"biased and tainted by a distinct anti-Israeli agenda\".\n\nIt went on to note that it ignored Hamas's sadistic use of civilians as human shields.\n\nThe report \"describes an alternate reality in which decades of terrorist attacks have been erased\", it said.\n\n\"There are no continuous missile attacks on Israeli citizens and there isn't a democratic state defending itself against a terrorist assault.\"\n\nIsraeli forces have been on a rescue mission in recent weeks trying to save hostages still trapped in Gaza.\n\nHeart-racing footage showed the moment Israeli troops stormed into a living room and into a darkened bedroom where they found three men sheltering together.\n\nThe daring mission carried out on Saturday saw Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) rescue Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40.\n\nNoa Argamani, the 26-year-old woman whose story made headlines in October after she was snatched by Hamas, was also saved on Saturday from a nearby site.\n\nA hail of gunfire can be heard in the video as IDF troops smash open the apartment door, along with what appears to be children shouting and screaming in the background.\n\nShlomi, lying on a bed, holds his hands above his head in the footage as troops storm into the dark bedroom.",

Likewise, building materials should focus on withstanding attacks over looks.\n\nIn addition, he said that it might be ill-advised to have elderly people over the age of 70 living in such areas, given their additional vulnerabilities and the difficulty of evacuating them in the face of conflict.\n\nRather, he said that border villages must be thought of in the way that founding prime minister David Ben Gurion thought of them: the first line of Israel's national defense, and even a security zone of sorts.\n\nHe said it was crucial that all residents maintain up to date training for being part of an initial neighborhood defense team.\n\nFormer IDF generals state their views\n\nHowever, former IDF major general Yaakov Banjo disagreed.\n\nHe said that invasion was only one of many threats faced by border villages, including drone, rocket, anti-tank missiles attacks, and others.\n\nBanjo said that only the IDF had the capacity and technology to provide defense against most border threats.\n\nAlso, he pointed out that in this new era when far off countries like Yemen are firing ballistic missiles against Eilat, any part of Israel is vulnerable in a way that they were not before - and the focus should be on threats at that higher level.\n\nLikewise, former IDF major general Mickey Edelstein, who is also leading the IDF's probe of the battle of Beeri, said that it was unrealistic to put too much emphasis on neighborhood defense.\n\nHe pointed out that large numbers of residents on the Gaza border took the train daily to jobs in the Tel Aviv area, such that at most hours, they would not even be home to defend against an invasion.\n\nInstead, he said that the IDF must more robustly express its power to its nearby adversaries to improve its deterrence.\n\nHis point was that if Israel's deterrence and the IDF's border readiness had remained at a higher level, that Hamas would not have attacked\n\nThrowing this view for a curveball, former Knesset MK and INSS security expert Ofer Shelach pointed out that there are always limits on how aggressive the IDF can be with initiating preemptive attacks on its adversaries due to its need for global legitimacy.\n\nIn fact, Shelach pointed out that Israel's current global legitimacy is currently at a decades-long low, such that its ability to launch preemptive strikes in the future to maintain deterrence may be even more limited.\n\nMeanwhile, former IDF brigadier general Gil Shvartzman said that anyone living in a border village, whether in the North or the South, should have been on notice since rockets started being fired in 1999, that they are living in a danger zone.\n\nHe said there are patriotic aspects to living in these areas, and that residents should be ready to defend themselves and have proper safes in their homes to protect their weapons from being seized by potential enemy invaders.\n\nFurther, he said that villages who had their weapons protected on balance held off Hamas somewhat better than those which did not.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Monday, an explosion in Rafah claimed the lives of eight IDF soldiers, marking the deadliest single incident in the past six months, a figure that has significantly impacted Israeli public sentiment.\n\nJust a week prior, Hamas claimed responsibility for killing an unspecified number of Israeli soldiers with a booby-trapped house in the same region.\n\nIDF's chief, Herzi Halevi, has openly expressed concerns about the dwindling troop numbers, suggesting it could hinder Israel's capability to maintain the intensity of its operations against Hamas.\n\nThe army's challenges are compounded by internal political strife. Reports indicate significant friction between the military leadership and Netanyahu, particularly over the military's proposal to implement daily tactical pauses in fighting to allow for humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\nDomestically, the Israeli public is increasingly dismayed by the Palestinian casualties resulting from the conflict, leading to protests in Jerusalem against the government's strategy in Gaza.\n\n\"The IDF is totally exhausted after more than eight months of conflict,\" noted Ahron Bregman, a political scientist at King's College London. He highlighted the urgent need for the military to regroup, a sentiment echoed by the defense sector.\n\nThe conflict's duration and intensity have stretched the IDF's capabilities. \"We are observing sooner-than-expected rotations of brigades and battalions,\" stated Steven Wagner, a historian at Brunel University London, indicating a need for more frequent rest periods for troops.\n\nExperts argue that the IDF was unprepared for the scale of the conflict initiated on October 7. Over the past two decades, the Israeli military has significantly downsized, disbanding six divisions in anticipation of a shift away from large-scale regional wars. According to Bregman, the IDF currently lacks approximately two divisions, or 10,000 soldiers, necessary for sustained operations.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herzi Halevi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunel_University_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brunel University London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's College London"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666183", "eventUri": "eng-9666183", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2075, "textEnd": 2084}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

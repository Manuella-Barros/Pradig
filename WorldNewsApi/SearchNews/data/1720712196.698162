After former President Donald Trump and Republican campaign committees saw a windfall of donations after the guilty verdict came down, the GOP base is enlivened and that\u2019s only emboldening rank-and-file Republicans who are feeling bullish. \u201cI think it\u2019s bulls\u2014,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Raw Story of the guilty verdict. \u201cIt\u2019d be seen as election interference on steroids.\u201d ALSO READ: How Donald Trump could run for president \u2014 and lead the nation \u2014 from prison Others are predicting political retribution to come for Democrats if Trump\u2019s locked up, as one rumored GOP vice presidential contender told Raw Story. \u201cI think it would blow up the country,\u201d Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) told Raw Story at the Capitol this week. In these unprecedented, post-verdict times \u2014 mere days after the former president was found guilty on 34 felony counts by a jury of his New York neighbors \u2014 some on the formerly fringe-right are calling for the GOP to officially coronate Trump the Republican presidential nominee prior to the party\u2019s scheduled national convention in mid-July, before the earliest time Trump could be sentenced to time in the slammer or otherwise placed in detention. But of the 10 Republican lawmakers Raw Story exclusively interviewed this week, most are practically giddy about Trump\u2019s post-conviction prospects regardless of whether the would-be leader of the free world himself remains a free man. That\u2019s a lot of money Much of this enthusiasm revolves around money: The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee said they raised a combined $141 million in May \u2014 a figure that must formally be reported to the Federal Election Commission later this month. It\u2019s a staggering figure that nearly doubles Team Trump\u2019s previous high fundraising mark this cycle. While some Republicans are nervous about the prospects of what\u2019s just over the horizon, most Republicans are confident publicly and say Trump would be an effective GOP standard bearer whether behind bars or, say, on house arrest. To Republicans, the entire trial was tainted from its inception, thus any sentence handed down is also necessarily tainted. \u201cJust further confirms the level of corruption,\u201d Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) told Raw Story of the trial. ALSO READ: 'Most powerful thing': Witness details Trump's last moments before 'shocking' verdict \u201cBut do you think he'd be effective as the GOP nominee?\u201d Raw Story asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt shouldn't occur. And people really need to focus: If it can happen to a former president, every American citizen \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 is at risk.\u201d Talking points aside, even as Trump\u2019s lawyers appeal the verdict, the reality TV star-turned-politician is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. If the judge decides to lock Trump up, Graham thinks Trump\u2019s base will erupt, again. \u201cI don't know how much more of a boon they can get. I talked to \u2018em this morning,\u201d Graham told Raw Story at the Capitol. \u201cThey can't count the money fast enough. The reaction in terms of financial support has been beyond anybody's imagination. I think if they continue to trend in the eyes of millions of Americans using the New York case to interfere with the election, you know, it only gets more support for Donald Trump.\u201d The head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), has seen a massive spike in donations since the verdict. He predicts a similar response if Trump\u2019s jailed in New York, because he says it would turn Trump into a martyr for the MAGA cause. \u201cHis fundraising will explode, even more so. And I think they'll see this as a political prisoner,\u201d Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) told Raw Story. \u201cIt's awful. Trump probably had a better chance getting a fair trial in Honduras.\u201d Nevermind that Honduras\u2019 former president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, was convicted in Manhattan Federal Court this March \u2014 on cocaine smuggling and weapons charges. Desperate times, desperate convention? Shortly after the guilty verdict reverberated across the globe last Thursday, the MAGA wing of Trump\u2019s base started calling \u2014 some say, conspiratorially so \u2014 for the GOP to move the party\u2019s scheduled convention up. The convention is scheduled for July 15 to July 18 in Milwaukee, Wis.,, afterall, and the sentencing is scheduled for July 11. Coincidence? Never. New conspiracy? Always. Republicans in Congress were quick to follow their followers, even if altering the convention\u2019s timing would be a logistical nightmare. \u201cConsider moving the convention. Don't let that get messed up by virtue of that,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) told Raw Story. \u201cLike, move it up. And whether that's in Milwaukee or whether you do a sort of an informal \u2014 or a different kind of convention \u2014 to get the nomination knocked out before that occurs.\u201d Roy says it would send an important message. \u201cIt sends a signal that the party\u2019s resolved,\u201d Roy said. \u201cLook, I've been very public in my differences with the [former] president on different things. This is a republic. This is where we are. He's the nominee of the Republican Party for president of the United States. He's been targeted in a ridiculous politically motivated personal prosecution.\u201d The Republican drumbeat is deafening. Nobody knows what Merchan will do. In fact, because Trump\u2019s never been convicted before and because he\u2019s not charged with a violent crime, some prominent legal minds don\u2019t expect any jail time \u2014 perhaps probation, a fine, community service, even nothing at all. Trump has also vowed to appeal his conviction, and the appeals process could take months. You wouldn\u2019t know that from talking to rank-and-file Republicans, though. \u201cThey are gonna do it, and he will get the biggest, have another big fundraising haul,\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) told Raw Story. \u201cAmerican people sense what's going on, and they're furious. And it'll just incite them more to take up for Trump, and you're seeing it already.\u201d One of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s top lieutenants, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), agrees. \u201cI think people are awake,\u201d Cornyn \u2014 who\u2019s running to replace McConnell as GOP leader \u2014- told Raw Story. \u201cThere's been so many abuses \u2014 that would just be the icing on the cake.\u201d Those GOP talking points have now, seemingly, become a part of the party\u2019s DNA. Republican retribution on horizon? Republicans aren\u2019t going to forget that Trump was convicted in a blue state, regardless of whether it\u2019s the former president\u2019s home state \u2014 a state Trump recently said he could win in 2024. If the GOP standard-bearer is jailed, then we should all brace for a new low in today\u2019s gutter politics. \u201cIt would be next level, man,\u201d Vance of Ohio told Raw Story. \u201cThis is going to come back around, right? Eventually Republicans are going to have power, and I guarantee there are going to be really strong pressures to use this new precedent in a way that's going to harm Democrats.\u201d Republican rhetoric leaves no wiggle room: If Trump is jailed, the conservative messaging machine is going to unleash an unrelenting barrage of accusations that the prosecutions are all politics \u2014 jurors and their independent verdicts be damned. \u201cIf there were, of course, a house arrest, it would be very transparently taken as a way to keep former President Trump off the campaign trail and a way to try to get Biden reelected through election interference as opposed to through our legitimate processes,\u201d Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) told Raw Story. \u201cThe same would be true with a jail sentence. Most people can't even figure out what crime former President Trump was convicted of. So it just looks like such a sham.\u201d \u2018Let's not be distracted\u2019 While Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) agrees that a Trump imprisonment would mean the former president would \u201craise more money and more likely win the election,\u201d he\u2019s also cautioning his fellow party members against focusing on the trials, tribulations and tumults of Trump. \u201cWe should not take the bait and shift their focus away from the failure of [the Biden administration] on the economy, on the border, on global leadership,\u201d Tillis told Raw Story at the Capitol this week. \u201cLet's not be distracted and say, \u2018poor me.\u2019\u201d July 11 is just about a month away, but Tillis says it should be just another day to the GOP. \u201cI don't think he will be sentenced anytime \u2014 because that would, I just think, it's already mind blowing what he's going through \u2014 but if he is, let\u2019s keep focusing on the thing that's gonna win November,\u201d Tillis said. Still other Republicans \u2014 even those who usually have an answer for everything \u2014 are mum. \u201cI don't want to answer hypotheticals,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) told Raw Story. \u201cI mean, this whole thing is just a travesty.\u201d NOW READ: Michael Cohen, Red Finch and the fateful moment Trump lost the jury", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=52360795&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=98%2C0%2C99%2C0\"/><br/><br/><p>WASHINGTON \u2014 Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are all but daring New York Judge Juan Merchan to lock Donald Trump up ahead of November.</p><p>After former President Donald Trump and Republican campaign committees saw a windfall of donations after the guilty verdict came down, the GOP base is enlivened and that\u2019s only emboldening rank-and-file Republicans who are feeling bullish. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s bulls\u2014,\u201d Sen.

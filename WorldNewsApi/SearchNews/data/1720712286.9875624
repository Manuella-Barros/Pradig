{"id": 231975098, "title": "Bayern Munich set to complete transfer Thomas Tuchel felt was behind his sacking", "text": "Bayern Munich are in talks to sign Fulham star Joao Palhinha in a deal that could even be completed before the start of Euro 2024. Reports suggest a \u00a338million deal could be struck that sees the Portugal midfielder make the move to the Allianz Arena before his side start their European Championship campaign against Czechia on June 18. The move comes less than a year on from Bayern's public, and failed attempt to land Palhinha last summer. The Fulham ace made the trip to Munich and completed his medical before waiting for the green light from the Cottagers to complete the deal on transfer deadline day in September. However, Marco Silva's side were unable to find a replacement and pulled the plug on the deal at the eleventh hour. Former Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel saw the absence of Palhinha's profile a key reason for his team's struggles as they finished third in the Bundesliga some 18 points behind winners Bayer Leverkusen. Die Roten's poor form saw the club's hierarchy agree to end Tuchel's tenure early, before their struggle to appoint a manager saw them try to tempt the German coach to stay. Reports claim one condition Tuchel required was to sign Palhinha this summer. Despite the former Chelsea boss ultimately not extending his stay, it appears Vincent Kompany was in aggreement with his predecessor over what Bayern lacked, and hopes to strenthen his midfield. The Bundesliga giants do not appear keen to allow a similar situation to occur as to what happened last summer. As a result, the move could be tied up soon. Palhinha extended his contract at Fulham until 2028 after his move collapsed, and Bayern did not return for his signature in January. Speaking last month, the Portugal international was coy when asked about his future. He continued: \u201cI don't know if it's a closed door or not, everything in football is very uncertain. I can't say it's a closed or open door. I can't put myself in a position like that either. \u201cToday I want to focus more on the European Championships because that's the goal, to leave a good impression at the Euros, and then everything else will follow. People already know me. \"The fact that I'm in the Premier League means I'm in a very big shop window, probably the biggest of them all. The Euros is also a showcase that everyone is following all over the world.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

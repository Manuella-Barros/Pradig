He lived up to the hype. On the other hand, as Vlasic entered his first full NHL season, no one was sure what to expect.\n\nA season later, the 22-year-old Vlasic opened their eyes with his ability to extinguish opponents' plays with his length, positioning and IQ. He did it against everyone, too. He became Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson's most trusted defenseman and matched up against the top lines at the highest rate.\n\nIn a recent poll, Blackhawks teammates voted Vlasic as one of the team's top players who doesn't receive enough credit, gushing about his potential, even as he received more league-wide respect.\n\nThe Blackhawks locked up that potential on Wednesday, as the team and Vlasic agreed to a six-year contract extension with a $4.6 million cap hit, a league source said. Vlasic's contract will expire after the 2029-30 season.\n\nVlasic, who grew up in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Ill., signed the first long-term contract of Kyle Davidson's tenure as Blackhawks general manager, becoming the first young player to be secured in Davidson's rebuild puzzle.\n\nVlasic said a long-term extension with his hometown team is a dream come true.\n\n\"I would love to be here as long as possible,\" Vlasic said after the season. \"It's amazing being able to play for my hometown team, the same city I grew up in, so I'm not really looking to go anywhere else. So yeah, I want to be here as long as possible, and (Davidson) knows that.\"\n\nVlasic's extension will also give him peace of mind as he travels to Czechia to play for Team USA in the World Championships next month. Without a contract, he had to look into an insurance policy in case he was injured while playing for his country.\n\nVlasic is excited to represent the U.S. again and put himself in the conversation for upcoming international events. The tournament is also an opportunity for him and fellow defenseman Seth Jones, who will also be playing for the U.S., to continue to build on their chemistry as the Blackhawks' No. 1 pairing.\n\nJones was among those blown away by Vlasic's season. Jones compared his experience playing with a young Zach Werenski on the Columbus Blue Jackets with playing with Vlasic now.\n\n\"Vlassy, playing with him all year, tremendous steps,\" Jones said after the season. \"I played with Werenski when he was 21, and they're different players, but you see the same stuff that you're seeing there -- I am personally. Vlassy is going to be a heck of a defenseman, and I had a lot of fun playing with him this year.\"\n\nNick Foligno, another Blackhawks team leader, had similar praise for Vlasic.\n\n\"I know we call it the 'Connor Bedard Era,' but I also call it the start of the 'Alex Vlasic Era,' too, and what he's done for our team already, and (Kevin) Korchinski,\" Foligno said after the season.\n\nVlasic's analytics put him in an elite defenseman category this season. Based on Evolving Hockey's model, Vlasic was first among all defensemen in overall defensive goals above replacement and second in even-strength defense. Vlasic also finished atop The Athletic's net rating model among all Blackhawks players.\n\n\"It was incredible from day one what he accomplished this year,\" Richardson said of Vlasic after the season. \"Being in a top pairing role with Seth, I think they really complement each other well. And with their range and with their reach, I think they really defended well. But both of them, at times, can get up the ice and add into the offense.\"\n\nRichardson is hopeful Vlasic can add more offense in the future, too. He had two goals and 14 assists in 76 games this season. He had a handful of breakaways that he couldn't convert.\n\n\"I know Vlassy was a little frustrated he didn't get more finish on his offense, but that'll come,\" Richardson said. \"I thought he started shooting the puck better at the end of the year and he's going to get one of those shorthanded breakaways one of these times. But with the composure that he played with and just the skating ability, laterally, he just stole pucks all over the place and turned them into line rushes for. It was incredible to see. And he's just 22. Right now he's going to start to fill out because he's so long and rangy. If he keeps that skating and lateral skating ability and mobility and puts on another 10, 15 pounds of solid muscle and strength, he's going to be a hard man to play against, for sure.\"\n\nAnd now, Vlasic is ensured he'll do that with the Blackhawks.\n\nRequired reading", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_powers@theathletic.com", "name": "Scott Powers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Jones_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seth Jones (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Vlasic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Vlasic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Davidson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmette,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmette, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmette, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Werenski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Werenski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice Hockey World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Bedard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Bedard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Foligno", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Foligno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foligno", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foligno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foligno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/04/25103409/USATSI_22392657_168393877_lowres-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513114", "eventUri": "eng-9513114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

He is coming off of his age 22 season, which was the first time that he got consistent playing time in the NHL.\n\nThis past season, Vlasic played in 76 games for the Blackhawks and put up two goals and 14 assists for 16 total points, according to Hockey Reference. Vlasic is more of a defensive defenseman, and is likely not someone who who will be known to contribute much on offense. However, the Blackhawks' roster was not very strong, so maybe as the roster improves, his point totals will go up.\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the Blackhawks have committed to Vlasic as one of their cornerstone players for the future, a group that is headlined by last summer's No. 1 pick in Connor Bedard.\n\nDespite having some young talent on the roster, the Blackhawks finished near the bottom of the league. Chicago had a 23-53-6 record this season, good for 52 points, which was only better than the San Jose Sharks, who finished with a 19-54-9 record and 47 points.\n\nDue to the bad year, the Blackhawks are very much in play for the No. 1 pick again in this year's NHL lottery. The franchise could end up picking anywhere between first and fourth overall. The odds for the No. 1 pick for the Blackhawks are at 13.5%, with No. 2 being set at 14.1%, No. 3 being at 30.7% and No. 4 being at 41.7%, according to Tankathon.\n\nWhat is the Blackhawks' plan for the future?\n\nThe Blackhawks are clearly trying to build a young core of players. As mentioned before, Connor Bedard is the centerpiece. He showed a lot of promise in his rookie year. Now, Vlasic is going to be a key player as well. As mentioned before, Vlasic is a true defensive defenseman. He does not bring much from an offensive standpoint, but that does not mean he is not a valuable player for the franchise.\n\nWhen it comes to the advanced metrics, Vlasic grades out incredibly well defensively. It is harder to evaluate defense in hockey, because you can not simply just look at point totals. Still, those who know advanced hockey metrics believe this is a good value contract for the Blackhawks.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Vlasic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Vlasic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Blackhawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Bedard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor Bedard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Jose Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chicago-makes-4.6-million-Alex-Vlasic-move-to-kick-off-offseason.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513114", "eventUri": "eng-9513114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The team had a rough season, securing a 23-53-6 record despite high expectations for signing Connor Bedard.\n\nDespite the Blackhawks season full of tests and trials, Alex Vlasic gained the organization's confidence. His contract carries a $4.6 million cap hit for the next six years. His six-year extension with Chicago includes a 10-team no-trade list in Years 5 and 6.\n\nVlasic's journey from a promising prospect to a cornerstone of the Blackhawks' defense has been impressive. At just 22, he has proven he is a reliable defenseman.\n\nVlasic has been productive on the defensive front in the past season. He tallied two goals, 14 assists, 56 hits and 148 blocked shots in 76 games. He has consistently confronted opponents' top lines and forged a formidable partnership with Seth Jones on the No. 1 defensive pairing.\n\nVlasic wanted to sign with his hometown team for the long term and has finally done it.\n\n\"I would love to be here as long as possible,\" Vlasic said, via The Athletic. \"It's amazing being able to play for my hometown team, the same city I grew up in, so I'm not really looking to go anywhere else. So yeah, I want to be here as long as possible, and (Davidson) knows that.\"\n\nConnor Bedard, Alex Vlasic among others could help the Blackhawks' future\n\nSo, what will be the Chicago Blackhawks' plan? For now, their evaluation hinges on their ongoing rebuild progress and the development of promising young players.\n\nDespite a dismal offensive performance, Connor Bedard's 22 goals and 61 points and Philipp Kurashev's 18 goals and 54 points give the team hope.\n\nDespite finishing last in goals scored, Bedard's emergence is a beacon of promise amidst the team's struggles. While the overall team performance didn't exceed expectations, it didn't fall below them, earning them a modest C grade.\n\nWith Bedard and Kurashev leading the charge, the Blackhawks could become formidable contenders as they continue to rebuild.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ankit_kumar@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ankit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Vlasic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Vlasic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Bedard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor Bedard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Blackhawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Jones_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Jones (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Kurashev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philipp Kurashev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/23044188-1714058443.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513114", "eventUri": "eng-9513114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

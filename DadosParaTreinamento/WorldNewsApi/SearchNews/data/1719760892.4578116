It came as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \u201cno decision has been taken\u201d to ban her from standing, leaving open the possibility that she could still be their candidate on July 4. Asked about the matter on Wednesday, Mr Khan said he could not be sure what to believe from the media\u2019s reporting of the issue - and he had not spoken to Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) to get a definitive version of events. Ms Abbott had told the Evening Standard on Wednesday morning that reports of her being banned from re-standing were \u201ctrue\u201d. In a statement to broadcasters - reported in the Guardian - she was even more categorical, saying: \u201cAlthough the whip has been restored, I am banned for standing as a Labour candidate.\u201d Sir Keir told the BBC later on Wednesday that this was \u201cnot true\u201d, saying: \u201cThe process that we were going through ended with the restoration of the whip the other day, so she\u2019s a member of the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] and no decision has been taken barring her\u201d. Mr Khan also suggested the matter may not yet have been settled, though he did not claim to have any special insight into the case. \u201cAll I know about Diane\u2019s case is what I\u2019ve seen in the media,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the media, it says that Diane\u2019s been restored the whip, but also it says in the media that the NEC hasn\u2019t decided yet what happens in relation to Diane.\u201d Labour withdrew the whip in April 2023 from the veteran MP after she wrote in the Observer newspaper that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experienced prejudice, but not racism all their lives. She apologised and withdrew the remarks shortly afterwards. BBC Newsnight reported that Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) had written to Ms Abbott in December 2023 to say it had concluded an inquiry into her comments and given her a formal warning over them. According to Newsnight, the MP was required to complete an \"antisemitism awareness course\", which she did in February. It was then revealed that the whip was restored to her on Tuesday. Asked whether it would be fair for her now to be banned from standing, given that she is said to have done what was asked of her by Labour, the mayor said: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hypotheticals. I\u2019m not going to comment on hypotheticals.\u201d Asked about Ms Abbott\u2019s claim to journalists that she has been barred, Mr Khan said: \u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to the NEC about the position. But the NEC, and the media, are saying no position has been taken. \u201cSo you can cherrypick quotes from the media, but you\u2019re reinforcing my point about [how] all I know is what I\u2019ve seen in the media.\u201d He also told the Standard: \u201cWhat I know, as someone who\u2019s known Diane well since 2005, is she\u2019s a trailblazer. I remember as a 16-year-old boy seeing her elected in 1987, with Bernie Grant, Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz. It made a huge impact on me. \u201cI must be one of millions of people on whom she made a huge impact - in a positive sense of the word.\u201d He added: \u201cShe\u2019s been a mentor to many of us, but also she\u2019s stood up on issues that aren\u2019t very popular - the issues around racial justice, social justice, highlighting some of the discrimination when it comes to stop and search, when it comes to the exclusion of black boys from school, when it comes to the NHS. \u201cSo I think she\u2019s somebody who\u2019s done a huge amount for Hackney, for London, for our country, and so I think it\u2019s really important that she\u2019s given the respect she deserves.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The mayor refused to say whether it would be fair for the party to ban her from re-standing, as it was a \u2018hyphothetical\u2019 question</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/diane-abbott-labour-candidate-hackney-north-general-election-whip-barred-keir-starmer-sadiq-khan-b1160817.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/04/24/11/4d8fb0817550ea664f18256209bd715eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjgyNDE3OTMx-2.71871313.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LdjOWrQu-BqwSYW3q.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:18:08", "author": "Noah Vickers", "authors": ["Noah Vickers"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.033}

The once-bustling hillside village in Enga province was almost completely obliterated when the landslide struck in the early hours of Friday morning, burying scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them. \u201cThere are an estimated 150-plus houses now buried,\u201d said UN migration agency representative Serhan Aktoprak, adding that \u201c670-plus people are assumed dead\u201d. \u201cThe situation is terrible with the land still sliding. The water is running and this is creating a massive risk for everyone involved,\u201d added Aktoprak, who oversees teams of emergency workers from Port Moresby. The unforgiving terrain, damaged roads and an outbreak of tribal violence nearby have seriously hamstrung efforts to get help into the disaster zone. More than two days after the landslide rumbled down the face of Mount Mungalo, mud-caked villagers in bare feet are still searching for their loved ones using shovels, axes and other makeshift tools. Disaster worker Omer Mohamud arrived at the site on Sunday, finding deeply \u201ctraumatised\u201d villagers using \u201csticks and spades to discover the trapped bodies\u201d. \u201cThe situation is really horrible, people are in shock and traumatised,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cThe land is still sliding. You can see rocks falling down from the mountain.\u201d More than 1,000 people have been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies estimated, with food gardens and water supplies almost completely wiped out. Aid agencies and local leaders initially feared between 100 to 300 people had perished underneath the mud and rubble spanning almost four football fields in length. But the death toll grew after local leaders and disaster workers realised official figures underestimated the population, Aktoprak said. Five bodies and the leg of a sixth had been pulled from the debris by Saturday night. This number is expected to start climbing in the coming days as diggers and other heavy machinery speed up the painstaking excavations. \u201cThe destruction is massive,\u201d Nickson Pakea, president of the nearby Porgera Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told AFP on Saturday. \u201cThey need machinery and other equipment to uncover these bodies. We are facing a big problem.\u201d Located on the side of densely forested Mount Mungalo, the village was home to a transient population that could swell to more than 4,000 people. It served as a trading post for miners who panned for gold in the highlands. \u201cIt\u2019s a centre of the community. People come from near and far to do their alluvial mining, and then they come to this place to trade,\u201d Pakea said. A difficult journey to make at the best of times, vehicle access has been further complicated by a burst of tribal violence along the only route not blocked by the slip. Aktoprak said the violence was \u201cnot related to the landslide\u201d. Papua New Guinea\u2019s military had stepped in to provide a \u201csecurity escort\u201d to aid convoys, he added. French President Emmanuel Macron said his country was \u201cready to contribute to relief and reconstruction efforts\u201d, posting on social media platform X two days after US President Joe Biden expressed a similar willingness to help. In a statement, Biden said he and First Lady Jill Biden were \u201cheartbroken by the loss of life and devastation\u201d. At some points, the landslide \u2014 a mix of car-sized boulders, uprooted trees and churned-up earth \u2014 was thought to be eight metres (26 feet) deep. Locals said it may have been triggered by heavy rains that have saturated the region in recent weeks. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, according to the World Bank, with the heaviest downpours concentrated in the country\u2019s humid highland interior. Research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. This year has seen intense rainfall and flooding across Papua New Guinea.

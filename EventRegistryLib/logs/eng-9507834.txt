Three soldiers, a cyclist and horses were hurt and vehicles damaged after chaos broke out during rush hour.\n\nTwo horses were seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said the horses from the Household Cavalry were being exercised ahead of an inspection due to take place tomorrow in Hyde Park.\n\nDuring the exercise, the horses were \"spooked\" by nearby building works. Four soldiers were thrown from their saddles and five horses ran loose through London.\n\nIn a statement Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment Matt Woodward said: \"Every morning, the Household Cavalry Mounted regiment in London exercises some 150 horses in the parks and on the roads.\n\n\"This keeps them fit and helps inoculate them to city noise so they're less easily panicked on parades.\n\n\"This morning, however, a small group of horses were spooked by some construction works on a quiet side road in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them. The ensuing shock caused all horses to bolt and unseated some riders. \"Our immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of our soldiers, members of the public and our horses.\"\n\n\"Three of our soldiers have incurred injuries which are not deemed to be life-threatening and they're receiving treatment in hospital, while our horses have all returned to Hyde Park barracks and are undergoing veterinary care.\n\n\"Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare, we continue to strive to minimise the risk of this recurring.\"\n\nA taxi driver waiting outside the Clermont Hotel in Buckingham Palace Road had the windows of his car smashed after a spooked horse collided with the Mercedes people carrier. A horse also crashed into a parked double-decker tour bus, smashing the windscreen.\n\nOne eyewitness told ITV News he saw five horses running along the street \"like crazy\", adding: \"One of them crashed into the bus - they ran like crazy!\n\n\"One guy (was hit) and the ambulance came. One of the horses was white and covered in blood.\n\n\"People were scared and ran away.\"\n\nAnother eyewitness, Daniele Torrisi added: \"My colleague heard a bang then I looked outside and saw this horse bleeding and the bus was cracked - so the horse hit the bus.\n\n(The horse) was bleeding quite badly. You could see people around trying to calm him down - he was a bit agitated.\"\n\nAn Army spokesperson said: \"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning. \"All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp. A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"\n\nPictures and videos of two of the animals running amok around London were shared on social media, one of which showed a black 4\u00d74 with blue lights following two of the animals between Tower Bridge and Limehouse tunnel.\n\nA worker for tour bus company, Big Bus, Mr Mahmood, said three horses got \"out of control\" from Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nHe said: \"One of the horses bumped into a bus, then everything got out of control.\n\n\"I saw two horses without riders gallop away. One rider managed to calm his horse down.\n\n\"An ambulance went to assist another rider who had been injured.\"\n\nTwo horses were captured by officers from the City of London Police.\n\nThe force said on X: \"At around 8.40am, we were called about horses that had became loose and were travelling through the City. \"Our officers have contained two horses on the highway near Limehouse. We're waiting for an Army horse box to collect the horses and transport them to veterinary care.\"\n\nThe London Ambulance Service said it was called at 8.25am to reports of a person being thrown from a horse in Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We were called at 8:25am today (April 24) to reports of a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road, SW1W.\n\n\"We sent resources to the scene including ambulance crews, a paramedic in a fast response car, and an incident response officer.\n\n\"Our first paramedic was on the scene in five minutes.", "source": {"uri":

The Army said they were undergoing veterinary care.\n\nAn army spokesperson told the BBC that three soldiers were receiving treatment for non-life threatening injuries. The fourth person injured in the incident is believed to be a cyclist and member of the public.\n\nThe chaos began while members of the Household Cavalry - members of the military who carry out ceremonial duties around Buckingham Palace - were taking part in a rehearsal for a Major General's Inspection - which was due to take place on Thursday in Hyde Park, the Army told the BBC.\n\nEvery military unit taking part in the King's birthday parade, which takes place in June, must pass a Major General's Inspection in advance. An Army spokesman said the group included six soldiers and seven horses. Four soldiers were thrown from their saddles, and five horses ran loose through London.\n\nLt Col Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said: \"Building materials were dropped from height right next to\n\nthem.\n\n\"The ensuing shock caused all horses to bolt and unseated some riders.\"\n\nHe expressed \"heartfelt gratitude\" to the emergency services and the public who helped in securing the horses.\n\nOne serviceman was thrown from his horse on Buckingham Palace Road, before one of the loose animals collided with a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering the windows.\n\nLondon Ambulance Service said four people were treated by paramedics in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and the junction between Chancery Lane and Fleet Street. All four were taken to hospital.\n\nIt said all three incidents took place within 10 minutes, between 8:25am and 8:35am.\n\nAn Army spokesperson added: \"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning.\n\n\"All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp. A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"\n\nGrace Whitaker, 23, told the BBC she had just got off a bus on her way to work when she saw several emergency services vehicles near Victoria Station.\n\n\"I saw about five fire engines, six ambulances,\" she said. \"I saw one of the horses that was involved, saw some members of the army. It was quite the scene with lots of emergency services around, putting up cordons.\"\n\n\"One of the black horses was there. I thought maybe it was a police horse that had come to attend to the scene but obviously I now know it was one of the horses that had escaped.\n\n\"I saw what looked like a taxi van that had damage to it, a smashed window. I think everyone's immediate impression was that somebody had been hit by a car. We were quite surprised when we realised it was to do with horses.\"\n\nWhitaker added that she witnessed at least one person being treated for injuries.\n\n\"There was a blue tent around what I assume was an injured person.\"\n\nMegan Morra told the BBC she was walking to work when she saw police officers \"running through the street\", and another walking a \"very bloody\" black horse down the path.\n\nShe said the horse appeared to be suffering from a large head injury.\n\n\"There was a lot of blood,\" she says. \"I was a bit distressed to be honest, looking at the poor horse.\"\n\nBlack cab driver Robbie told BBC Radio London he narrowly avoided being hit by the horses.\n\nHe said: \"I was just outside Buckingham Palace on the Mall and heard loads of galloping and looked behind and there were about three or four horses.\n\n\"Two of them were sprinting up towards Trafalgar Square and there was a white one covered in blood as well.\n\n\"I looked in the rear mirror and saw them coming right up behind me, and at the time I had two punters in the back so I was worried about them.\"\n\nInsp Myles Hilbery, of City of London Police, praised the two officers who helped catch the horses in Limehouse.\n\n\"Police constables Lucy Hawes and Daniel McKeown risked their own safety to provide first aid to the injured and anxious horses,\" he said.\n\n\"They kept the horses calm while waiting for a horse box and veterinary team to arrive.\"\n\nLondon Fire Brigade said it had used its drone team to help locate the animals.\n\nThe incident is unusual, as the horses of the Household Cavalry are specifically chosen by the army.\n\nAccording to forces.net, the horses are chosen for their height (at least 168cm) and strength as they need to be able to carry a soldier plus kit for a long period of time.\n\nThe horses are trained for several months and ridden on the streets of London to get used to heavy traffic and loud noises, including gun salutes and military bands.\n\nEach horse is usually assigned to one specific soldier.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They have all been recovered.\n\n\"Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition.\n\n\"Obviously we will be monitoring that condition. They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\"\n\nThe minister said the two injured cavalry horses are named Vida and Quaker.\n\nMr Cartlidge went on to say it was an \"exceptional\" situation, explaining more than 150 animals are on exercise in the capital each day.\n\nAsked about the condition of the two seriously injured horses by LBC, he said he \"wouldn't want to say more\".\n\nHe added: \"Obviously, we didn't want that situation to happen. What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional.\n\n\"You are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n\"So this is extremely unlikely this scenario. Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\n\nThe Army later said two horses involved had undergone operations.\n\nIn a statement on X, formerly Twitter, the Army said one of those operated on had been taken to equine hospital.\n\nThree soldiers who were injured would \"recover fully and return to duty\", it added.\n\nThe statement said: \"Of the seven horses which were spooked, five tried to bolt and four, Vida, Trojan, Quaker and Tennyson, broke loose.\n\n\"Two of the injured horses were operated on last night, with one transferred to an equine hospital. All remaining horses are being closely observed.\n\n\"Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course.\n\n\"We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses. We will provide more updates soon.\"\n\nPictures and videos of the horses were shared on social media, one of which showed a black 4x4 with blue lights following the animals.\n\nFootage posted by users showed a saddled white horse covered in blood running through the street alongside a black one.\n\nAmbulance crews treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10 minutes.\n\nIt is understood that three soldiers were assessed in hospital for their injuries, which were not thought to be serious.\n\nA City of London Police spokesperson also said yesterday: \"At around 8.40am, we were called about horses that had became loose and were travelling through the City.\n\n\"Our officers have contained two horses on the Highway near Limehouse.\n\n\"We're waiting for an Army horse box to collect the horses and transport them to veterinary care.\"\n\nThe Sun has

The incident occurred near Buckingham Palace during a routine exercise, with the horses spooked by construction noise. The Household Cavalry's horses were recovered and returned for medical attention. London Ambulance Service treated and transported the injured. Police officers assisted the horses and ensured public safety. The police praised their constables for providing first aid and guiding the horses to safety.\n\nFive riderless military horses that bolted during a routine exercise on Wednesday morning unleashed rush-hour mayhem on the streets of central London near Buckingham Palace, injuring at least four people.\n\nScenes of one blood-covered horse galloping along Aldwych near the High Commission of India and the West End theatre district were shared widely on social media after the horses collided with cars and smashed into a tourist bus.\n\nThe British Army later confirmed that all its horses had been recovered and returned to their camp, where they were receiving medical attention.\n\n''All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp. Several personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention,'' a spokesperson said.\n\nThe chaos is said to have erupted when the horses became alarmed by construction noise from builders working nearby.\n\nFive of the seven horses ran off from where the exercise was taking place in Belgravia, a posh neighbourhood to the west of Buckingham Palace -- the residence of King Charles III.\n\nThe ceremonial exercise was part of preparations for the monarch's annual birthday parade, known as Trooping the Colour, next month.\n\nAccording to reports, several soldiers were thrown off after the horses were spooked and three of the soldiers had to be taken to the hospital with injuries.\n\n\"We responded to several calls regarding an incident with horses on the loose in central London this morning. We sent multiple resources to the three scenes, treating four patients in total and taking them all to the hospital. We have since been stood down,\" a London Ambulance Service statement said.\n\nThe horses belonged to the Household Cavalry, which is the ceremonial guard of the British monarch and a regular feature of state functions in London.\n\nA taxi waiting near Buckingham Palace appeared to have a car window smashed in the mayhem, while a parked double-decker tourist bus had its windshield damaged.\n\n\"This was a dynamic incident and the courageous actions taken by police officers from our Roads Policing team prevented further harm and distress to the horses and members of the public,\" said Inspector Myles Hilbery from the City of London Police.\n\nHilbery praised his police constables who he said had risked their safety to provide first aid to the injured and anxious horses.\n\n\"They kept the horses calm while waiting for a horse box and veterinary team to arrive,\" he added.\n\nThe police force took control of the traffic, with officers on motorbikes creating a clear path for the horses to be safely led into the horse box and escorted back to the Army barracks for urgent medical care.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

They also responded to the scene of two collisions, \"including one near Victoria Railway Station where a horse was involved in a collision with a taxi.\"\n\nShortly before 10 a.m. local time, City of London police tweeted that officers had contained two horses on the highway near Limehouse -- which is in London's East End, about 6 miles away from Buckingham Palace -- and were waiting for the Army

It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day,\" he told LBC radio.\n\n\"So this is extremely unlikely, this scenario.\"\n\nLondon Ambulance Service said it was called at 8:25 am (0725 GMT) to reports of a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nTwo of the horses were recaptured by the City of London Police, which polices the Square Mile financial district.\n\nOfficers contained two animals while \"an army horse box had collected the horses and transported them to veterinary care\".\n\nThe driver of a Mercedes car told LBC radio he had been waiting outside a hotel in Buckingham Palace Road when he felt something smash into his car.\n\nHe said he saw three or four horses near the vehicle, and that an army rider had been thrown off and injured.\n\nOne horse crashed into a parked double-decker tour bus, smashing the windscreen.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [],

The powerful animals were scared when concrete was dropped by builders which landed next to them, causing four service personnel to be thrown from their steeds.\n\nFive of the animals got loose, smashing into vehicles and causing a number of injuries. They were seen running through busy areas of the city, one of them bloodied, before they were finally brought under control.\n\nIn an update on X, formerly Twitter, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said: \"This morning, a small group of horses were spooked by construction works on a quiet side road where building materials were dropped from height next to them.\n\nTwo of the horses spotted running through London\n\n\"The ensuing shock caused all horses to bolt and unseated some riders. Our immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of our soldiers, members of the public and our horses. Our horses have all returned to Hyde Park Barracks and are undergoing veterinary care. Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and number of horses involved this type of incident is extremely rare.\"\n\nThree soldiers were assessed in hospital for their injuries, which were not thought to be serious. A white horse collided with a Mercedes people carrier, leaving blood spattered down the side. Another of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windscreen. The animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel, before they were recaptured by City of London Police and taken away to be assessed by Army vets.\n\nOne of the horses collided with a bus in London\n\nIn a Tweet, the British Army said: \"Thank you to Met Police, City of London Police, London Ambulance Service, London Fire Brigade and members of the public for reacting as quickly as they did. This enabled the swift treatment of our soldiers and helped us to bring our injured horses to safety.\"\n\nWitness Tula, a management consultant from south London, said: \"I got off the 172 bus which ends at Aldwych and two horses went flying past. One black, one white. The white one was drenched in blood from the chest down and they were galloping through the traffic at speed.\n\n\"People were stopping in the street shocked. The horses were running into fast-moving traffic and seemed terrified. Some unmarked police cars were chasing after them, which didn't seem to be helping. I felt shocked. It was pretty gruesome. Felt like a weird dream.\"\n\nWhere the horses were spotted in London\n\nA London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called at 8:25am today (April 24) to reports of a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road, SW1W. We sent resources to the scene including ambulance crews, a paramedic in a fast-response car, and an incident response officer.

They were among five Household Cavalry horses that went on a six-mile rampage and left four people injured. One of the horses - named as Vida - was seen soaked in blood as it galloped through central London, alongside a black horse, called Quaker.\n\nTwo of the other animals were named as Trojan and Tennyson. Service personnel were thrown to the floor and five of the animals broke loose, smashing into vehicles and causing a number of injuries.\n\nThe Army said three soldiers who were injured would \"recover fully and return to duty\". In a statement a spokesman said one of those operated on had been taken to an equine hospital.\n\nTwo horses on the loose bolt through the streets of London near Aldwych\n\nHe said: \"Of the seven horses which were spooked, five tried to bolt and four, Vida, Trojan, Quaker and Tennyson, broke loose. Two of the injured horses were operated on last night, with one transferred to an equine hospital. All remaining horses are being closely observed.\n\n\"Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course. We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses. We will provide more updates soon.\"\n\nDefence minister James Cartlidge said: \"There were five horses. They have all been recovered. Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition.\"\n\nHe added: \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\" Asked about the condition of two of the horses, the minister said he \"wouldn't want to say more\" than that they were in a serious condition.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't want that situation to happen. What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional.\n\n\"You are probably aware that the Army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n\"So this is extremely unlikely, this scenario. Unfortunately, we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\n\nQuaker (left) and Vida (right) are understood to have undergone life-saving surgery\n\nThe London Ambulance Service said it treated four people across three separate incidents. Injuries were reported in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square and the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, at around 8.25am.\n\nA serviceman was thrown to the ground in Buckingham Palace Road and one of the loose animals smashed into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering the windows.\n\nThe driver said a white horse collided with his Mercedes people carrier, leaving blood spattered down the side.

Two of them were seen shortly afterwards seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood, and later near the Limehouse tunnel, before they were located by City of London Police.\n\nAll horses were confirmed to have been recaptured by around 10.30am, and have since been returned to camp. They have undergone medical tests, officials said.\n\nA timeline of the loose horse incident in London\n\nLondon Ambulance Service said it received three horse-related calls during the incident on Wednesday. A taxi cab was damaged by a horse on Buckingham Palace Road, and the windscreen of a tour bus seen shattered a short while away.\n\nThey were all recaptured by 10.30am and given medical attention\n\nBBC Radio 2 travel presenter Bobbie Pryor, who has experience with horses, described desperately wanting to help after witnessing two horses rampaging as she left Charing Cross station. She said: \"It was horrendous - we all just stood watching thinking 'how are we going to help those horses'? Horses being loose is a huge fear - anyone who has been around horses knows just how terrifying it is, they've got tack, they've got loose reins. The best thing I could do if I couldn't catch them - and I couldn't safely do that - was just to get out of their way.\"\n\nOne witness described the scene as 'terrifying'\n\nA photographer meanwhile described the sight of a blood-soaked horse running past him in the capital as the \"most unusual thing I have seen in central London\". Jordan Pettitt, 26, who works for the PA news agency, said: \"There were two horses which came hurtling past. The horse on the right, as I was looking towards it, was jet black and had a saddle on it. The one to the left, which also had a saddle, was a really distinct white colour.\n\nA bus windscreen was shattered by one of the horses\n\n\"It had a really distinct red underbelly which we later found out was blood but it was so sharp and vivid that it seemed unlike blood as it was so saturated and rich. It was just two bright colours hurtling down this road and it went straight past me.\n\n\"It is probably the most unusual thing I have seen in central London so far. Seeing two riderless horses bolting down an empty A road in London is certainly unique and took me very much by surprise today.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"A number of military working horses become loose during routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp. A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedict_tetzlaff_deas@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Benedict Tetzlaff-Deas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of London Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_railway_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charing Cross railway station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Ambulance_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tunnel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_tack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse tack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32661309.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_London-horse-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional.\n\n'You are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n'So this is extremely unlikely this scenario. Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.'\n\nAn Army source told The Sun that the white horse that was drenched in blood, Vida, was 'lively' and had a history of being spooked.\n\nVida is thought to have kicked a soldier in the head during the King's Coronation.\n\nUsually Household Cavalry horses are black, however the regiment's state trumpeters always ride white or grey horses such as Vida.\n\nFour soldiers were unseated as the spooked horses bolted and three servicemen were injured and taken to hospital.

It was very scary,' he said.\n\n'It's rare to see horses stampeding down the street like that.\n\n'I heard a big bang from further down the road as the horse ran into the bus. Two others then also hit it and fell to the ground before getting up and running off.\n\n'The first one just stood there like it was stunned and turned around and then back again.\n\n'A man from the street came over and guided it out of the road and calmed it down. I was very impressed because he wasn't in any uniform. He just knew how to deal with the horse.\n\n'The front of the bus was completely shattered from the impact.'\n\nBashir Aden, 48, a construction worker, told The Telegraph: 'I saw a soldier falling down into the street after the horse ran into a car.

If you see a horse that appears to be in distress, call the police and provide as much detail as you can about its location.\n\nCall the police if you hit an animal. You by law have to call the police. The RSPCA will also help with an injured animal.'\n\nThe horse continued galloping down the street after the collision, shedding a horseshoe further down the busy road.\n\nMark Camps, who works at the IAC, said he saw the cyclist lying on the street in front of the building.\n\n'He was conscious and lying flat on his back in the road, but wasn't able to speak,' he explained.\n\n'Some passersby ran over to help him and carried him to the pavement. He still had his helmet on, luckily.\n\n'The ambulance eventually came around 9am and were able to move him.'\n\nPolice were reportedly in hot pursuit of the escaped horses, flying down the street five minutes behind the horses.\n\nA shopkeeper on Fleet Street said she heard the noise of the horses first as they galloped down the road at high speed, before hearing a commotion quickly followed by sirens.\n\n'There are usually police on horses around here,' she said. 'But this was clearly very different just from the sound. And then I saw the horses charge past, one covered in blood.\n\n'I texted my friend immediately after at 8:39am.'\n\nBuckingham Palace Road was closed after the shocking incident and a cordon was put in place.\n\nA blue tarpaulin tent was put up around the injured soldier.\n\nThe horses ran through the streets of Victoria and got as far east as Aldwych before they were calmed and contained by police on the Highway near Limehouse.\n\nOfficers are now waiting for Army horseboxes to take the animals away.\n\nA woman who saw the horse crash into the Mercedes told LBC: 'One of the horses hit the Mercedes van and the rider was on it, fell back on this little middle bit of the road and the other woman lost control of her horse and she managed to grab the railings.\n\n'The horses were injured obviously from the glasses that they had broken.

Army horses are stabled at the Hyde Park Barracks in London and spooked horses were seen charging as far away as Victoria (1 mile away), Aldwych (2.5 miles), Tower Bridge (5 miles), and Limehouse (7 miles), reports London broadcaster LBC.\n\nUpdate 11:30 -- Four hospitalised\n\nFour people were taken to hospital this morning after a group of five horses ran riderless through London. How many of these are thrown Army riders and how many were members of the public remains unclear.\n\nThe original story continues below\n\nPhotographers caught the moment bloodied horses, which are reported to have collided with vehicles and members of the public in their panic, coursing through the streets. Ambulances responded to injured individuals in three locations, it is stated, and at least one of those cases may have been to respond to thrown Army riders. Footage of the incident posted online shows a horse making its way towards apparently oblivious cyclists.\n\nPer reports, one horse charged into the front of a stationary bus, smashing the windscreen, and elsewhere a horse struck a van. The Army said in a statement: \"A number of military working horses become loose during routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp. A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"\n\nSome horses were recovered by police, while in other cases members of the public were able to approach and calm the injured animals, possibly preventing further incidents. One witness told newspaper The Daily Telegraph: \"I saw a soldier falling down into the street after the horse ran into a car. One of my colleagues called the police. The man hit the floor hard, he was screaming in pain. You could see blood all over the parked car.\n\n\"The horses come down this route every day, but today the horse looked stressed or panicked. I saw the horse run away after it hit a bus. People were screaming and running all over.\"\n\nDespite the passage of time horses remain a reasonably familiar sight in central London. The Metropolitan Police used mounted patrols, and the British Army keeps a large number of horses in central London for ceremonial duties. One of London's famous Royal Parks -- Hyde Park -- also has two gravelled paths for horse riding in the centre of the city.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_jj_lane@breitbart.com", "name": "Oliver Jj Lane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park_Barracks,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tower Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mounted_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mounted police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/04/GettyImages-2149382628-e1713952806244.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Two of the injured horses were operated on last night, with one transferred to an equine hospital. All remaining horses are being closely observed,\" the Army statement said.\n\n\"Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course. We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses. We will provide more updates soon,\" it said.\n\nQuaker is the horse still in hospital, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).\n\nEarlier, the Household Cavalry said the horses undergo regular \"routine exercise\" to get them used to loud city traffic sounds so they are well trained for major military parades and it was during one such exercise in the Belgravia area near Buckingham Palace on Wednesday morning that a few of them were spooked by builders dropping rubble from a height \"right next to them\".\n\nFirefighters assisted emergency services following the incident, using drones to locate the runaway horses.\n\n\"Due to reports that several horses were unaccounted for, the Brigade's response for large animal rescues was also alerted, along with the drone team and National Interagency Liaison Officers to assist in the search and the horses were quickly accounted for,\" said Assistant Commissioner Keeley Foster, who helped coordinate the London Fire Brigade's response.\n\nThe horses belonged to the Household Cavalry, which is the ceremonial guard of the British monarch and a regular feature of state functions in London. A taxi waiting near Buckingham Palace appeared to have a car window smashed in the mayhem, while a parked double-decker tourist bus had its windshield damaged.\n\n\"This was a dynamic incident and the courageous actions taken by police officers from our Roads Policing team prevented further harm and distress to the horses and members of the public,\" said Inspector Myles Hilbery from City of London Police.\n\nHilbery praised his police constables who he said had risked their own safety to provide first aid to the injured and anxious horses.\n\n\"They kept the horses calm while waiting for a horse box and veterinary team to arrive,\" he added.\n\nThe police force took control of the traffic, with officers on motorbikes creating a clear path for the horses to be safely led into the horse box and escorted back to the Army barracks for urgent medical care.

What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional.\n\n\"You are probably aware that the Army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n\"So this is extremely unlikely, this scenario.

outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows.\n\nAnother of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windscreen.\n\nTwo horses were then seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood.\n\nJordan Pettitt, 26, who works for the PA news agency, said the grey horse was \"vividly\" stained red with blood and he heard a black horse collide with a

(Jordan Pettitt/PA via AP)\n\nFive military horses spooked by noise from a building site bolted during routine exercises near Buckingham Palace, threw off four riders and caused chaos as they galloped loose through central London streets and collided with vehicles during the busy morning rush hour.\n\nThe commotion erupted when the horses from the Household Cavalry, which was conducting an extended exercise for an upcoming military parade, presumably became alarmed by the sound of concrete falling off a moving walkway at a construction site in Belgravia, a swanky neighbourhood just to the west of the palace.\n\nFive of the seven horses ran off and four soldiers were thrown off. Three of them were hospitalised with injuries. None of them were deemed to be life-threatening.\n\nThe horses -- minus their riders -- then ran through main roads in central London, hitting vehicles and stunning commuters as they headed to work. The horses were all captured shortly after and are back at the barracks in Hyde Park undergoing medical tests.\n\nWitnesses saw one of the loose animals crashing into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel nearby, shattering windows. Another of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windshield.\n\nPictures and videos shared widely across social media show two of the horses -- one white, one black -- running at speed down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial centre and the busy West End theatre district.\n\nThe white horse's face and legs were soaked in blood. A British Army spokesperson was not able to confirm what caused the injury.\n\nMegan Morra, who was on her way to work, told the BBC that she saw the striking image of the white horse with a head injury.\n\n\"There was a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I was a bit distressed to be honest, looking at the poor horse.\"\n\nThe horses are from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London.\n\nThe extent of the injuries the horses suffered were not immediately known.\n\nIn a video statement on X, formerly Twitter, Matt Woodward, Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said around 150 horses are exercised every morning in parks and on the roads to keep them fit and get them used to the surroundings and the noise so they are less easily panicked during parades.\n\n\"This morning, however, a small group of horses were spooked by some construction works on a quiet side road in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them,\" he said.\n\n\"Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare,\" Woodward added. He thanked the emergency responders and members of the public for reacting quickly.\n\n\"This enabled swift treatment of our soldiers and helped bring our injured horses to safety,\" he added.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service said it treated four people across three separate incidents in the space of 10 minutes after the incident erupted around 8.30am.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz",

Two minutes later medics were called to nearby Belgrave Square and found two people injured by horses and took them to hospital. A further call was made at 8.35am at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street and a fourth person was taken to hospital.\n\nThe casualties were treated in three incidents that took place in the space of just 10 minutes.

Four service personnel were thrown from their horses and five of the animals got loose, smashing into vehicles and causing a number of injuries.\n\nTwo of the animals, a black horse and a white one drenched in blood, were seen galloping through central London. The pair were captured on the Highway near Limehouse, more than five miles from where they first bolted.\n\nTwo horses on the loose through the streets of London near Aldwych\n\nIt has now emerged that Vida, the blood-soaked white horse that was injured following the incident, might have a history of being spooked, including at the Coronation last year. The two horses were \"in a serious condition\" after the incident, Defence Minister James Cartlidge said this morning.\n\nThe Army then confirmed the two military horses have undergone operations, adding that three soldiers who were injured would \"recover fully and return to duty\". The statement said: \"Of the seven horses which were spooked, five tried to bolt and four, Vida, Trojan, Quaker and Tennyson, broke loose.\n\n\"Two of the injured horses were operated on last night, with one transferred to an equine hospital. All remaining horses are being closely observed. Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course.\n\nThe horses were finally captured in Limehouse\n\n\"We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses. We will provide more updates soon.\" Jordan Pettitt, 26, said Vida was \"vividly\" stained red with blood and he heard a black horse collide with a taxi.\n\nThe animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel before they were recaptured by City of London Police and taken away to be assessed by Army vets. In an update on X, formerly Twitter, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said on Wednesday: \"This morning, a small group of horses were spooked by construction works on a quiet side road where building materials were dropped from height next to them.\n\n\"The ensuing shock caused all horses to bolt and unseated some riders. Our immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of our soldiers, members of the public and our horses. Our horses have all returned to Hyde Park Barracks and are undergoing veterinary care. Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and number of horses involved this type of incident is extremely rare.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgravia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cartlidge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Cartlidge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alfred, Lord Tennyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Defence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry_Mounted_Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City of London Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32666831.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_London-horse-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Then as they came past me at some speed, they went straight down to the bottom of the road where it meets Fleet Street.\n\n'The traffic lights were at red with a few buses and some taxis waiting there. These horses came hurtling down past the pedestrian crossing at that moment. Then the black horse collided with a black taxi.\n\n'It was not to a great degree of power but it hit it strongly enough that we could hear it at the top of the road. You could hear the contact. Then it veered behind the taxi, went past the bus and headed eastbound on Fleet Street.\n\n'The white horse that was with it looked like it doubled back on itself and then followed the black one as it went eastbound.'\n\n10.30am: The final horses are captured\n\nThe animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel, before they were recaptured by City of London Police and taken away to be assessed by Army vets.\n\nRoland, a worker for tour bus company Tootbus, described the chaotic scenes near Victoria.\n\n'I saw horses come from the bus station in front of Victoria run around in a frenzy,' he said.

expected to follow his father King Charles and grandfather Prince Philip into the Welsh Guards after graduating from Sandhurst.\n\nHe was said to have opted for the Household Cavalry so he could pursue his love of horses.\n\nWilliam, who passed out of Sandhurst military academy after his younger brother, joined his brother in the Household Cavalry because of the variety of roles that the regiment undertakes.\n\nThe Palace said that William was attracted by the regiment's record in recent conflicts, including the Falklands War, the 1991 Gulf War and operations in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Blue and Royals and the Life Guards are the oldest and most senior regiments in the Army.\n\nPrincess Diana's former lover, James Hewitt, served as a captain in the Life Guards.\n\nHarry left the Army in March 2015 and then had to give up his honorary military appointments after ending his role as a working royal.\n\nPrince William went on to serve with the Royal Air

Five horses from the Household Cavalry bolted during a rehearsal, having been frightened by noisy builders near Buckingham Palace. At least four people were hurt and several vehicles smashed. Two of the animals travelled five miles to Limehouse, in east London, before they were rounded up.\n\nIt's no wonder people were surprised. If you live in London, you're unlikely to see horses regularly - and, if you do see them, they'd usually be behaving themselves and on duty, not galloping blind and riderless through the roads.\n\nWhile the horses that the army and police use for their respective duties are subject to thorough training and exposed to all kinds of sights and sounds before they're allowed out on public duty, we need to remember that horses will always be horses. They are flight animals, whose instincts will tell them to run away from any dangerous situation. They're also herd animals; if one animals gets scared and runs, the others are naturally inclined to follow.\n\nAlthough the vehicle-packed London of today is not naturally suited to horses, it hasn't always been this way. Only 150 years ago, the streets of the capital would have been equally packed with horses: some pulling private carriages; others harnessed to forms of public transport such as horse-drawn omnibuses or wagonettes pulled by two or three horses, and other horses carrying riders. Many houses in the suburbs had their own stable, as did most pubs - particularly coaching inns. The mews houses of central London which today sell for several million pounds a pop were built as stabling and grooms' accommodation. And London's street names still pay homage to equines: Dray Walk, Stable Way, Cheval Place, and so on.\n\nPeople may well complain about air pollution caused by vehicle emissions today, but while there was no Ulez (Ultra-low emission zone) charge in the 1800s, there were plenty of equine emissions. In London alone, an army of around 8,000 road sweepers worked through the night to clear up horse manure, toiling in the darkness to tidy the streets in time for the morning rush. Wagons which had brought food and produce from the countryside to London returned home carrying horse manure back to the fields where it could be put to use.\n\nThe London of then was a very different place from today. After this morning's furore, many people have been asking why there are still horses in London today, and questioning whether they ought to be there.\n\nIt's true that, if given a choice, a horse would probably prefer to be in a green pasture somewhere far from the hustle and bustle of the capital than treading over tarmac every day. But the few horses that are still here in London do play an important role.\n\nThe horses of the Met's Mounted Branch are housed at one of eight stables across the capital. The City of London Police also maintain a mounted branch. Just yesterday, as the police clashed with protestors at a St George's Day rally on Downing Street, mounted police were on crowd-patrol duty. While being on a horse provides a better vantage point at events like this or at football matches, a policeman on horseback can also act as more of a physical deterrent to any would-be troublemakers.\n\nThe Army horses on the other hand - mainly those of the Household Cavalry - are mainly used for ceremonial purposes. There will almost always be two horses from the King's Life Guard division on guard duty at Horse Guards: the official entrance to Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace. At events like Trooping the Colour, State Visits and the State Opening of Parliament, as well as at other ceremonial occasions, Household Cavalry horses will take pride of place at the centre of proceedings. The Army argue that the use of horses in their ceremonial duties sends a message to the rest of the world about their operational capabilities: 'For a country with global interests these roles offer a powerful symbol of our operational military heritage, whilst enhancing the standing of the Sovereign and the Nation before both national and international audiences.'\n\nPerhaps the London of 2024 isn't the ideal home for a horse; but it's both important to remember and a huge tribute to these animals that, 99 per cent of the time, these horses and the daily cacophony of London life go hand in hand with little or no disturbance to the daily grind.\n\nThe horses are wonderfully treated, and all those involved in today's incident have already been seen by the vets and are being treated accordingly. During the summer, the Army horses travel to Norfolk for an annual training camp and enjoy a beach ride at Holkham Bay. Similarly, the horses of the mounted police regiments don't live in London permanently, and regularly enjoy 'time out' in the countryside for a change of scenery.\n\nIt's also important for some of the specific breeds of horse who suit police or army service that they continue to have a role. There are fewer than 3,000 Shire horses in Britain today, and the breed is classed as being officially 'At Risk', as many of the jobs that they were bred to do are now carried out by machines or tractors. Most people who want a horse these days don't need anything of that size or strength. But the Household Cavalry's drum horses are typically Shires, meaning that, as long as horses continue to carry out ceremonial duties, Shires will still have this role. Similarly the Irish Draft horses and crosses used by the Police and Army are less in demand as riding horses, but can continue their lines as long as the Mounted Regiments exist.\n\nThe sight of horses running amok in London was shocking, and we should hope that those injured are recovering well. But while there will be questions about how this incident was allowed to happen - and about why it took so long to bring the horses under control - the truth is that we'd miss these animals if they vanished for good from the streets of London.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "camilla_swift@spectator.us", "name": "Camilla

The man filming the video can be heard saying: \"The horses are having a bit of a dance show this morning, they're not settling down as quick as they usually do.\"\n\nThe video then shows commotion among the crowd, with a black horse appearing unsettled and moving in a frantic manner, before the rider is thrown to the floor. This also leads to other horses tugging against their harnesses and some of the people in the crowd can be seen moving backwards.\n\nA white horse was covered in blood\n\nAfter the Life Guard falls, the person behind the camera says: \"Oh a trooper has been thrown, oh good lord.\" The horse then moves away from the rider before police arrive to check if he is injured.\n\nMeanwhile, a woman urges people in the crowd to remain still as a soldier moves towards the horse to keep the animal under control. Then, a medic arrives to take care of the rider and the crowd applauds as he gets back on his feet.\n\nIt is not clear if the incident happened before or after horses were seen running through London after being spooked by construction works. Five of the horses managed to get loose and smashed into vehicles, before being brought under control.\n\nA white horse collided with a Mercedes people carrier, leaving blood splattered down the side. Another horse ran into a tour bus, smashing the windscreen. The shocking sight led people to question how they ended up running around the streets of London, it was later learned they had escaped during a military exercise by the Household Cavalry.\n\nThe horses collided with a bus tour\n\nThis morning, Defence Minister James Cartlidge said two horses are in a serious condition. He told Sky News: \"There were five horses. They have all been recovered. Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition.\"\n\nHe added: \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\" The minister confirmed the two horses are named Vida and Quaker.\n\nThe horses were eventually captured in Limehouse, east London\n\nIn another interview with LBC, the minister described the incident as \"very exceptional\", adding: \"Obviously, we didn't want that situation to happen. What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional. You are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week.\n\n\"It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day. So this is extremely unlikely this scenario. Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Guards_Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse Guards Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cartlidge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Cartlidge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_National_Defence_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of National Defence (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32666827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_London-horse-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

We will provide more updates soon,\" it said.\n\nQuaker is the horse still in hospital, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).\n\nEarlier, the Household Cavalry said the horses undergo regular \"routine exercise\" to get them used to loud city traffic sounds so they are well trained for major military parades and it was during one such exercise in the Belgravia area near Buckingham Palace on Wednesday morning that a few of them were spooked by builders dropping rubble from a height \"right next to them\".\n\nFirefighters assisted emergency services following the incident, using drones to locate the runaway horses.\n\n\"Due to reports that several horses were unaccounted for, the Brigade's response for large animal rescues was also alerted, along with the drone team and National Interagency Liaison Officers to assist in the search and the horses were quickly accounted for,\" said Assistant Commissioner Keeley Foster, who helped coordinate the London Fire Brigade's response.\n\nThe horses belonged to the Household Cavalry, which is the ceremonial guard of the British monarch and a regular feature of state functions in London. A taxi waiting near Buckingham Palace appeared to have a car window smashed in the mayhem, while a parked double-decker tourist bus had its windshield damaged.\n\n\"This was a dynamic incident and the courageous actions taken by police officers from our Roads Policing team prevented further harm and distress to the horses and members of the public,\" said Inspector Myles Hilbery from City of London Police.\n\nHilbery praised his police constables who he said had risked their own safety to provide first aid to the injured and anxious horses.\n\n\"They kept the horses calm while waiting for a horse box and veterinary team to arrive,\" he added.\n\nThe police force took control of the traffic, with officers on motorbikes creating a clear path for the horses to be safely led into the horse box and escorted back to the Army barracks for urgent medical care.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition.\"\n\nHe added: \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\"\n\nAsked about the condition of two of the horses by LBC, the minister said he \"wouldn't want to say more\" than that they were in a serious condition. He added: \"Obviously, we didn't want that situation to happen. What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional.\n\n\"You are probably aware that the Army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n\"So this is extremely unlikely, this scenario. Unfortunately, we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\n\nAmbulance crews treated four people on Wednesday in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10 minutes.\n\nThe drama began near Buckingham Palace Road where witnesses saw a serviceman thrown from his horse, and one of the loose animals crashed into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows.\n\nAnother of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windscreen. Two horses were then seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood.\n\nJordan Pettitt, 26, who works for the PA news agency, said the grey horse was \"vividly\" stained red with blood and he heard a black horse collide with a taxi.\n\nThe animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel, before they were recaptured by City of London Police and taken away to be assessed by Army vets.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "howard_lloyd@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Howard Lloyd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alfred, Lord Tennyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cartlidge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Cartlidge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgravia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrave_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgrave Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City of London Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancery_Lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancery Lane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fleet Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article29056539.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_London-horse-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Held at the side of the road by officers, the white horse began bleeding out onto the road, drenched in blood.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Woodward, the Commanding Officer of the Household Calvary Mounted Regiment, said the horses are 'undergoing veterinary care' and were all safely returned to Hyde Park Barracks to recover.\n\nThe horse was seen galloping through the streets of London in terrifying scenes this morning\n\nThis blood-soaked Household Cavalry horse was one of five that bolted during a morning exercise today (pictured between Tower Bridge and the Limehouse tunnel)\n\nThe horses bolted and went on a six-mile rampage through central London today\n\nRubble being moved from a building on Wilton Crescent Wilton Crescent, a street in the Belgravia area, where builders using a travelator with concrete spooked the horses\n\nA soldier was seen bandaging its rear left leg in addition to other bandages for the bleeding\n\nOnlookers said one of the Household Cavalry soldiers was left 'screaming in pain' after he was thrown from his horse when it struck a car by the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road, Victoria.\n\nFootage of two horses being caught outside Gordon House on the Glamis Estate in Limehouse, east London, appeared to show that the white horse had broken its leg.\n\nREAD MORE - Moment escaped Household Cavalry horse 'spooked by builders' is finally captured: Bleeding animal with badly injured leg is loaded into horsebox after six-mile rampage\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill drenched in blood, the horse's back left leg was bandaged and the animal seemed unwilling to walk on it.\n\nHeld at the side of the road by several officers, the white horse bled all over the road and was treated by vets at the scene.\n\nFootage shows it bleeding profusely from its back leg as police gathered around to stem the flow.\n\nBuilder Tom Cahill saw the horses being collected by the army at around 9.30am.\n\nHe said: 'The horses had stopped and the police caught up to them.\n\n'It looked like the white horse had broken its leg.'\n\nThere was so much blood that there wasn't enough water to clean it up, and a fire engine had to be called in to hose down the area.\n\nThe horses were all caught and accounted for by 10.30am, the Met Police said.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the regiment said: 'Every morning, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment in London exercises some 150 horses in the parks and on the roads.\n\nThe last two horses were finally caught outside the Glamis Estate in Limehouse this morning\n\nBuilder Tom Cahill saw the horses being collected by the army.

They are garrisoned at Hyde Park barracks, less than a mile away from Buckingham Palace.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2024/04/video-military-horses-run-loose-through-london-four-people-injured/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1713987806776/associated-press-london-horses-1120.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The powerful animals were scared when concrete was dropped by builders and landed next to them, causing four service personnel to be thrown from their steeds, reports the Mirror.\n\nFive of the horses got loose, smashing into vehicles and causing a number of injuries. They were pictured running through busy areas of the city, one of them bloodied, before they were finally stopped and brought under control.\n\nIn an update on X, formerly Twitter, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said: \"This morning, a small group of horses were spooked by construction works on a quiet side road where building materials were dropped from height next to them.\n\n\"The ensuing shock caused all horses to bolt and unseated some riders. Our immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of our soldiers, members of the public and our horses. Our horses have all returned to Hyde Park Barracks and are undergoing veterinary care. Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and number of horses involved this type of incident is extremely rare.\"\n\nThree soldiers were assessed in hospital for their injuries, but they were not thought to be serious. A white horse collided with a Mercedes people carrier, leaving blood splattered down the side. Another of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windscreen in the process.\n\nThe animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel, before they were recaptured by London cops and taken away to be assessed by Army vets.\n\nIn a Tweet, the British Army said: \"Thank you to Met Police, City of London Police, London Ambulance Service, London Fire Brigade and members of the public for reacting as quickly as they did. This enabled the swift treatment of our soldiers and helped us to bring our injured horses to safety.\"\n\nWitness Tula, a management consultant from south London, said: \"I got off the 172 bus which ends at Aldwych and two horses went flying past. One black, one white. The white one was drenched in blood from the chest down and they were galloping through the traffic at speed.\n\n\"People were stopping in the street shocked. The horses were running into fast-moving traffic and seemed terrified. Some unmarked police cars were chasing after them, which didn't seem to be helping. I felt shocked. It was pretty gruesome. Felt like a weird dream.\"\n\nInspector Myles Hilbery, City of London Police added: \"This was a dynamic incident and the courageous actions taken by police officers from our Roads Policing team prevented further harm and distress to the horses and members of the public.\n\n\"Police Constables Lucy Hawes and Daniel McKeown risked their own safety to provide first aid to the injured and anxious horses. They kept the horses calm while waiting for a horse box and veterinary team to arrive.\n\n\"PCs Brett Daniels and Chris Wilson took over management of traffic control on the busy arterial road enabling PCs Rob Bray and Shaun Gurney on motorbikes to create a clear path for the horses to be safely led into the horse box and escorted back to the Army barracks for urgent medical care. Our thoughts are with those people and horses injured in the incident.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

Whether they will recover enough to return to official duties, it's too early to know for sure.\n\n'But they've been given the best veterinary treatment possible and had they not been attached to the army then I don't believe they would have made it this far.\n\n'Vida was the most visibly injured and the pictures of the horse running through London soaked in blood were horrifying. Vida was operated on overnight and is currently in stables at the Hyde Park Barracks under observation.\n\n'Quaker is the most seriously injured and was also operated on overnight but it was decided to move the horse to an equine hospital in the early hours.\n\n'The extent of the injuries is not completely clear but we don't believe at this stage there are any broken bones. The injuries are consistent with serious lacerations.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning, six soldiers and seven horses from the Life Guards were on an extended Watering Order, an exercise to keep up the fitness of animals not involved in the public-facing King's Life Guard duties.\n\nThey are thought to have been spooked by the noise and five bolted, with two remaining in place.\n\nAn Army spokesperson said: 'Two of the injured horses were operated on last night, with one transferred to an equine hospital. All remaining horses are being closely observed.\n\n'All three soldiers involved are expected to recover fully and to return to duty.\n\n'Of the seven horses which were spooked, five tried to bolt and four, Vida, Trojan, Quaker and Tennyson, broke loose.\n\n'Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course.\n\n'We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses.'\n\nDefence minister James Cartlidge said Vida and Quaker were 'in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive'.\n\nHe told Sky News today: '[They] are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition.'\n\nThe military horses who ran loose through London was an 'exceptional' situation, the minister added, explaining more than 150 animals are on exercise in the capital each day.\n\nToday, members of the Household Cavalry are set to parade at the Major General's annual inspection of the Mounted Regiment.\n\nMr Cartlidge told LBC: 'Obviously, we didn't want that situation to happen. What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional.\n\n'You are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n'So this is extremely unlikely this scenario. Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.'\n\nAn Army source told The Sun that the white horse that was drenched in blood, Vida, was 'lively' and had a history of being spooked.\n\nVida is thought to have kicked a soldier in the head during the King's Coronation.\n\nUsually Household Cavalry horses are black, however the regiment's state trumpeters always ride white or grey horses such as Vida.\n\nFour soldiers were unseated as the spooked horses bolted and three servicemen were injured and taken to hospital. None are in a life-threatening condition.\n\nOnlookers yesterday said one of the Household Cavalry soldiers was left 'screaming in pain' after he was thrown from his horse when it struck a car by the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road, Victoria.\n\nThe horses rampaged for six miles before they were finally caught in Limehouse, east London. The injured horses saw a vet and all of the animals are now back at the Army's camp.\n\nOne of the horses has also seemingly ran into a double-decker bus, smashing its windscreen, while another reportedly crashed into a black cab.\n\nEmergency services rushed to help the injured soldier, who was seen being treated on the road.\n\nConstruction worker Adejo Are said he saw one of the horses crash into the front of a Big Bus as it fled down Buckingham Palace Road.\n\n'The were running down the street at a very high speed. It was very scary,' he said.\n\n'It's rare to see horses stampeding down the street like that.\n\n'I heard a big bang from further down the road as the horse ran into the bus. Two others then also hit it and fell to the ground before getting up and running off.\n\n'The first one just stood there like it was stunned and turned around and then back again.\n\n'A man from the street came over and guided it out of the road and calmed it down. I was very impressed because he wasn't in any uniform. He just knew how to deal with the horse.\n\n'The front of the bus was completely shattered from the impact.'\n\nBashir Aden, 48, a construction worker, told The Telegraph: 'I saw a soldier falling down into the street after the horse ran into a car. One of my colleagues called the police.\n\n'The man hit the floor hard, he was screaming in pain.\n\n'You could see blood all over the parked car.'\n\nA silver Mercedes-Benz people carrier was also hit by another horse, with damage to its side and two rear windows broken.\n\nThe Mercedes taxi driver spoke of his 'shock' after a loose Household Cavalry horse smashed into his car near Buckingham Palace.\n\nOne of the horses smashed into his people carrier, shattering his windows and leaving deep dents in his car.\n\nThere were also specks of blood splattered across the side.\n\nThe driver, called Farez, revealed how he was completely unaware of the horses until one slammed into his car.\n\nHe had been waiting for a passenger when the horse struck his car.\n\nHe told LBC: 'I was just sitting in the car to pick up my passenger, but on the other side there was a [horse] but I didn't see.'\n\n'When the horse hit my car then I saw, it was like a smash.'\n\nRecalling how bystanders came over to the car to check on his welfare, Farez added: 'I was ok, but it [the car] is damaged.\n\nThen we stopped all the traffic and the one military guy fell down.'\n\nHe added: 'I saw about three, four horses. The think the white horse hit my car.'\n\nAnother man was trampled by one of the horses as he cycled to work along Fleet Street.\n\nOnlookers say they saw two horses - one black and one white - charging down the street towards Ludgate at around 8.30am.\n\nThe man, described as in his late 30s to early 40s, was knocked off his bike by the white horse outside of the International Arbitration Centre (IAC) in Fleet Street.\n\nThe horse continued galloping down the street after the collision, shedding a horseshoe further down the busy road.\n\nMark Camps, who works at the IAC, said he saw the cyclist lying on the street in front of the building.\n\n'He was conscious and lying flat on his back in the road, but wasn't able to speak,' he explained.\n\n'Some passersby ran over to help him and carried him to the pavement. He still had his helmet on, luckily.\n\n'The ambulance eventually came around 9am and were able to move him.'\n\nPolice were reportedly in hot pursuit of the escaped horses, flying down the street five minutes behind the horses.\n\nA shopkeeper on Fleet Street said she heard the noise of the horses first as they galloped down the road at high speed, before hearing a commotion quickly followed by sirens.\n\n'There are usually police on horses around here,' she said. 'But this was clearly very different just from the sound. And then I saw the horses charge past, one covered in blood.\n\n'I texted my friend immediately after at 8:39am.'\n\nBuckingham Palace Road was closed after the shocking incident and a cordon was put in place.\n\nA blue tarpaulin tent was put up around the injured soldier.\n\nThe horses ran through the streets of Victoria and got as far east as Aldwych before they were calmed and contained by police on the Highway near Limehouse.\n\nOfficers are now waiting for Army horseboxes to take the animals away.\n\nA woman who saw the horse crash into the Mercedes told LBC: 'One of the horses hit the Mercedes van and the rider was on it, fell back on this little middle bit of the road and the other woman lost control of her horse and she managed to grab the railings.\n\n'The horses were injured obviously from the glasses that they had broken. [The injured soldier] was laying there on the ground. He looked like he hurt himself pretty bad. It was terrible.'\n\nThe horses were all caught and accounted for by 10.30am, the Met Police said.\n\nFootage of two horses being caught outside Gordon House on the Glamis Estate in Limehouse, east London, appeared to show that the white horse had broken its leg.\n\nStill drenched in blood, the horse's back left leg was bandaged and the animal seemed unwilling to walk on it.\n\nThe police worked with soldiers to contain the horses before moving them into an Army horsebox.\n\nThe animals were reportedly calm and stationary by the time the police reached them.\n\nHeld at the side of the road by several officers, the white horse bled all over the road and was treated by vets at the scene.\n\nFootage shows it bleeding profusely from its back leg as police gathered around to stem the flow.\n\nBuilder Tom Cahill saw the horses being collected by the army.\n\nHe said: 'The horses had stopped and the police caught up to them.\n\n'It looked like the white horse had broken its leg.\n\n'At first there were just a few police officers but then they called the army in.\n\n'After they took the horses away they were trying to clean up all the blood but they didn't have enough water.\n\n'There was so much blood they had to call the fire department to clean it up.'\n\nMany people living in Gordon House saw the commotion as they left for the school run.\n\nJunaid Ahmed said he saw the scene from his bedroom window.\n\nHe said: 'It was so sad - I have pets myself and seeing all that blood dripping onto the street....I just hope he's alright.\n\n'I even saw some of the police officers crying as they were treating the horse.'\n\nAn Army Spokesperson said: 'A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning.\n\n'All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp.\n\n'A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.'\n\nThe City of London Police said: 'At around 8.40am, we were called about horses that had became loose and were travelling through the City.\n\n'Our officers have contained two horses on the Highway near Limehouse. We're waiting for an Army horse box to collect the horses and transport them to veterinary care.'\n\nLondon Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 8.25am today [Wednesday] to reports of a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road, SW1W.\n\n'We sent resources to the scene including ambulance crews, a paramedic in a fast response car, and an incident response officer.\n\n'Our first paramedic was on the scene in five minutes.'\n\nThe Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment Commanding Officer Matt Woodward said: 'Our immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of our soldiers, members of the public and our horses.'\n\nThe Household Cavalry - the regiment the horses were from - guards the monarch at Buckingham Palace and acts as the Sovereign's mounted escort on state occasions.\n\nIt also provides reconnaissance support to airborne forces on operations and has seen more than a few famous faces among its ranks.\n\nPopstar James Blunt served in the regiment in the 1990s after training at Sandhurst military academy and went on to see active service in Kosovo.\n\nBoth Prince Harry and Prince William were also soldiers in the Household Cavalry's other regiment, the Blues and Royals.\n\nPrince Harry was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the regiment in 2006 before being joined by Prince William later that year.\n\nBlunt, 50, served in the Armed Forces for six years. As a Household Cavalry Life Guard, he stood sentry as the Queen Mother's body lay in state and rode as the Queen's Sovereign Escort on ceremonial escort.\n\nHe was also one of the first peacekeepers to enter Pristina, Kosovo's capital, where he encountered chilling evidence of ethnic cleansing. This experience inspired his song No Bravery.\n\nSpeaking of his time in Kosovo in 2021, he told of a tense encounter with Russian forces.\n\nHe said: 'I was the lead officer of 30,000 NATO troops.\n\n'We got to an airport where the Russians were there already. I was given instruction to overrun and overpower them.\n\n'Fortunately, a general who had been given that instruction was confronted by our own general who said, 'I'm not having my soldiers start World War III and told us to pull back'.'\n\nMeanwhile, Harry, the Duke of Sussex, rose to the rank of lieutenant in the Blues and Royals before he retrained as an Apache helicopter co-pilot in 2012 for his second tour of Afghanistan.\n\nHe chose to wear his regimental uniform when he married Meghan Markle at Windsor's St George's Chapel in 2018.\n\nThe duke had been expected to follow his father King Charles and grandfather Prince Philip into the Welsh Guards after graduating from Sandhurst.\n\nHe was said to have opted for the Household Cavalry so he could pursue his love of horses.\n\nWilliam, who passed out of Sandhurst military academy after his younger brother, joined his brother in the Household Cavalry because of the variety of roles that the regiment undertakes.\n\nThe Palace said that William was attracted by the regiment's record in recent conflicts, including the Falklands War, the 1991 Gulf War and operations in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Blue and Royals and the Life Guards are the oldest and most senior regiments in the Army.\n\nPrincess Diana's former lover, James Hewitt, served as a captain in the Life Guards.\n\nHarry left the Army in March 2015 and then had to give up his honorary military appointments after ending his role as a working royal.\n\nPrince William went on to serve with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy before leaving active service in 2013.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline",

Three of them were hospitalised with injuries. None of them were deemed to be life-threatening.\n\nThe horses -- minus their riders -- then ran through main roads in central London, hitting vehicles and stunning commuters. The horses were all captured shortly after and were taken to barracks in Hyde Park for medical tests.\n\nWitnesses saw one of the loose animals crashing into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel nearby, shattering windows.

expected to follow his father King Charles and grandfather Prince Philip into the Welsh Guards after graduating from Sandhurst.\n\nHe was said to have opted for the Household Cavalry so he could pursue his love of horses.\n\nWilliam, who passed out of Sandhurst military academy after his younger brother, joined his brother in the Household Cavalry because of the variety of roles that the regiment undertakes.\n\nThe Palace said that William was attracted by the regiment's record in recent conflicts, including the Falklands War, the 1991 Gulf War and operations in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Blue and Royals and the Life Guards are the oldest and most senior regiments in the Army.\n\nPrincess Diana's former lover, James Hewitt, served as a captain in the Life Guards.\n\nHarry left the Army in March 2015 and then had to give up his honorary military appointments after ending his role as a working royal.\n\nPrince William went on to serve with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy before leaving active service in 2013.\n\nWhat is the Household Cavalry?\n\nThe Household Cavalry Regiment is an elite cavalry unit, taking part in every major conflict since 1660.\n\nIt is made up of the two most senior regiments in the British Army: The Life Guards and The Blues & Royals.\n\nIt is divided into the Household Cavalry Regiment and the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nThe Household Cavalry Regiment is the operational unit, providing an armoured reconnaissance capability with the state-of-the-art AJAX armoured fighting vehicle.\n\nSoldiers are

The chaos unfolded when two horses were spotted galloping along the road near Aldwych, with one appearing to be bloodstained.\n\nDefence minister James Cartlidge told Sky News on Thursday morning: \"There were five horses. They have all been recovered. Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Man, 65, in critical condition after 'sickening attack' by 'two teenagers' at Stockport Interchange\n\nHe added: \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\" The minister also confirmed the names of the two animals, Vida and Quaker.\n\nMr Cartilage said the situation was 'exceptional,' explaining more than 150 animals are on exercise in the capital each day. Pressed on the condition of the horses by LBC, he said he 'wouldn't want to say more' than that they were in a serious condition.\n\nHe added: \"Obviously, we didn't want that situation to happen. What I would stress to you is that this is very exceptional. You are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day.\n\n\"So this is extremely unlikely this scenario. Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\n\nA taxi driver, who was parked outside the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road, had his Mercedes people carrier's windows shattered by one startled horse. Additionally, a double-decker tour bus parked nearby suffered a smashed windscreen after being hit by one of the horses.\n\nLBC interviewed Faraz, the Mercedes driver, who recounted the moment his vehicle was struck while he waited outside the Clermont Hotel. He witnessed three or four horses close to his car and saw a soldier being thrown off and hurt.\n\nAuthorities believe that seven horses initially escaped, with police collaborating with the Army to secure them. Social media was flooded with images and footage of two horses running wild through the streets of London, including one video showing a black 4x4 with blue lights in pursuit of the animals between Tower Bridge and Limehouse tunnel.\n\nCity of London Police officers managed to capture two horses that had broken loose and were wandering through the city.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSeveral loose horses caused mayhem on the streets of London on Wednesday after becoming spooked during a routine rehearsal.\n\nFour people have been taken to hospital following the incident, as at least two of the horses running several miles across the capital.\n\nFootage shows the animals - one covered in blood - colliding with vehicles, with at least on report of a collision with a person.\n\nThe two horses are believed to have travelled from Belgravia, near Buckingham Palace, all the way to the East London area of Shadwell.\n\nAt around 11am, an Army spokesperson said: \"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp.\n\n\"A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"\n\nHere is the full timeline of the horses' movements:\n\nBelgravia, between 8am and 8.25am\n\nFour soliders are dismounted after five horses are spooked during a rehearsal in Belgravia, central London.\n\nThis area is located between Hyde Park Barracks, which hosts the stables where most of the Household Cavalry horses are kept, and the Horse Guard near Whitehall.\n\nAn army spokesperson has said that one serviceman was responsible for two horses, explaining the additional horse.\n\nJust before 8.25am, one serviceman is severely injured after his horse collides with a car on Buckingham Palace Road, throwing him to the ground. The London Ambulance service arrives on the scene promptly.\n\nAt least two horses, one white and one black, then begin to run towards Buckingham Palace.\n\nOn the way, one collides with a parked tour bus, causing serious damage. It is thought this is how the white horse sustained the injury seen in footage and images.\n\nThe Strand, between 8.30am and 8.35am\n\nAfter running past Buckingham Palace, the two horses speed down The Mall towards The Strand, covering nearly 2 miles in around five minutes.\n\nMaking their way around Aldwych, the black horse collides with a taxi outside of a coffee shop.\n\nBoth continue down Fleet Street, when one hits a person on the corner of Chancery Lane.

One black, one white.\n\n\"The white one was drenched in blood from the chest down and they were galloping through the traffic at speed.\n\n\"People were stopping in the street shocked. The horses were running into fast-moving traffic and seemed terrified. Some unmarked police cars were chasing after them, which didn't seem to be helping.\n\n\"I felt shocked. It was pretty gruesome. Felt like a weird dream.\"\n\nA group of seven horses and six soldiers from the Household Cavalry were on an extended exercise in Belgravia, central London, on Wednesday when chaos erupted.\n\nAmbulance crews treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10\n\nBobbie Pryor, a travel presenter for BBC Radio Two, said she contemplated throwing herself in the path of two of the runaway horses\n\nShe recounted witnessing the horses charging through the street outside Charing Cross station as she was on her morning commute.\n\nShe told Jeremy Vine's lunchtime radio programme: \"As I looked to the left I saw two horses coming towards me, I ran just to get across the road.\n\n\"It was coming at such a speed, I thought, I need to stop those horses, I need to stop those horses but they are huge and coming at speed.\n\nAsked by Jeremy Vine how she would have attempted to stop them, she replied: \"I have been around horses before but normally you try and put yourself in the way, if it is safe to do so.\n\n\"There was a clear road ahead and I was thinking if I don't stop them they are going to go straight into those buses up there and that is really upsetting.\n\n\"Also you can't get in the way, in the fact at least they are running in a straight line, you have got people either side, you have got glass windows, you could create a worse situation.\n\n\"At least if they run for a bit they may be able to run out of breath.\"\n\nA photographer has said he was surprised to see a bloodstained riderless white horse charge past him in central London on Wednesday morning.\n\nJordan Pettitt, 26, who works for the PA news agency, said: \"There were two horses which came hurtling past.\n\nThe horse on the right, as I was looking towards it, was jet black and had a saddle on it. The one to the left, which also had a saddle, was a really distinct white colour.\n\n\"It had a really distinct red underbelly which we later found out was blood but it was so sharp and vivid that it seemed unlike blood as it was so saturated and rich.\n\n\"It was just two bright colours hurtling down this road and it went straight past me.\n\n\"It is probably the most unusual thing I have seen in central London so far. Seeing two riderless horses bolting down an empty A road in London is certainly unique and took me very much by surprise today.\"\n\nAn eyewitness has described seeing one of the injured horses being restrained by police officers during her morning commute.\n\nMegan Maurer told BBC Radio 2: \"I saw three police officers or security guards running down the middle of Buckingham Palace Road, quite frantically, I would say.\n\n\"I looked up and I saw a horse being led in the direction coming towards me and the horse was very bloody. The poor thing looked like it was in really rough shape there was blood all over its legs and on its head.\n\n\"There looked like there was some form of injury on its head but it had been captured.\"\n\nShe added: \"It was not completely incapacitated, it was walking but it was covered in blood, it was such a confusing sight to see, it looked like it had an injury above its right eye.\"\n\nHenry Bodkin, reporting from the eastern corner of Belgrave Square, said an electricity box has been knocked over along with three hire bikes and one hire scooter.\n\nThere are lots of metallic looking scuffs on the pavement in the size and shape of horse shoes as well as plenty of horse dung.\n\nRoland, a worker for tour bus company, Toot Bus, said the scene was \"total mayhem\".\n\n\"I saw horses come from the bus station in front of Victoria run around in a frenzy,\" he said.\n\n\"People were running around to avoid them - it was total mayhem.\"\n\nThe runaway horses are believed to have been first spooked by the sound of nearby builders moving concrete, according to reports.\n\nThe BBC said work being carried out by builders in Belgravia caused the horses from the Household Cavalry to bolt and unseat their riders while exercising this morning.\n\nA taxi driver said he worried for his passengers when the horses narrowly avoided hitting his cab.\n\nBlack cab driver Robbie told BBC Radio London: \"I was just outside Buckingham Palace on the Mall and heard loads of galloping and looked behind and there were about three or four horses.\n\n\"Two of them were sprinting up towards Trafalgar Square and there was a white one covered in blood as well.\n\n\"I looked in the rear mirror and saw them coming right up behind me, and at the time I had two punters in the back so I was worried about them,\" he added.\n\n\"Luckily they swerved towards the middle of the road and carried on, but they were going at some speed.\"\n\nThe London Ambulance Service has said it received three horse-related calls.\n\nThe first was at 8.25am about a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nThe patient was taken to hospital.\n\nTwo minutes later medics were called to nearby Belgrave Square and found two people injured by horses and took them to hospital.\n\nA further call was made at 8.35am at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street and a fourth person was taken to hospital\n\nThe owner of a silver Mercedes-Benz people carrier has said one of the horses cut itself when it smashed into the car's windscreen.\n\nFaraz, who was picking up a client outside the Clermont Hotel by Victoria Station, told LBC that a white horse was injured from the impact.\n\nPhotos of the car show droplets of blood across its side door.\n\nHe told LBC: \"I was just sitting by the car with my passenger.. I didn't see the horse hit my car, I was like, smashed senseless, the people just came by my car to check 'are you ok'.\n\n\"It was just like a smash, his head hit it very hard and then [went] down. I saw about three, four horses, and I think it was the white horse which hit my car.\"\n\nOne horse was captured near Limehouse, east London, at least five miles from Hyde Park Barracks where the incident began.\n\nFour people have been injured in three separate locations across central London.\n\nOne soldier was heard 'screaming in pain' after he was thrown from his horse outside the Clermont Hotel in Victoria.\n\nAnother man was seen lying on the pavement in Fleet Street after two horses were pictured galloping down the road.\n\nCity of London Police said two of the escaped horses have been contained.\n\nThe force said officers were waiting for an Army horse box to collect the animals and take them to a vet.\n\nThe Household Cavalry is made up of the two most senior units in the British army: The Life Guards and The Blues & Royals.\n\nThe Regiment is divided between the operational unit, equipped with armoured vehicles, and the ceremonial mounted unit, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, garrisoned at Hyde Park Barracks in London.\n\nAll members of the Household Cavalry are taught to ride as they will rotate between the operational and ceremonial units throughout their careers.\n\nThe Mounted Regiment is often seen in public performing ceremonial duties on State and Royal occasions.\n\nDuties include the provision of a Sovereign's Escort, most commonly seen on The King's Birthday Parade (better known as 'Trooping the Colour') which takes place in June each year.\n\nThe Mounted Regiment will also take part in other occasions including state visits by visiting heads of state, royal weddings and coronations.\n\nWhilst every soldier will have been taught to ride, the uniforms worn even when exercising the horses can be heavy and restrictive making control of the horse challenging for less experienced riders.\n\nBig Bus Tours has confirmed that a horse ran into one of its parked buses. The company said none of its staff were injured.\n\nThe horse that collided with the bus was calmed by pedestrians who petted its nose and led it away from the road.\n\nTyne Marie, 19, who works for Big Bus Tours, said: \"It completely smashed the windscreen while the driver was inside.\n\n\"He was not injured but he was very shocked. Apparently they lost control of the horses in Knightsbridge.\"\n\nCsilla, an employee at a coffee shop in central London's Strand, witnessed the horses running down Fleet Street, in the direction of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n\"I saw a white horse running, he was bleeding all over his chest,\" she said.\n\n\"A few moments later I saw another horse - a black one - running after him. And then a police car went down the road after them.\"\n\nCsilla said the horses were running near the pavement and pedestrians were forced to jump out of the way to avoid injury.\n\nA witness to the incident on Buckingham Palace Road said a horse bolted across the street into a parked car before galloping away. Bystanders screamed and ran as the animal raced towards them, witnesses claimed.\n\nBashir Aden, 48, a construction worker, said: \"I saw a soldier falling down into the street after the horse ran into a car. One of my colleagues called the police.\n\n\"The man hit the floor hard, he was screaming in pain. You could see blood all over the parked car.\n\n\"The horses come down this route every day, but today the horse looked stressed or panicked. I saw the horse run away after it hit a bus. People were screaming and running all over.\"\n\nMr Aden, who lives in Canary Wharf, east London, added: \"The injuries looked very serious he looked really hurt.\"\n\nPictures show a soldier lying in the street receiving treatment outside the Clermont Hotel in Victoria.\n\nBuckingham Palace Road was closed following the incident with a cordon erected at the scene.\n\nA blue tarpaulin tent was erected while ambulance workers attended to the injured serviceman.\n\nA black horse was seen close to the incident in Victoria, and a silver Mercedes-Benz people carrier had suffered severe damage to its side panel with two of its rear windows smashed.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrave_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgrave Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancery_Lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancery Lane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fleet Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgravia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Vine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Vine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_railway_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charing Cross railway station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

Col. Matt Woodward, who is the commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment of the British Army, said in a video posted on X. \"Our immediate priority was the safety and well-being of all soldiers, members of the public, and our horses.\"\n\nWoodward said three soldiers who fell from their horses were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. He said all three soldiers involved are expected to recover fully and to return to duty.\n\nWith help from authorities, as well as the public, the horses were all returned to Hyde Park Barracks and received veterinary care.\n\nTwo of the horses underwent surgery and one was transferred to an equine hospital, the British Army posted on X.\n\nThree of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition,\" Defense Minister James Cartlidge told Sky News. \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\"\n\nCartlidge identified Vida as the white horse seen drenched in blood as it galloped down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district.\n\nVida ran alongside a black horse named Trojan that could be seen sideswiping a taxi as it turned into oncoming traffic after running through a red light at an intersection.\n\nWitnesses said they saw one of the animals crash into a taxi outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows. Another slammed into a tour bus, smashing the windshield.\n\nThe British Army said all remaining horses are being closely observed.\n\nOur horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course,\" the British Army noted on X. \"We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses. We will provide more updates soon.\"\n\nWoodward said Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment exercises about 150 horses every morning in parks and along roads to keep them in shape, as well as acclimate them to city noise \"so they are less easily panicked\" during parades and other events. He said considering \"the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare and we continue to strive to minimize the risk of this recurring.\"\n\nA day after the incident, more than 150 horses and close to 200 participants took part in the regiment's annual inspection at Hyde Park to demonstrate readiness for summer pageantry including Trooping the Color and state visits.\n\nA small crowd gathered as mounted riders, dressed in black, red and gold uniforms with golden helmets, trotted to the beat of a brass band.", "source": {"uri": "okcfox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KOKH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_a_botelho@okcfox.com", "name": "Jessica A.

In one video, a black 4\u00d74 vehicle with blue lights flashing can be seen trailing the animals.\n\nEric Church talks new Nashville bar and residency\n\n\"Blind trust\": Widow's $1.5 million romance scam story serves as cautionary tale", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Church", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Four-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2MlJLDfuANvV6mDnC8pC3w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/7d7cd97500c3dacc06901037f55eee86", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Three soldiers and one pedestrian were injured.\n\n\"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp,\" a military spokeswoman told The Washington Post. \"A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"\n\nThe horses were from the Household Cavalry, which participates in the ceremonial Changing of the Guard and major royal celebrations. These horses are selected for their temperament and are trained to remain calm while working amid chaotic crowds and unexpected noises. Throwing their riders and bolting are highly unusual.\n\nAs statements from officials and eyewitnesses rolled in Wednesday, a picture of events began to emerge.\n\nSeven horses and six soldiers from the Household Cavalry had been engaged in what's known as a \"watering order,\" which serves as both exercise and training for the sorts of sights and sounds they might encounter when on parade. They were just a day away from the Major General's Inspection, an annual test of the regiment's ability to carry out ceremonial duties for the year ahead.\n\nThe group was passing through London's Belgravia neighborhood when builders dropped a load of concrete. Four of the horses unseated their riders, and a fifth, riderless, also bolted. Two of the soldiers managed to remain mounted. Three injured soldiers were taken to a hospital to be assessed.\n\nThe horses galloped through some of London's most famous streets. A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service said the first calls, around 8:25 a.m., reported a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road and other people injured in nearby Belgrave Square. Another injury was called in at the junction of Fleet Street and Chancery Lane, known for their associations with the media and the legal profession.\n\nPhotos shared on social media showed horses running by Victoria Station, one of the city's busiest rail hubs, and along the Strand, a major thoroughfare in the heart of the capital. Their reins dangling, stirrups swinging, they wove their way around cars, bicycles and double-decker buses. One of the horses was spotted near Tower Bridge, and at least two made it to Limehouse - about five miles from Buckingham Palace.\n\nMembers of the public were filmed calming a black horse standing close to a bus with a cracked windshield.\n\nA Mercedes van's windows were also smashed. The owner of the van, identified only as Faraz, told LBC radio that he saw \"three or four\" horses and that a soldier fell off his horse. He said a white horse hit his vehicle and was left bleeding.\n\nAround 10:30 a.m., two hours after the incident began, the London Metropolitan Police said that all five horses had been \"contained.\" They were returned to their stables at Hyde Park Barracks.\n\nBashir Aden, a construction worker, told the Daily Telegraph that he saw a rider thrown after the horse ran into a car. He said one of his colleagues called the police.\n\n\"The man hit the floor hard. He was screaming in pain. You could see blood all over the parked car,\" Aden said.\n\nThe Household Cavalry is made up of the two most senior regiments of the British army. Soldiers are trained to drive and operate armored vehicles in combat situations, as well as to take part in the meticulously choreographed ceremonial events on horseback. They played a starring role at King Charles III's coronation and at Queen Elizabeth II's funeral.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors":

Unfortunately, we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing, as you said yourself, no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\n\nAmbulance crews treated four people on Wednesday in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10 minutes.\n\nThe drama began near Buckingham Palace Road where witnesses saw a serviceman thrown from his horse, and one of the loose animals crashed into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows.\n\nAnother of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windscreen.\n\nTwo horses were then seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood.\n\nJordan Pettitt, 26, who works for the PA news agency, said the grey horse was \"vividly\" stained red with blood and he heard a black horse collide with a taxi.\n\nThe animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel, before they were recaptured by City of London Police and taken away to be assessed by Army vets.", "source": {"uri":

A British Army spokesperson was not able to confirm what caused the injury.\n\nMegan Morra, who was on her way to work, told the BBC that she saw the striking image of the white horse with a head injury.\n\n\"There was a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I was a bit distressed to be honest, looking at the poor horse.\"\n\nIn a video statement on X, formerly Twitter, Matt Woodward, Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said about 150 horses are exercised every morning in parks and on the roads to keep them fit and get them used to the surroundings and the noise so they are less easily panicked during parades.\n\n\"This morning, however, a small group of horses were spooked by some construction works on a quiet side road in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them,\" he said.\n\n\"Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare,\" Woodward added.\n\nHe thanked the emergency responders and members of the public for reacting quickly.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

All the captured horses were taken back to barracks in Hyde Park.\n\nCartlidge said the army trains with about 150 horses every day, so the incident was exceptionally rare.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing ... no serious injuries to the public as far as we are aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation,\" he told LBC.\n\nThe horses had been training for an upcoming military parade and were spooked by the crashing sound of construction materials at a work site in Belgravia, a swanky neighbourhood just to the west of the palace, said Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nA day after the incident, more than 150 horses and close to 200 participants took part in the regiment's annual inspection at Hyde Park to demonstrate readiness for summer pageantry, including Trooping the Color and state visits.\n\nA small crowd gathered as mounted riders, dressed in black,

A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"\n\nBBC staff member Tony Bonsignore witnessed the incident and told BBC Radio London he saw someone receiving treatment from paramedics.\n\n\"They were treating someone behind the blue cloth. That person has been taken away in an ambulance,\" he said.\n\nMr Bonsignore was on a bus near Victoria Station when the incident unfolded, and said: \"Everything came to a standstill. Right behind us a horse hit a tour bus, and you can see where it smashed the windscreen.\n\n\"There was blood on the floor as well.\"\n\nHe added: \"I saw a horse that was being led away, it wasn't clear whether that horse had been injured.\n\n\"A sort of taxi van is pretty badly smashed up on the side, again with some blood on the floor and evidence of where horses were behind it.\"\n\n\"You can imagine those horses will be spooked,\" he continued. \"This is an incredibly busy part of London at any time of day, but especially at half-past eight in the morning.\n\n\"It's pretty grim to be honest, you can see it on the roads where it happened. It's a pretty extraordinary thing.\"\n\nSean, a taxi driver in Blackfriars, told BBC Radio London: \"I was coming out of Victoria Station, and there's a little cabbie road that comes out into Buckingham Palace Road.\n\n\"The lights turned green for me to pull out. I could hear horses hooves very loudly and quickly coming along, so nudged out of the side road and had a look and then three horses went past me at full gallop without riders.\"\n\nHe added he \"nudged out a little bit more\" to check it was safe to pull out, and then \"another horse came round the corner with a rider on it and just missed my cab and then he disappeared off\".\n\nThe \"three horses went off towards Buckingham Palace\", before \"it sounded like a car crash, so it sounded like one had been hit\", the taxi driver added.\n\nHe said as he pulled out of Buckingham Palace Road, he could seen one of the riders \"on his back being tended to\".\n\nThere was also \"a Mercedes Vito parked outside the Grosvenor Hotel with its side smashed in, covered in blood, all the windows smashed\", he continued, and another rider on the ground at Belgrave Square.\n\nHe said he could also see \"two horses with the riders intact and a female rider from the cavalry standing there sobbing her eyes out, and a black BMW with its rear window, its boot smashed in\".\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"We are aware of a number of horses that are currently loose in central London and are working with colleagues, including the Army, to locate them.\"\n\nA spokesperson for London Fire Brigade said crews had been called at 08:31 BST to \"reports of vehicles in collision with horses

At least four people have been hospitalized in the wake of the incident; users on social media have been sharing images of the blood-covered thoroughbreds crashing into cars and buses.\n\nThe incident occurred on Wednesday morning at 8:40am local time in the center of the British capital. Five horses belonging to the Household Cavalry were apparently spooked by noise coming from a construction site during their daily morning exercise on Horse Guards Parade, in Whitehall.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, a total of five people were injured during the nearly two-hour-long rampage that spanned almost ten kilometers through central London. Of the four people who have been hospitalized, three are believed to be soldiers.

It was very scary,\" another witness said, noting that \"It's rare to see horses stampeding down the street like that.\"\n\nIn some of the pictures, some members of the public could be seen trying to help calm down one of the shaken horses, whose legs could be seen covered in blood.\n\nBy 10:30am, Metropolitan Police reported that all of the horses had been caught and accounted for. After being transported to veterinary care via army horse boxes, all of the animals are reported to now be back at the army camp.\n\n\"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning.

Both animals were observed wearing saddles and bridles, with one horse appearing to have bloodstains on its chest.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police of London quickly responded to the situation, putting efforts with the army to locate and capture the runaway horses. Given the potential danger posed by the animals during busy traffic, quick action was necessary for public safety.\n\nLondon is home to several army regiments, many of which maintain stables within the city. As a result, it's not surprising to see horses around key government and ceremonial locations such as Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, The Mall, and Hyde Park.\n\nThe City of London Police, responsible for patrolling the district, received reports around 8:40 am regarding the loose horses. Taking swift action, officers managed to capture the animals, who were near Limehouse on the Highway bleeding.\n\nIn addition to the police response, efforts were made to give necessary care for the horses. An Army horse box was arranged to transport the animals to veterinary facilities for any required treatment.\n\nAccording to accounts from The Daily Telegraph, the chaotic situation took place as several army horses threw their riders while being exercised. Regrettably, at least one soldier was heavily injured during the incident.", "source": {"uri": "albawaba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Bawaba"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mall,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mall, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City of London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "City of London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2024-04/shutterstock_2219584009.jpg?itok=SBvHSx0n", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

A fifth horse tried to bolt but couldn't break free.\n\n\"Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition,\" defense minister James Cartlidge told Sky News. \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\"\n\nThree soldiers thrown from their steeds were hospitalized with injuries, but were expected to fully recover and return to work.\n\nThe British Army said three of the horses were expected to return to duty, but the fate of the two with the worst injuries was unclear.\n\nNeither was believed to have broken bones, but a horse named Quaker was transferred to an equine hospital for specialist care, an army spokesperson said.\n\nVida, a white horse seen drenched in blood as it galloped down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district, was treated for lacerations.\n\n\"Vida was the most visibly injured and the pictures of the horse running through London soaked in blood were horrifying,\" the army said in a statement.\n\nThe other loose horses from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London, are named Trojan and Tennyson.\n\nDuring the wild spectacle captured by stunned commuters and shared on social media, the horses had near misses with cyclists and a rider on a motorbike at a traffic light.\n\nVida ran alongside Trojan, a black horse that could be seen sideswiping a taxi as it turned into oncoming traffic after running through a red light at an intersection.\n\nOne of the animals shattered the windows of a taxi it struck outside the Clermont Hotel and another smashed a windshield when it slammed into a tour bus.\n\nTwo of the horses were corralled at Limehouse about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from where they bolted. All the captured horses were taken back to barracks in Hyde Park.\n\nCartlidge said the army trains with about 150 horses every day, so the incident was exceptionally rare.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing ... no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation,\" he told LBC.\n\nThe horses had been training for an upcoming military parade and were spooked by the crashing sound of construction materials at a work site in Belgravia, a swanky neighborhood just to the west of the palace, said Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nA day after the incident, more than 150 horses and close to 200 participants took part in the regiment's annual inspection at Hyde Park to demonstrate readiness for summer pageantry including Trooping the Color and state visits.\n\nA small crowd gathered as mounted riders, dressed in black, red and gold uniforms with golden helmets, trotted to the beat of a brass band.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the black horse seen running with a bloody horse was named Trojan, not Quaker.",

The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment have issued a statement following dramatic scenes this morning, where horses were photographed galloping down the streets of the city, with one visibly covered in blood.\n\nIn a video statement posted on X, Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment Lieutenant Colonel Matt Woodward said the unit exercises around 150 horses on the roads and in parks every morning, partly to help desensitise them to city noise. He said a small group of horses were spooked by construction work on a side road in Belgravia.\n\nLt Col Woodward said: \"This morning, however, a small group of horses were spooked by some construction works on a quiet side road in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them. The ensuing shock caused all horses to bolt and unseated some riders.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Watch the moment armed robber points gun at shopkeeper's head before fleeing with cash drawer\n\nFour soldiers were thrown from their saddles in the ensuing chaos, and five horses became loose, the Press Association has reported. The horses then smashed into vehicles, causing several injuries.\n\nLieut Col Woodward said the four service personnel were receiving treatment in hospital. Ambulance crews treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10 minutes.\n\nA management consultant from South London who saw two of the horses galloping near Aldwych said the sight was \"gruesome\" and \"like a weird dream\". The 28-year-old said: \"I got off the 172 bus which ends at Aldwych and two horses went flying past. One black, one white.\n\n\"The white one was drenched in blood from the chest down and they were galloping through the traffic at speed. People were stopping in the street shocked. The horses were running into fast-moving traffic and seemed terrified. Some unmarked police cars were chasing after them, which didn't seem to be helping.\n\n\"I felt shocked. It was pretty gruesome. Felt like a weird dream.\"\n\nThe drama began near Buckingham Palace Road where witnesses saw a serviceman thrown from his horse, and one of the loose animals crashed into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering the windows.\n\nThe pair of horses was finally captured on the Highway near Limehouse, more than five miles from where they first bolted.\n\nAfter thanking the emergency services and the public for their help, Lt Col Woodward added: \"Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare, we continue to strive to minimise the risk of this recurring. As ever we are grateful for due consideration given by the members of the public to not making loud noises around our horses.\"\n\nThe animals are all receiving care from vets at Hyde Park barracks.\n\nGot a story for us?

These horses undergo rigorous training for several months to acclimate them to the bustling streets of London, including exposure to heavy traffic and loud noises such as gun salutes and military bands. Each horse is typically assigned to a specific soldier.\n\nThe commotion began when noise from a nearby building site in Belgravia startled the horses, causing them to bolt and unseat their riders. The horses, which belong to the Household Cavalry, were preparing for an inspection ahead of rehearsals for the King's birthday parade scheduled for June. As they raced through central London, they collided with traffic at various locations, with some running as far as Limehouse in east London.\n\nThe aftermath of the incident left four people hospitalized and numerous vehicles damaged. Witnesses described scenes of \"total mayhem,\" with horses racing through the streets and colliding with cars and buses. Two horses, still wearing saddles, were captured on camera galloping down Aldwych, followed closely by an unmarked police car.\n\nOne of the injured servicemen was found near Buckingham Palace Road, while another horse crashed into a taxi outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows and leaving blood stains. Emergency services rushed to the scene to attend to the injured and contain the situation.\n\nReports indicate that as many as seven horses from the Household Cavalry were involved in the incident. Some were spotted galloping past landmarks like Aldwych House in Holborn and Tower Bridge, causing pedestrians to flee in fear. Witnesses described seeing horses running with blood on their chests, indicating injuries sustained during the chaos.\n\nCity authorities and emergency services worked swiftly to contain the situation, with officers successfully capturing two runaway horses near Limehouse. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that all the horses had been \"accounted for\" and were being returned to camp. However, the incident raised concerns about the safety of both riders and pedestrians in central London.\n\nWhile the horses have since been recovered, questions remain about the circumstances leading to their escape and the welfare of those involved. The incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of working with animals in urban environments and the need for stringent safety measures to prevent such occurrences in the future.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anas_bouargane@bbntimes.com", "name": "Anas Bouargane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgravia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tower Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holborn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holborn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holborn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage,_Hay,_and_Sleigh_Rides", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage, Hay, and Sleigh Rides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Chaos_Ensues_as_Household_Cavalry_Horses_Bolt_Through_Londons_Streets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

At least four people have been hospitalized in the wake of the incident; users on social media have been sharing images of the blood-covered thoroughbreds crashing into cars and buses.\n\nThe incident occurred on Wednesday morning at 8:40am local time in the center of the British capital. Five horses belonging to the Household Cavalry were apparently spooked by noise coming from a construction site during their daily morning exercise on Horse Guards Parade, in Whitehall.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, a total of five people were injured during the nearly two-hour-long rampage that spanned almost ten kilometers through central London. Of the four people who have been hospitalized, three are believed to be soldiers. None of the people who were hurt are reported to have sustained any life-threatening injuries.\n\nOne eyewitness recalled seeing one of the riders \"screaming in pain\" after he fell off his steed as it struck a car near the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road.\n\n\"'I saw a soldier falling down into the street after the horse ran into a car,\" the witness told The Telegraph. \"The man hit the floor hard, he was screaming in pain. You could see blood all over the parked car.\"\n\nPhotos and videos shared online also show one of the horses ramming into a double-decker bus and smashing its windshield; another was seen crashing into a black taxicab. The frightened animals continued to run through the streets covered in blood after apparently being cut by the broken glass.\n\n\"They were running down the street at a very high speed. It was very scary,\" another witness said, noting that \"It's rare to see horses stampeding down the street like that.\"\n\nIn some of the pictures, some members of the public could be seen trying to help calm down one of the shaken horses, whose legs could be seen covered in blood.\n\nBy 10:30am, Metropolitan Police reported that all of the horses had been caught and accounted for. After being transported to veterinary care via army horse boxes, all of the animals are reported to now be back at the army camp.\n\n\"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp,\" an army spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the horses and personnel who were injured in the incident were \"receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Guards_Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse Guards Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-decker_bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-decker bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.04/article/662916f785f5402a8f6e1edd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

A fifth horse that tried to bolt hadn't been able to break free.\n\nTwo of the horses underwent operations and one was transferred to an equine hospital, the British Army posted on X.\n\n\"Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition,\" defense minister James Cartlidge told Sky News. \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\"\n\nThree soldiers thrown from their steeds were hospitalized with injuries, but were expected to fully recover and return to duty.\n\nThe loose horses from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London, were named as Vida, Quaker, Trojan and Tennyson.\n\nCartlidge identified Vida as the white horse seen drenched in blood as it galloped down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district.\n\nVida ran alongside a black horse named Quaker that could be seen sideswiping a taxi as it turned into oncoming traffic after running through a red light at an intersection.\n\nDuring the wild spectacle captured by stunned commuters and shared on social media, the horses had near misses with cyclists and a rider on a motorbike at a traffic light.\n\nWitnesses saw one of the animals crash into a taxi outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows. Another slammed into a tour bus, smashing the windshield.\n\nTwo of the horses were corralled at Limehouse about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from where they bolted. All the captured horses were taken back to barracks in Hyde Park.\n\nCartlidge said the army trains with about 150 horses every day, so the incident was exceptionally rare.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing ... no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we will be keeping an eye on the situation,\" he told LBC.\n\nThe horses had been training for an upcoming military parade and were spooked by the crashing sound of construction materials at a work site in Belgravia, a swanky neighborhood just to the west of the palace, said Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nA day after the incident, more than 150 horses and close to 200 participants took part in the regiment's annual inspection at Hyde Park to demonstrate readiness for summer pageantry including Trooping the Color and state visits.\n\nA small crowd gathered as mounted riders, dressed in black, red and gold uniforms with golden helmets, trotted to the beat of a brass band.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A horse was filmed rearing and throwing off a trooper on the same day a group of panicked horses ran wild through Central London.\n\nThe man filming is heard saying moments before the incident: 'The horses are having a bit of a dance show this morning, they're not settling down as quick as they usually do.' Seconds later, the footage shows commotion among the crowd as a black horse appears unsettled and moves in a frantic manner. Several of the horses are seen tugging against their harnesses, disturbed by the distressed animal, as the first horse bucks and throws the rider off.\n\nThe man filming then says: 'Oh a trooper has been thrown, oh good lord' as he runs forward. The horse is then seen walking away from the rider - lying motionless on the floor - with an empty saddle. The man added: 'What is going on with the horses today?' Footage shows the other riders trying to control and calm their steeds.\n\nThe thrown rider is then seen beginning to move as police come to check if he is okay. A woman is heard in the background urging the members of the public to remain still, as a soldier is seen running frantically into the area to try and capture the riderless horse. As the animals get back into formation, they still seem distressed and toss their heads. A medic raced to treat the rider, surrounded by other military personnel and police officers as he lay on the floor.\n\nIn a heartwarming show of support, the gathered crowd applauds as the wounded rider manages to get to his feet. It's unclear if this happened before or after the incident at 8.20am this morning which led to the animals fleeing through busy city streets in a panic.\n\nFive horses threw off their riders and ran amok after being spooked by building works. Horses slammed into a tour bus parked on Buckingham Palace Road and a taxi outside the Clermont Hotel - smashing their windows - before two were seen running through Aldwych with their chests covered in blood.\n\nThe horses rampaged for six miles before they were finally caught in Limehouse, east London. The injured horses saw a vet and all of the animals are now back with the Army. A British Army spokesperson confirmed this afternoon that the animals were 'spooked by construction works' when building materials were 'dropped from a height'.\n\nSix soldiers and seven horses from the Life Guards were on an extended Watering Order, an exercise to keep up the fitness of animals not involved in the public-facing King's Life Guard duties. Onlookers said one of the Household Cavalry soldiers was left 'screaming in pain' after he was thrown from his horse when it struck a car by the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road, Victoria.\n\nFootage of two horses being caught outside Gordon House on the Glamis Estate in Limehouse, east London, appeared to show that the white horse had broken its leg. Still drenched in blood, the horse's back left leg was bandaged and the animal seemed unwilling to walk on it.\n\nHeld at the side of the road by several officers, the white horse bled all over the road and was treated by vets at the scene. Footage shows it bleeding profusely from its back leg as police gathered around to stem the flow.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Three of them were hospitalized with injuries. None of them were deemed to be life-threatening.\n\nThe horses -- minus their riders -- then ran through main roads in central London, hitting vehicles and stunning commuters as they headed to work. The horses were all captured shortly after and are back at the barracks in Hyde Park undergoing medical tests.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Another of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windshield.\n\nPictures and videos shared widely across social media show two of the horses -- one white, one black -- running at speed down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district.\n\nThe white horse's face and legs were soaked in blood. A British Army spokesperson was not able to confirm what caused the injury.\n\nMegan Morra, who was on her way to work, told the BBC that she saw the striking image of the white horse with a head injury.\n\n\"There was a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I was a bit distressed to be honest, looking at the poor horse.\"\n\nThe horses are from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London.\n\nThe extent of the injuries the horses suffered were not immediately known.\n\nIn a video statement on X, formerly Twitter, Matt Woodward, Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said around 150 horses are exercised every morning in parks and on the roads to keep them fit and get them used to the surroundings and the noise so they are less easily panicked during parades.\n\n\"This morning, however, a small group of horses were spooked by some construction works on a quiet side road in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them,\" he said.\n\n\"Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare,\" Woodward added., He thanked the emergency responders and members of the public for reacting quickly.\n\n\"This enabled swift treatment of our soldiers and helped bring our injured horses to safety,\" he added.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service said it treated four people across three separate incidents in the space of 10 minutes after the incident erupted around 8:30 a.m.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

They have all been recovered. Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition,\" the defence minister James Cartlidge told Sky News this morning.\n\nNow The Horses Trust has volunteered to rescue the injured pair, who are thought to have been \"spooked by builders\" while having their morning exercise, with the charity adding that they have many retired military horses\" residing at their sanctuary already.\n\nJessica Tallman, Director of Fundraising and Communications, told The Independent: \"If the decision was made for them not to return to work, we would always welcome them into the care of our charity.\n\n\"The Horse Trust are experts in research and the care of service horses, and we have many retired military horses residing at our sanctuary.\"\n\nThe Independent has put this offer to the Household Cavalry directly.\n\nThe revelation comes after Redwings Horse Sanctuary explained why the situation, which required two of the horses to be operated on, may have escalated so quickly.\n\n\"The incident that spooked those horses must have been fairly dramatic for them to have taken off like that,\" Nic De Brauwere, Head of Behaviour, at the charity told The Independent.\n\n\"When horses are in flight or fight mode, they will continue to run away from what they think could be a dangerous situation until they feel calm enough to relax.\n\n\"I imagine that they probably felt disorientated when they started to calm down and they didn't have a solution as to how to find their way back home until they were caught.\n\n\"They probably would have known how to get back to the barracks and walked to that place if they were along their normal route. Horses are pretty good at recognising where they are,\n\n\"But in the heat of the moment, they quite possibly went off on a route they'd never been down before.\"\n\nWhile a petition has now been created to retire the horses to a sanctuary following the incident, De Brauwere said that it is too early to say whether or not that will be necessary.\n\nHe admitted: \"I can understand that people would think maybe the horses would want to put their feet up and retire as they may be traumatised from it, but it's really too early to tell.\n\n\"I have no doubt that they will be in the best of hands.\n\n\"If they [recover physically and] can't cope going back into a formal environment gradually, that's when I think the decision can be made [that] they need to stop working.\"\n\n\"Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course,\" the British army said in a statement on Twitter (X).\n\n\"We want to thank everyone who has shown such kindness and concern towards our soldiers and horses. We will provide more updates soon.\"\n\nAn RSPCA spokesperson told The Independent: \"We wish all the horses and people injured in this sad and shocking episode a very speedy recovery - particularly those which have undergone surgery.\n\n\"It's heartening to see the deep levels of care and concern people have expressed for these horses and their riders.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cartlidge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Cartlidge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwings_Horse_Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redwings Horse Sanctuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Horse Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barracks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/25/11/0d0326b21352d50f409daa42def64defY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE0MTI1MTkz-2.75974089.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

London: 'nothing cruel'", "body": "A horse charity boss from Buckinghamshire has defended Household Cavalry horses after four horses were on the loose in central London yesterday (April 24).\n\nJeanette Allen, the head of The Horse Trust based in Princes Risborough, insists there's \"nothing cruel\" about their training methods following an unsettling incident where several horses threw their riders off and rampaged across six miles.\n\nIn an interview with Good Morning Britain this morning (April 25) Allen debunked the idea of mistreatment, assuring that the occurrence was nothing but a \"one-off.\"\n\nShe said: \"All the service horses that come here to retire are still really happy to work with really strong bonds with their riders.\n\n\"99.9 per cent of the time no incidents like this ever happen.\"\n\nShedding light on why such mishaps can happen, she elaborated that horses are a prey and herd animal, programmed naturally to sense danger and act on it.\n\n\"With all the training in the world, you can't predict.\n\n\"They are very big horses, with enormous amounts of adrenaline running through them at that point,\" she explained.\n\nDue to their large size, an average of 550 to 750 kg each, she mentioned that it's challenging for them to turn quickly when panicked.\n\nAs a result, she said members of the public did the right thing remaining distant as these are \"dangerous animals.\"\n\nAllen praised the police saying they \"acted appropriately\" by letting the horses slow down due to fatigue.\n\nNow, she anticipates that these horses, back at Hyde Park barracks, will receive the best care from their outstanding vet team in a calm environment.\n\nTwo horses were then seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood.\n\nJordan Pettitt, 26, who works for the PA news agency, said the grey horse was \"vividly\" stained red with blood and he heard a black horse collide with a taxi.\n\nThe animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel, before they were recaptured by City of London Police and taken away to be assessed by Army vets.", "source": {"uri": "bucksfreepress.co.uk", "dataType":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPanicked one-tonne cavalry horses threw off their army riders before smashing into a tour bus and taxis, leaving a 5-mile-long bloody trail in their wake through the city of London.\n\nPolice followed two of the five Household Cavalry Mounted regiment horses for more than five miles as tourists fled in terror to escape their path of destruction, while the other three were quickly caught.\n\nThe drama began near Buckingham Palace Road at 8am where witnesses saw a serviceman thrown from his horse after falling concrete spooked the animals whilst on an exercise session.\n\nThree soldiers were left injured before one of the loose animals crashed into a taxi shattering the windows.\n\nWorkers near the Clermont Hotel in central London described the \"total mayhem\" when the horses galloped through the packed street in morning rush hour.\n\nRoland, a worker for tour bus company, Toot Bus, said: \"I saw horses come from the bus station in front of Victoria run around in a frenzy.\n\n\"People were running around to avoid them - it was total mayhem.\"\n\nDarren Brookes, a site manager, who was working opposite the four-star hotel in Victoria, told The Independent: \"They ran past us towards hotel, and smashed into a van parked outside.\n\n\"The serviceman was thrown off the white horse and hit the ground with a massive bang. He was shouting in pain.\n\n\"Everyone at the bus stop outside the hotel started screaming and shouting - there was so much panic.\n\n\"People ran over to help the fallen soldier, but other people were just too scared and were running away.\n\nMr Brookes said the serviceman was on the ground for about 30 minutes before paramedics took him to the hospital.\n\n\"The black horse then ran into a tour bus and smashed the windscreen,\" he added.\n\n\"That's when I saw the blood - the horse was cut across its chest.\n\n\"I could see the blood everywhere. It was on the bus and the van.\"\n\nThe two horses were then seen running in the road near Aldwych with medics called two minutes later to Belgrave Square surrounded by Grade I-listed international embassy buildings.\n\nThe bolting horses ploughed through an electricity box and destroyed multiple rental bikes left near the 19th-century garden square.\n\nOne of the damaged bikes was covered in blood which dripped onto the walkway beneath it.\n\nA witness in Belgrave Square told The Independent: \"There was horse blood all over the bikes and the pavement. I saw the white horse run past covered in blood.\n\n\"It all happened in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nAmbulance crews treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10 minutes.\n\nThe pair fled in fear down the Strand, past the Tower of London storming through traffic and onto the congested Highway at Limehouse, more than five miles from where they first bolted.\n\nThe adrenaline-fuelled chase came to an end with the white horse struggling to move its badly injured leg as it bled heavily on the pavement of the dual carriageway.\n\nOne gas engineer saw the soldiers try and lead the white horse into the back of a horsebox after police finally caught up to them at 8.55am.\n\nSoldiers in camouflage were seen stroking the horses' faces and talking to them in a bid to soothe the pair and get them safely back to their base in a mobile horse box.\n\nThe engineer told The Independent: \"We heard police sirens then saw the officers stopping the traffic. We saw blood all over the horses. It was heartbreaking to see a one-tonne horse like that in so much pain.\n\n\"I used to own horses. He was holding his leg up - that is telling you it is painful in some way.\n\n\"With leg damage on the horse, it will not heal. If a tendon is broken he will be put down. Horses are very sensitive to any damage to the leg.\n\n\"I love horses. A beautiful horse like that, he needs to be run. If he just sits and eats he goes crazy. And then when he goes and gets frightened he runs even more.\n\nHe added: \"It is so upsetting. If a one-tonne horse is in London however much he is run that is only a quarter of how much exercise he should get otherwise he goes ballistic.\n\n\"I hope he is going to be alright but I don't think he will be.\"\n\nTom Cahill, 21, saw the injured horse struggling in pain as police closed The Highway to traffic an hour after they escaped.\n\nHe told The Independent: \"The army were trying to calm it down. It is nuts how it ran all the way from Buckingham Palace through the traffic lights to here.\n\n\"I have never seen something like it before. All the blood is just being cleaned up now.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't think horses like that should be in London, it's too busy. Back in the day people would drive slowly around them but now no-one cares.\n\n\"It is just really sad. I don't think horses should be on the streets. They are so aware of what is happening.\"\n\nOne street cleaner tasked with cleaning up the large pool of blood said it was the worst thing he had seen since the Vauxhall helicopter crash in 2013 which claimed the lives of two people.\n\nHe told The Independent: \"It is the strangest job I have been called to in a long time. It's crazy you don't expect it.\n\n\"The last big accident I can remember working on like this is the Vauxhall air disaster that was the last major thing.\n\n\"Every day is different in this job. When we got here there was lots of horse manure and blood it was a horrid mess.\n\n\"Of course we hope the horse is ok. But if its leg is broken that is it for him, sadly.\"\n\nThe two street cleaners flagged down a passing fire engine who offered to hose down the large pool of blood left behind.\n\nHe added: \"We had to ask the firefighters to give us a hand otherwise we would be here until dark.\"\n\nAn Army spokesman said: \"A number of military working horses became loose during routine exercise this morning. All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp.\n\n\"A number of personnel and horses have been injured and are receiving the appropriate medical attention.\"", "source": {"uri":

Four successfully broke loose and spread out across the city.\n\nOne of the horses struck a taxi with a passenger inside, leaving an enormous dent and shattering several of the vehicle's windows.\n\nOthers smashed into a parked tourist bus and bumped into cabs and private cars.\n\nVida and Quaker were finally caught, much later, in Limehouse in east London - nearly 10 kilometres from where they set off.\n\nThe white horse, Vida, is said to have a history of being spooked and, reportedly, kicked a soldier in the head during the King's Coronation last May.\n\nAnimal rights organisations have spoken out about the shocking incident, saying the animals have no place in military roles in modern society.\n\n\"Horses are sensitive and become spooked easily, so forcing them to partake in drills, whether ceremonial or for crowd control, can upset them deeply,\" PETA's Vice President of Programmes Elisa Allen tells Euronews Green.\n\n\"Horses don't choose to be fitted with bits and reins, subjected to loud noises, or used to carry humans on their backs,\" she adds.\n\n\"Images of blood-soaked horses running, scared, through the streets should serve as a stark reminder that animals are not military equipment and that it's high time the Ministry of Defence put its use of sentient beings out to pasture.\"\n\nThe British Army has rebutted criticism, though. \"Our horses receive the highest standards of care, and those that did not undergo surgery are expected to return to duty in due course,\" it stated on X - formerly Twitter.\n\nBritish defence minister James Cartlidge told radio station LBC the affair was a shock to all involved, emphasising that it was an \"exceptional situation\".\n\n\"You are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day,\" Cartlidge said. \"So this is extremely unlikely, this scenario.\"\n\nThe minister added that, although there were no serious injuries among the public, two of the three cavalry officers who were hurt in the incident are still in hospital under observation.\n\nOne of the soldiers was discharged overnight and the others are said to be in a stable condition. All are expected to \"recover fully and return to duty\", according to the Ministry of Defence.\n\nCartlidge said he was glad there were no serious injuries, but said the ministry will be \"keeping an eye on the situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barracks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cartlidge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Cartlidge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronews", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euronews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/39/77/64/1200x675_cmsv2_85d8c93d-46cb-5302-9d60-f012b0f73456-8397764.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The horses were all captured shortly after and are back at the barracks in Hyde Park undergoing medical tests.\n\nWitnesses saw one of the loose animals crashing into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel nearby, shattering windows. Another of the animals crashed into a tour bus, smashing the windshield.\n\nPictures and videos shared widely across social media show two of the horses -- one white, one black -- running at speed down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district.\n\nThe white horse's face and legs were soaked in blood. A British Army spokesperson was not able to confirm what caused the injury.\n\nMegan Morra, who was on her way to work, told the BBC that she saw the striking image of the white horse with a head injury.\n\n\"There was a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I was a bit distressed to be honest, looking at the poor horse.\"\n\nThe horses are from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London.\n\nThe extent of the injuries the horses suffered were not immediately known.\n\nIn a video statement on X, formerly Twitter, Matt Woodward, Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said around 150 horses are exercised every morning in parks and on the roads to keep them fit and get them used to the surroundings and the noise so they are less easily panicked during parades.\n\n\"This morning, however, a small group of horses were spooked by some construction works on a quiet side road in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them,\" he said.\n\n\"Thankfully, considering the frequency of exercise and numbers of horses involved, this type of incident is extremely rare,\" Woodward added., He thanked the emergency responders and members of the public for reacting quickly.\n\n\"This enabled swift treatment of our soldiers and helped bring our injured horses to safety,\" he added.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service said it treated four people across three separate incidents in the space of 10 minutes after the incident erupted around 8:30 a.m.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A fifth horse also tried to break free but wasn't able to escape.\n\nOn Thursday, a UK official reported that two of the creatures were in serious condition after undergoing operations.\n\nTwo of the horses underwent operations and one was transferred to an equine hospital, according to a post by the British Army on X.\n\nThe stallions that broke loose from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London, were named Vida, Quaker, Trojan, and Tennyson.\n\nThree soldiers thrown from their steeds were also hospitalized with injuries, but were expected to fully recover and return to their duties.\n\nAs the incident ensued, commuters captured the chaos on their phones and shared on social media, while the horses almost collided with cyclists and a rider on a motorbike at a traffic light.\n\nWitnesses reported they saw one of the horses crash into a taxi outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering windows. Another slammed into a tour bus, breaking the windshield.\n\nCartlidge identified Vida as the white horse seen drenched in blood as it galloped down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district. Alongside Vida was Quaker, who was seen sideswiping a taxi as they ran into oncoming traffic after galloping through a red light at an intersection.\n\nTwo of the horses were corralled at Limehouse about 5 miles from where they initially ran. All of the captured horses were taken back to barracks in Hyde Park.\n\nIn response to the incident, several animal rights organizations, including PETA, have spoken out against keeping horses in captivity, arguing the animals have no place in military roles anymore.\n\n\"Images of blood-soaked horses running, scared, through the streets should serve as a stark reminder that animals are not military equipment and that it's high time the Ministry of Defence put its use of sentient beings out to pasture,\" PETA's Vice President of Programs, Elisa Allen, reported to Euronews Green.",

Four people were treated for injuries, including a soldier who was thrown from one of the horses, according to the London ambulance service.The horses, which belong to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, a unit that parades in royal pageants, are normally well-trained symbols of London's regal past.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, they broke into a panicked stampede that had more in common with the Wild West. Galloping past some of London's most famous sites - from Buckingham Palace to Tower Bridge - they left a trail of damaged vehicles and shocked pedestrians, some of whom had to dart out of their way.\n\nBy 10.30am, the Metropolitan Police said all the horses had been recovered and were back in their barracks in Hyde Park. But some had suffered injuries, including a white horse that had blood splashed on its neck, chest and forelimbs. The drama began shortly after 8am when the horses, apparently spooked by the noise from a nearby construction site, threw off the military riders who were taking them out for routine exercises. Photos showed one of the soldiers being treated while lying on the ground on Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nVideo footage captured a pair of riderless horses galloping in Aldwych, a stately area in central London. Their hooves clattered in the shadow of grand stone buildings as passers-by scattered, buses jerked to a stop and cars honked. The white horse, wearing a saddle and stirrups with its reins flying behind it, was caught on video later galloping in the vicinity of Tower Bridge. Other pictures showed the result of unexpected encounters between animals and a busy urban landscape: a double-decker tour bus with a smashed windshield and a gray Mercedes van with a dented door and smashed rear windows.\n\nAs the incident unfolded, the media began carrying live coverage, briefly riveting much of the city. Shortly before 10am, the London police reported that its officers had corralled two of the horses near Limehouse, a neighbourhood adjacent to the city's docklands. That indicated they had made their way across Central London, from Westminster through Covent Garden and past the financial district.\n\nMegan Morra, who was on her way to work, told BBC that she saw one of the horses had a head injury. \"There was a lot of blood. I was a bit distressed looking at the poor horse.\" The horses are trained to be comfortable in busy streets and around people, which made the episode extraordinarily unusual.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry_Mounted_Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tower Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barracks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aldwych"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirrup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stirrup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Docklands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Docklands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-decker_bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-decker bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central business district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covent_Garden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Covent Garden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Covent Garden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Training", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109576696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-950515,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Whether they will recover enough to return to official duties, it's too early to know for sure.\n\n\"But they've been given the best veterinary treatment possible and remain under close supervision.\n\n\"Vida was the most visibly injured, and the pictures of the horse running through London soaked in blood were horrifying. Vida was operated on overnight and is currently in stables at the Hyde Park Barracks under observation.\n\n\"Quaker was also operated on overnight, but it was decided to move the horse to an equine hospital in the early hours for more specialist treatment. The extent of the injuries is not completely clear, but we don't believe at this stage there are any broken bones. The blood seen on Vida was consistent with lacerations.\"\n\nAn Army source told The Sun that Vida was \"lively\" and had a history of being spooked. The horse is thought to have kicked a soldier in the head during the King's Coronation.\n\nThe spooking of the four horses coincided with a separate incident on Wednesday when another horse from the Household Cavalry was filmed rearing and throwing off a trooper during exercises on Horse Guards Parade\n\nA man filming is heard saying shortly before the incident: \"The horses are having a bit of a dance show this morning, they're not settling down as quick as they usually do.\"\n\nSeconds later, there is commotion among the crowd as a black horse appears unsettled and moves in a frantic manner. Several of the horses are seen tugging against their harnesses as the first horse bucks and throws the rider off.\n\nThe man filming then says: \"Oh a trooper has been thrown. What is going on with the horses today?\"\n\nAs a medic tended the fallen rider, his colleagues tried to calm their own steeds. Moments later, the crowd applauded as the fallen rider managed to get to his feet.\n\nIn the rush-hour incident, four pedestrians were injured after the horses careered through the streets, smashing into vehicles including a Mercedes-Benz people carrier.\n\nThe horses had initially been spooked by the noise of concrete being shifted by builders at a property in Belgravia.\n\nLt Col Matt Woodward, Commanding Officer, Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, later said: \"A small group of horses were spooked by construction work in a quiet side street in Belgravia where building materials were dropped from height right next to them.\"\n\nAfter bolting into Wilton Crescent, the horses ran to Belgrave Square, leaving hoof marks in the tarmac and damaging parked hire bikes and an electricity junction box.\n\nIn total, ambulance crews treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street in the

Per The Telegraph, at least one soldier was hurt after one of the five horses hit cars outside the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service and the Metropolitan Police didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE.\n\nA black cab driver named Robbie recalled seeing one of the horses covered in blood. \"I was just outside Buckingham Palace on the Mall and heard loads of galloping and looked behind and there were about three or four horses,\" he told BBC Radio London.\n\n\"Two of them were sprinting up towards Trafalgar Square and there was a white one covered in blood as well,\" Robbie added.\n\n\"I looked in the rear mirror and saw them coming right up behind me, and at the time I had two punters (passengers) in the back so I was worried about them,\" he continued. \"Luckily they swerved towards the middle of the road and carried on, but they were going at some speed.\"\n\nRobbie said, \"Nobody knew what was going on because there wasn't any police presence or anyone chasing the horses. We knew something had happened because they both had saddle gear on. I was worried about the horse because it looked like it was injured quite badly.\"\n\nImages also showed damage done to a Big Bus Tours vehicle.

And did I mention they're pretty big? There's nothing more terrifying than clinging on for dear life to a bolting cavalry horse.\n\nThe sight of the white horse, probably an officers or bandsman, covered in blood was pretty upsetting though, for one simple reason.\n\nMy horse, ridden by Trooper Smith as I was recovering from appendicitis, was killed in the Hyde Park bombing in 1982 along with seven others and four of my colleagues, including my troop leader, some of whom I had chatted to just hours earlier.\n\nSeeing the damage the nail bombs did to their cuirasses, boots helmets made you realise how badly the poor horses must have suffered.\n\nA less horrific bolting, but no less frightening one, came during Charles and Diana's wedding.\n\nA friend of mine, who later turned out to be an adept conman stealing ceremonial kit and selling it to unscrupulous antique dealers, but that's another story, was unseated by his horse and preceded to bolt all along the parade.

A fifth horse that tried to bolt had not been able to break free. Two of the horses required operations and one was transferred to an equine hospital, the British Army said on X, the social media platform. \"Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition,\" defense minister James Cartlidge told Sky News. \"They are in a serious condition, but as I understand, still alive.\" Three of soldiers thrown from their steeds were hospitalized with injuries, but were expected to fully recover and return to duty.\n\nThe loose horses from the Household Cavalry, the ceremonial guard of the monarch and a feature of state functions in London, were named as Vida, Trojan, Quaker and Tennyson. Cartlidge identified Vida as the white horse seen drenched in blood as it ran at speed down Aldwych, in between London's historic financial center and the busy West End theater district more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) from where it bolted.

a red light at an intersection.\n\nThe horses were all captured shortly after and were taken back to barracks in Hyde Park.\n\nCartlidge said the army trains with about 150 horses every day, so the incident was exceptionally rare.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have seen what has happened, but all I can say is the crucial thing ... no serious injuries to the public as far as we aware, and of course we

All of the horses have now been recovered and returned to camp,\" a British army spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n[...]\n\nThe horses belong to the Household Cavalry, which acts as the British monarch's official bodyguard and takes part in ceremonial duties. They are garrisoned at Hyde Park barracks, less than a mile away from Buckingham Palace.\n\nA number of prestigious army regiments have stables in the British capital and horses are a regular sight around government buildings on Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, The Mall and in nearby Hyde Park. The\n\nFive people, including a soldier who was riding on of the horses, were injured in three separate incidents during the six-mile rampage on Wednesday that lasted two hours.\n\nFour people were hospitalised. It is understood that three of them are soldiers who have not sustained life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe Household Cavalry soldier was left 'screaming in pain' after he was thrown from his horse when it struck a car by the Clermont Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road, Victoria.\n\nCommuters said they heard the soldier screaming in pain after they saw him fall from his horse when the animal ran into a car.\n\nThe horses were spooked during their daily morning exercise on Horse Guards Parade, in Whitehall, at around 8.40am.\n\nOne of the horses has also seemingly ran into a double-decker bus, smashing its windscreen, while another reportedly crashed into a black cab.\n\nEmergency services rushed to the help the injured soldier, who was seen being treated on the road.\n\nBashir Aden, 48, a construction worker, told The Telegraph: 'I saw a soldier falling down into the street after the horse ran into a car. One of my colleagues called the police.\n\n'The man hit the floor hard, he was screaming in pain. You could see blood all over the parked car.'\n\nA silver Mercedes-Benz people carrier was also hit by another horse, with damage to its side and two rear windows broken.Buckingham Palace Road was closed after the shocking incident and a cordon was put in place.\n\nA blue tarpaulin tent has been put up around the injured soldier.\n\nThe horses ran through the streets of Victoria and got as far east as Aldwych before they were calmed and contained by police on the Highway near Limehouse.\n\nOfficers are now waiting for Army horseboxes to take the animals away.\n\nA woman who saw the horse crash into the Mercedes told LBC: 'One of the horses hit the Mercedes van and the rider was on it, fell back on this little middle bit of the road and the other woman lost control of her horse and she managed to grab the railings.\n\n'The horses were injured obviously from the glasses that they had broken. [The injured soldier] was laying there on the ground. He looked like he hurt himself pretty bad. It was terrible.'\n\nThe horses were all caught and accounted for by 10.30am, the Met Police said.\n\nThe Met Police said: 'We are aware of a number of horses that are currently loose in central London and are working with colleagues, including the Army, to locate them.'\n\nThe City of London Police said: 'At around 8.40am, we were called about horses that had became loose and were travelling through the City.\n\n'Our officers have contained two horses on the Highway near Limehouse. We're waiting for an Army horse box to collect the horses and transport them to veterinary care.'\n\nLondon Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 8.25am today to reports of a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road, SW1W. Oddly, the horse incident occurred today at 8:25am, and 35 minutes\n\nTeams drafted in to fix Big Ben clock after it stops working - The Standard, 24 April 2024\n\nEngineers were drafted in to fix Westminster's famous Big Ben clock after it stopped on Wednesday morning.\n\nAn incorrect number of bongs also sounded at the wrong time when the Elizabeth Tower clock appeared to stop for about an hour at 9am.\n\nBig Ben's iconic bongs rang out at 10:06am instead of on the hour.\n\nOne interesting detail\n\n'The Big Ben clock stopped on Wednesday morning with the hands stuck at 9am and the wrong number of bongs sounded.\n\nThe Elizabeth Tower clock appeared to stop for about an hour, before showing the correct time again at 10:15am. Big Ben's bongs also sounded 11am at 10:06am despite the hands of at least two of the clock faces showing 9am.' Here's footage of Big Ben malfunctioning:\n\n\"We are aware that the clock dials on the Elizabeth Tower were temporarily displaying the incorrect time this morning [Wednesday April 24].\n\n\"Teams worked quickly to rectify the issue and carried out servicing to the mechanism, which has now completed.\n\n\"The clock dials of the Elizabeth Tower are currently functioning as normal and no risks to the integrity of the mechanism have been identified.\"\n\nFollowing the historic refurbishment of the Great Clock, rigorous and regular servicing takes place in line with horological industry standards, to ensure the clock can continue to function correctly.\" The\n\nThe clock was showing the correct time again at 10:15am.\n\nOccasional stoppages are part of the \"bedding in\" process for the clock, as the mechanism wears in.\n\nThe hourly strikes of the bells are expected to resume at midday on Wednesday after the system is reset.\n\nBig Ben was silenced between August 2017 and November 2022 during restoration work to the Elizabeth Tower, estimated to have cost around \u00a380million.\n\nThe clock stopped working twice in one week last July, a year after the completion. The\n\n'Big Ben's timekeeping is strictly regulated by a stack of coins placed on the huge pendulum.\n\nBefore 2009, timekeepers kept 10 old pennies beside the mechanism, using the coins to keep the clock accurate. It now also uses special \u00a35 coins created especially for the 2012 Olympics.\n\nAdding or taking away coins affects the pendulum's centre of mass and the rate at which it swings, Mike McCann, the clock's keeper told Reuters news service at the time.\n\nThe clock has rarely stopped - even after a bomb destroyed the Commons chamber during the Second World War, the clock tower survived and Big Ben continued to strike the hours.'\n\nThe Great Bell, commonly called Big Ben, weighs 13.7 tonnes and strikes every hour, to the note of E natural.\n\nIt is accompanied by four quarter bells that chime every 15 minutes. Notably, back in February this year, amidst a number of royal health scares, footage of one of the white horses caught people's attention for its nervous behaviour during a transfer of the guards:",

As herd animals, the others will follow.'\n\nDr Corridan agreed.

News media reports said the horses belonged to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, a ceremonial unit that parades in royal pageants.\n\nThe ambulance service said later that at least five people had been injured in three locations, from Victoria to Belgrave Square and Fleet Street.

Four soldiers from the Household Cavalry, which patrols the grounds outside Buckingham Palace, were thrown from their saddles.\n\nThe BBC said three military members and a civilian riding a bicycle were hospitalized as a result of the chaos.

They were reportedly spooked by concrete falling off a conveyor belt in Belgravia, a neighborhood whose homes are notorious for being purchased (but not occupied) by Russian oligarchs and other megawealthy foreigners with ties to organized crime.\n\nPer the BBC's incident map, the horses broke loose near Buckingham Palace, and two of them passed through the Strand and were eventually seen as far away as the Limehouse Link tunnel, a distance of some 5 miles or 8 \"kilometres.\" Two animals were captured on \"the Highway,\" the BBC writes (a road which is, in fact, just referred to as \"the Highway\"). TMZ says the horses ran amok for about two hours.\n\nThe BBC's reporting includes several instant-classic quotes in the \"man on the street\" genre, such as the 24-year-old who described the rampaging horses as \"not what you expect to see when you are going to work in the morning,\" and the member of a clean-up crew who said that he and his co-workers \"normally attend other types of traffic accidents\" rather than collisions between cars and horses.\n\nAs unusual as it may have been, the scene has not displaced other news across the websites of leading U.K. tabloids; the Mirror's top current story is, quote, \"YUMMY MUMMY: Ant McPartlin's pregnant wife Anne-Marie cradles baby bump during date with very famous pal.\" This is labeled as an \"EXCLUSIVE\" on the site.

The fields were littered with both construction debris and manure. Even if the fields were in proper condition, they only could accommodate six or seven horses. At the time of the horses' deaths in 2022, the fields were used to accommodate a herd of 64 horses.\n\nMajor General Allan Pepin, the former commander of the Military District of Washington, stated that the conditions which led to the halting of caisson activities, were a result of \"mismanagement,\" not \"soldier abuse.\"\n\nAccording to Maj. Gen. Pepin, \"the conditions reflected a lack of full understanding by Army managers of the horses needs and the training needed for the soldiers to care for them, and also a lack of resources.\"\n\nGeneral Bredenkamp indicated the Army is struggling to purchase new black horses and finding locations large enough for the horses to be kept and trained. They will no longer acquire gray horses, because they are likelier to develop skin cancer.\n\nThe Army is also acquiring lighter-weight caissons and conducting more extensive training for the soldiers to ride and take care of the horses. Each caisson weighs more than 2,500-pounds and these caissons have not been structurally modified since 1918. Reducing the weight of the caisson will put less strain on the horses.\n\nAlso, the Army is now leasing additional pasture land and received funding from Congress to improve the stables.\n\nThe Superintendent of the Arlington Cemetery, Ray Alexander, documented that there are between 27-30 funerals per day, Monday through Friday, and of those, six to eight qualify for escort honors. To satisfy that demand, without surpassing an appropriate workload for the horses, General Bredenkamp said they need six (6) squads of horses.\n\nCurrently, according to Bredenkamp, forty-two (42) horses are being cared for in the program at a professional facility in Virginia. In 2022, there were sixty (60) horses in the program, but many had to be retired.\n\nMy Opinion: \"Mismanagement\" was the word used to describe the situation resulting in two (2) horses being euthanized in February 2022 and causing the halt of the caisson platoon activities.\n\nThe situation was compounded by a series of errors and omissions that should have been identified and corrected, especially by a Program that has been functioning for the past 100 years.\n\nTo begin with, Army veterinarians noted that the hay was so low in quality that it could not be easily digested by older horses. This action forced the horses to attempt to find any edible feed on the ground that was littered with manure and construction debris.\n\nIn August of 2021, the Army veterinarians surfaced this issue to the caisson platoon leadership, but the Army veterinarians made no attempt to voice their concerns above and past the caisson platoon leadership level.\n\nThe platoon leadership had no way to force the hay supplier to provide a higher-quality hay because the Army contract did not specify the nutrition value required in the hay for the horses.\n\nThe individuals that prepared the Army contracts for the hay were not contacted by the Army veterinarians to include specifying the hay's nutritional value required for the horses. In summary, there was no long-range management program for the care of the horses.\n\nThus completes the \"circle of mismanagement\" that resulted in the deaths of two (2) horses and the suspension of the horse-drawn caisson program.\n\nThe irony of the situation was that this ceremonial program was a tradition at Arlington National Cemetery for over 100 years.\n\nNow, hopefully, positive changes will be made in the implementation of the program, according to Major General Bredenkamp. The question I pose is:\n\n\"Why has not a deadline been established for the horse-drawn caisson program to be resumed?\"\n\nWithout an established deadline to be working toward, we may not see the horse-drawn caissons performing their primary ceremonial mission until the next decade!", "source": {"uri": "clermontsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Clermont Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clermont_sun@clermontsun.com", "name": "Clermont Sun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisson_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caisson (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_National_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arlington National Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Military_District_of_Washington", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Military District of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_U.S._Infantry_Regiment_(The_Old_Guard)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Platoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Construction waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 463, "textEnd": 471}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

After the cavalry chaos and injuries on the streets of London this week, she explains why all the working horses must be retired by the army and police:\n\n\"People around the world were rightly shocked by images of blood-soaked horses bolting through the streets of London.\n\nThe animals, used by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, were spooked by nearby building works, bucking off their riders and running amok. Two of the five escaped horses, Vida and Quaker, collided with humans and vehicles during their five-mile ordeal, and in the aftermath, both needed surgery.\n\nThis tragedy isn't the first such incident involving a Household Calvary horse. Just last year, during the king's coronation procession, a horse backed into the crowd, treading on a police officer's foot and knocking down onlookers.\n\nPETA's Vice President of Programmes Elisa Allen\n\nVida, the grey mare currently making headlines on account of her recent ordeal which resulted in her running blood-drenched through the streets, allegedly has a history of reactiveness - she reportedly kicked a soldier in the head during the coronation.\n\nSuch incidents should serve as a stark reminder that horses are not police officers or military equipment but sensitive animals who are easily startled and don't belong on crowded, noisy streets carrying humans, who pull on the reins to control them via their delicate mouths.\n\nFollowing this week's chaos, a Household Cavalry representative admitted that every morning, some 150 horses are forced to perform drills in London's streets and parks in an attempt to desensitise them to noise and crowds and reduce their panic when placed in stressful situations at bustling events. But as most people know, desensitising a horse is no sure task.\n\nAs prey animals, their natural fight or flight instinct is paramount to their survival - and the only reliable outcome is that a horse will behave unpredictably.\n\nAttempting to suppress horses' natural stress response puts them at risk - those used to control rowdy crowds are often the targets of hooligans. Earlier this week, a horse was struck with an umbrella at a St George's Day protest, and in 2020, crowds threw glass bottles and even a bike at mounted officers.\n\nTradition is no excuse for cruelty. Just as the practise of using horses to pull buggies has long since faded from our streets with the advent of cars, so must our ever-evolving knowledge of animal sentience spell the end of horse exploitation by our police and military.\n\nA Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment spokesperson has pledged that when it comes to spooking horses, the British Army will \"strive to minimise the risk of this recurring\", but the only way to ensure that is to retire the animals.\n\nWhile they're at it, the Ministry of Defence should also retire the King's Guard's ghastly bearskin caps.

(AP) -- Wild horses will stay in North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park amid fears from advocates that park officials would remove the beloved animals from the rugged Badlands landscape, a key lawmaker said Thursday.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven said he has secured a commitment from the National Park Service to maintain the park's roughly 200 horses. His office said the Park Service will abandon its proposed removal of the horses under an environmental review process begun in 2022.\n\n\"This will allow for a healthy herd of wild horses to be maintained at the park, managed in a way to support genetic diversity among the herd and preserve the park's natural resources,\" Hoeven's office said in a statement.\n\nPark visitors, much to their delight, often encounter the horses while driving or hiking in the rolling, colorful Badlands where a young, future President Theodore Roosevelt hunted and ranched in the 1880s.\n\nThe horses roam the park's South Unit near the Western tourist town of Medora. In 2022, park officials began the process of crafting a \"livestock plan\" for the horses as well as about nine longhorn cattle in the park's North Unit near Watford City. Park officials have said that process aligned with policies to remove non-native species when they pose a potential risk to resources.\n\n\"The horse herd in the South Unit, particularly at higher herd sizes, has the potential to damage fences used for wildlife management, trample or overgraze vegetation used by native wildlife species, contribute to erosion and soil-related impacts ... and compete for food and water resources,\" according to a Park Service environmental assessment from September 2023.\n\nProposals included removing the horses quickly or gradually or taking no action. Park Superintendent Angie Richman has said the horses, even if they ultimately stay, would still have to be reduced to 35-60 animals under a 1978 environmental assessment. It wasn't immediately clear how Hoeven's announcement affects the future number of horses or the longhorns.\n\nThousands of people made public comments during the Park Service review, the vast majority of them in support of keeping the horses. North Dakota's Republican-controlled Legislature made its support official in a resolution last year. Gov. Doug Burgum offered state help to maintain the horses.\n\nHoeven's announcement comes after Congress passed and President Joe Biden recently signed an appropriations bill with a provision from Hoeven strongly recommending the Park Service maintain the horses. The legislation signaled that funding to remove the horses might be denied.\n\nThe horses descend from those of Native American tribes and area ranches and from domestic stallions introduced to the park in the late 20th century, according to Castle McLaughlin, who researched the horses as a graduate student while working for the Park Service in North Dakota in the 1980s.", "source": {"uri":

The legislation signaled that funding to remove the horses might be denied.\n\nThe horses descend from those of Native American tribes and area ranches and from domestic stallions introduced to the park in the late 20th century, according to Castle McLaughlin, who researched the horses as a graduate student while working for the Park Service in North Dakota in the 1980s.", "source": {"uri": "chatnewstoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHAT News Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Introduced species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental impact assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_City,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watford City, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Watford City, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medora,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medora, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medora, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overgrazing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overgrazing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegetation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Competition_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Competition Facilities", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20240425180440/662aa3b8023d1607a0799758jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Refusing to let go, it tugged on the jacket and pulled her back and forth and up and down before finally releasing it\n\nThe tourist is seen trying to get away from the horse after it clamped down on her jacket - but to no avail\n\nWhat is the King's Guard and what are the rules around them?\n\nThe King's Guard is the name given to the group of soldiers responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace.\n\nTraditionally, guards stand still while on sentry duty, which lasts for two hours, before they then have a four-hour break.\n\nEvery ten minutes, they come to attention, slopes arms and do a march of 15 paces across the area of the post.\n\nThey must work regardless of the weather, and must follow strict rules such as not grinning or laughing, which can result in a \u00a3200 fine.\n\nThe King's Guard are generally not allowed to interact with the public, but may shout if they get too close or present their bayonets if they become aggressive.\n\nThe soldiers must not let anything distract them from their duties - with toilet breaks banned during two hour shifts - and will march through anyone in their way.\n\nWhile tourists can take photos of them, armed officers stationed near them will step in if they get too close or behave disrespectfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile a sign next to the guard warns onlookers that horses may kick or bite, the woman can't resist raising her hand in an attempt to stroke the animal when it tilts its head to nuzzle her.\n\nYet as she does so, the horse bites down on the arm of her black puffer jacket and is soon tugging at it in an increasingly aggressive manner.\n\nKnown as Cavalry Blacks, the horses have been helping to guard the Royal Family and joining ceremonial occasions since 1660, when Charles II was restored to the throne.\n\nHistorically members of the regiment were required to purchase their own horse and this practice for officers continued up until the Second World War.\n\nThe British Army has used horses in a variety of ways, from pulling and carrying supplies and kit, to charging headlong into battle.\n\nHistorically, soldiers who fought on horseback were known as 'cavalry', and were seen as a critical force that helped to dominate the battlefield.\n\nCavalry soldiers riding large, heavy and strong horses were used to smash through enemy formations.\n\nSome cavalry, and later mounted infantry, also gave military chiefs mobile firepower on the battlefield.\n\nSmall, light and fast horses were used to scout, patrol and chase down the enemy.\n\nOther horses were used to swiftly transport orders between commanders and officers.\n\nBy 1793, the animals were being used to cart around artillery as part of the Royal Horse Artillery.\n\nDuring the First World War, the horses were vital in transporting troops and equipment across to the frontlines.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I have seen the smile of many from receiving the unconditional love a horse can provide, the comfort and nurturing that is so often needed but that we sometimes can't see ourselves. The horses can feel it.\n\nI developed Yawardani Jan-ga (which means \"horses helping\" in Yawuru language) equine assisted learning as an experiential approach focusing on non-verbal communication or biofeedback from horses for emotional, cognitive and behavioural support. Yawardani Jan-ga can address individual factors linked to cycles of disadvantage, social exclusion and suicide.\n\nAll children and young people need to develop skills to manage their social relationships, school, work and outside interests. But for Aboriginal youth from complex family environments - often a legacy of intergenerational trauma - violence and distress can become normalised reactions.\n\nUsing a range of culturally secure approaches, we have been able to determine the extent to which equine assisted learning can address outcomes. Horses are naturally capable of offering what is required.\n\nTheir medicine is not always obvious at first, and part of the work we do is to provide such opportunities for our young people to tune into these experiences. Sessions normally last about an hour. We offer a variety of activities as we take our young people on a journey with the guidance and feedback from the horses. The themes we explore vary from the early work around calmness and regulation to boundaries, self-thought, feelings as natural and facing life's challenges. Each session is led by the young person around what they would feel is right for them and we are guided by the horses' responses to those experiences.\n\nA young person may choose to do some leading with the horse around the obstacle course. Utilising only observational language, the practitioner relates the experiences back and forward between the horse's responses and the young person's responses. We capture this session through clinical notes, photography and video. At the end of each session, we ask one integration question to summarise the main feelings from that particular session. This is not scripted in a way where young people need to fill in forms or tick boxes. It is recorded verbatim.\n\nWe have many stories of this work over the four years of Yawardani Jan-ga and with more than 2,000 young Aboriginal people. I have witnessed many phenomenal things. I have seen horses lie down in an offer of absolute support and mirroring to little people who are tired and have no light inside them for that day.\n\nPerhaps we are looking at mental health without the holistic lens that it requires. We know full well that you can tell a person that they are important, they are valuable, they are loved, for example; but if they do not feel it - if it is not truly what they think themselves - then it is often short-lived and does not become who they are for long.\n\nOne of the best parts about working with horses for me is their honesty. They reflect us, and sometimes you do not like what you see of yourself. While it can be hard, rejection for example is a part of life and finding ways to feel acceptance is one of the struggles of adolescence. The trigger for belonging can lead to risk taking behaviours. Imagine if horses could take some of that strain, that load - those little pieces that we know are integral but often are missed.\n\nThis work has come at a great cost. It is hard - personally and professionally. It is a heavy backpack to carry. I have amazing family, friends, colleagues and staff who have blessed us with their time and energy over many years, and of course the horses. I was so impatient to just do the work, but I was constantly being hampered as funding cycles have us like mice on wheels. But every day I get up and see the young people and horses together and this hardness fades. We have been able to get going, establish the program, employ our amazing staff and make a real difference in young people's lives.\n\nI hear comments of pure joy each day:\n\nImagine feeling seen, wanted, valued and loved all at the same time. Horses absolutely are medicine - it's a big dose of whatever you need from the inside out.\n\nA lot of work is being done around suicide prevention. What a sad state of life that we have to coax young people into staying here, and that it is even a choice, this death over life. I'm feeling deep sadness through my own family loss, for anyone, for our little people who have not yet experienced much life. The story they are born into has only just began, and yet they do not wish to stay. We must do more; things are not improving enough. We are getting better and rallying around when a suicide has occurred, but we need to do much more around prevention. Society needs Yawardani Jan-ga everywhere it is needed. Everyone should be able to experience such unconditional support and love.\n\nWhen I think about what our purpose is in life, I feel that mine has been to share horses. It took me many years to know this, but the horses were always there, showing me. I couldn't see it earlier, but later in life when I needed it most, I felt it. It is what I will make of my story for others and myself.\n\nThis work is the biggest privilege I have experienced besides bringing life into the world.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgenerational trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aboriginal Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonverbal communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social relation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biofeedback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwarfism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f3595c8ae7aee2b9e3a350778dc2c23624e6b7/66_151_1296_778/master/1296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=0989d04cd53c88e4d53666af972fdca2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

However, they might appear more frustrated than usual when listening to jazz music.\n\nEleven years ago British researchers found that horses in stalls seemed calmer when listening to country or classical music compared to jazz or rock. Today it seems there's perhaps an even better sound for stalled horses: the sounds of nature.\n\n\"Sound enrichment may decrease the expression of frustration behavior overall, and nature sounds may be the optimal form of sound enrichment to promote naturalistic behaviors, such as foraging,\" said Chloe Bolanos, BSc, an animal behavior intern in the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis. Bolanos, who works under the leadership of Amy McLean, PhD, presented at the 2024 19th Conference of the International Society for Equitation Science (ISES), held March 14-16 in Cambridge, New Zealand.\n\nStalled horses often show signs of frustration, such as pawing or kicking, and some even express stereotypies -- repetitive behaviors that don't seem to have a purpose -- such as crib-biting, windsucking, or stall weaving, Bolanos said. Enriching the stall environment with objects such as mirrors, fixed brushes, and toys can help reduce frustration, she said, but so might various sounds.\n\nBolanos and her fellow researchers tested the responses of six Warmblood horses to different kinds of prerecorded sounds: jazz, country, nature sounds, lullabies, and classical music. None of the recordings included singing or other vocals, and the team played the recordings and observed the horses for one hour twice a day for two weeks. They measured the horses' time spent foraging, interacting with horses in nearby stalls, and showing frustration or other abnormal behaviors.\n\nOn the first and last days of the study, the horses had no sound enrichments, to create what scientists call a washout period to help serve as a control, McLean said. On the other days, horses heard one of the five sound types chosen randomly for that observation period.\n\nOn average the horses showed frustration behaviors more than twice as often when listening to jazz compared to the first day of the study when they heard no recordings, said Bolanos. The other recordings were associated with essentially the same amount of frustration behavior as that exhibited the first day.\n\nDuring the jazz sessions the horses kicked more and were more aggressive with their neighbors, McLean added. Plus, the horses that cribbed did so more when jazz was playing. Even so, it's possible the horses were reacting to that specific jazz playlist, she explained.\n\nBy contrast, when listening to nature sounds, the horses spent about 15% more time foraging than they did on Day 1, she said. Foraging time was about the same as Day 1 for all other sound treatments.\n\nIn general the horses showed far less frustration on the last day of the study -- when no sound recordings were playing -- than the first day of the study -- which also involved no recordings. This suggests that two weeks of sound enrichment might be beneficial for the welfare of stalled horses, regardless of the sounds played.\n\n\"Horses that are stabled spend most of their day standing with little to no enrichment,\" McLean said. \"This may lead to the expression of frustration behaviors and other abnormal behaviors (that) can be used as indicators of past or present welfare issues.\n\n\"Frustration behavior expression was significantly decreased from pre-enrichment to post-enrichment, thus displaying that sound enrichment may be a tool to improve the behavioral welfare of stabled horses,\" she added.\n\nFurther research on more genres of music and playlists within genres could lead to a better understanding of the effects of sounds on stabled horses and practical recommendations for horse owners, McLean added. \"We are hoping at some point to test in (equine) hospital settings as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Horse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christa_leste_lasserre@thehorse.com", "name": "Christa Lest\u00e9-Lasserre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Bolanos_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Bolanos (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foraging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warmblood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warmblood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotypy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lullaby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lullaby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weaving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://thehorse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HorsesStalledInBarn-iStock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-14", "dateEnd": "2024-03-16", "textStart": 988, "textEnd": 999}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The Independent takes a look below.\n\nFormed in 1992, The Household Cavalry is made up of the two most senior regiments in the British Army: The Life Guards and The Blues & Royals.\n\nIt is divided into the Household Cavalry Regiment and the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, according to its website.\n\nThe Household Cavalry Regiment, based at Combermere Barracks in Windsor, is the corps's operational wing of four squadrons - and fights as part of the Royal Armoured Corps.\n\nThe regiment had squadrons on duty with the United Nations in Bosnia in 1994-95 and with Nato forces in Kosovo in 1999. It also fought in Afghanistan in 2006.\n\nThe Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment is the ceremonial face of the regiment, conducting mounted state and public duties in London.\n\nIt carries out the ceremonial duties from Hyde Park Barracks in London. It consists of one squadron from The Life Guards, one from The Blues and Royals and one joint Headquarters Squadron.\n\nMembers of the regiment take part in many of the great state occasions such as Trooping the Colour and the State Opening of Parliament. They also stand sentry at Horse Guards, once the official entrance to St James's Palace and Whitehall Palace.\n\nThe horses of the Household Cavalry often have a prominent role in royal ceremonies in the UK. The horses are chosen for their height (at least 168cm) and strength as they need to be able to carry a soldier plus kit for a long period of time, according to forces.net.\n\nThe horses are trained for several months and ridden on the streets of London to get used to heavy traffic and loud noises, including gun salutes and military bands. Each horse is usually assigned to one specific soldier.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As the sun's first glow bathes the lawns of Hyde Park and sparkles on the Serpentine, around 200 horses and soldiers depart their barracks in central London and split up into small groups. These troops start in walk, stretching the legs of their horses, before building up into trot for an hour's hack through the capital. This ritual takes place six days a week, more than 300 days every year. And this has been the case for at least 300 years.\n\nIn the Household Cavalry it's called the Regimental Watering Order, and for Londoners, if you haven't actually witnessed the act itself, you've probably passed echoes of its centuries-long practice in your daily life.\n\nWhen Charles II first formed his mounted bodyguard - the Life Guards, and later the Royal Horse Guards (Blues) - barracks and organised stabling simply didn't exist. Instead, troops would be spread across the city, billeted in inns, where they would utilise the equine infrastructure of a city which numbered its equine inhabitants by the hundreds of thousands.\n\nBut 18 and 19 century London was still a city where almost all drew their water from wells, public fountains and rain butts. If you ride or own horses, you'll know well the importance of keeping a horse hydrated. An average-sized cavalry horse (or Cavalry Black) needs to drink upwards of 60 litres a day - that's more than 100 pints for comparison. This is a tricky logistical proposition in a world of limited running water.\n\nIn the past, the answer was found in the Watering Order. Each Troop would rise, muck out, groom, tack up and then ride out from their billet to a place where water could be found in abundance. This could be a brook or a lake on a common, or a stream in the outskirts of the city. In later centuries, as the city sprawled, it might be found at one of the many stone troughs provided by London boroughs. There's a great example of one of these troughs on Wimbledon Common.\n\nBut Watering Order served more than one purpose. By trotting to heathland or common as a troop, the soldiers could exercise their horses, keeping them in good condition. And the troopers themselves could conduct low-level riding drills and fitness training.\n\nIndeed, these are the same reasons the Household Cavalry still trot through the streets of London today. An hour of active trot a day is essential for the health, welfare and condition of the herd. The results speak for themselves when we see the Regiment on parade trotting down the Mall in full state kit.\n\nBut London of the 21 century is very different to the London our predecessors navigated. While our horses now benefit from an unlimited supply of running water in the stalls of their cutting edge, multi-story \"horsepark\", their morning exercise can be fraught with all manner of modern obstacles. Today horses must become inoculated to the hustle and bustle of revolving bus stop ads, jink round oblivious headphone-wearing pedestrians, or, as we saw this week, stay calm in the soundscape of a modern construction project.\n\nThe incident this week, where four military service personnel were thrown from their horses, which then ran, crashing into several vehicles across the streets London, is perishingly rare given three centuries of Watering Orders and it's a certainty that the welfare of all involved will be the priority now - including the horses.\n\nDespite Household Cavalry soldiers being trained for front line combat first and foremost, their equine training is unparalleled. Held at a state of readiness, a team of cavalry farriers work with the Regimental Vet and act as equine paramedics if an incident of this type occurs. I once witnessed one rip his own shirt off to staunch a cut on a horse's leg, so I have no doubt that the horses are getting the very best attention.\n\nLondon was once a city that moved to the sound of hoof beats. Today there are only a few echoes of this past left to us. The Household Cavalry Museum is one of the places you can hear and see this.\n\nNestled in Horse Guards building on Whitehall, it's the only publicly accessible part of this iconic landmark where the First Duke of Wellington once sat. Every day, visitors can look into the working stables of the resident King's Life Guard and witness the professionalism, excellence and genuine care Household Cavalry soldiers provide to their steeds.\n\nThe Household Cavalry museum tells the story of over 350 years of service to the Sovereign, and includes a view into the working stables of the modern Regiment.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barracks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Horse_Guards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Horse Guards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Guards_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life Guards (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles II of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_carriage", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hackney carriage"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Common", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Common"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_tack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse tack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London boroughs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Guards_(building)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse Guards (building)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land Forces", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Training", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEI_201210327_9c34d1.jpg?crop=49px%2C181px%2C2285px%2C1294px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Most notably amongst them was the immensely strong yet calm Irish Draught breed.\n\nUndoubtedly questions will be asked of the Household Cavalry how this occurred, and of the necessary risk assessments put in place to mitigate against any harm to the animals and to the public when carrying out training. But what must be avoided is for this isolated and rare incident to degenerate into a debate on ending the practice of working animals in the Armed Forces.\n\nIndeed, within moments of the story breaking, social media was awash with the usual voices condemning the \"barbaric\" practice of working animals, and how it was supposedly even a \"throwback to Empire that is now clearly outdated\".\n\nIn fact nothing further could be true. Whilst those habitual cultural apologists on the Left would love nothing more than to see further erosion of the tradition and grandeur with which the British military is well known and respected for around the globe, the Household Cavalry's use of working horses still serves important practices at state functions and ceremonies, not to mention the immense tourist boost it brings to the UK tax system.\n\nA union of the esteemed Life Guards and Blues and Royals regiments of the British Army, the Household Cavalry represents the epitome of military tradition and honour, whilst a Household Cavalry horse is not your average horse. Carefully selected and trained, these equine allies embody the strength, grace, and discipline needed to perform these types of duties.\n\nJust as professional athletes are chosen to represent their country, such is the same for these noble steeds. Not just chosen for their physical attributes, these horses need to have an even temperament and trainability to perform such a monumental (and privileged) task.\n\nAs such they undergo rigorous training drills with experienced grooms and handlers, ensuring their physical performance is up to speed, and that their nutrition and veterinarian needs are met to the highest standards - resulting in healthy and happy horses. Far from calls for concerns over their animal rights, these are some of the best kept, maintained, and healthy horses in existence.\n\nIn an ever-growing war on culture, tradition, and heritage, we must resist the inevitable calls to end the four centuries old practice of working horses in the British Army.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Working animal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Draught", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Draught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limehouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Guards_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life Guards (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_and_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blues and Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Iq3qTvZaGI3iDuMXBB38GA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/79895fda0afce42450e4e8d6d73d8558", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507834", "eventUri": "eng-9507834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Carriages frequently crashed at Hyde Park Corner.\n\nOf course if a horse gets loose in London these days and is panicked, there are a lot more obstacles and traffic, particularly moving vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians, for it to crash into than there were in the old days.\n\nThey will not intentionally gallop into something, inanimate or human, but if they are bolting they may be more focused on what is behind them than what is in front of them.\n\nOn top of that, a 700kg horse with iron shoes on well-worn tarmac, when you throw speed of even only 20 mph into the equation, is not conducive to either braking or steering. It can be like an elephant on ice skates.\n\nAs a jockey exercising horses at a racing stable in the morning, it was amazing how often one horse spooking at something - for example a pigeon flapping out of a hedge or even a noise, which is being put forward as the catalyst for Wednesday's mass unseating - would cause a chain reaction behind it in the string.\n\nHowever, fresh racehorses primed to run fast are very different from the normally placid ceremonial horses of the Blues and Royals, which are accustomed to traffic, crowds and noises; exercise in London every day; and doubtless took part in the Queen's funeral and the Coronation last year. But it may account for why five became loose on Wednesday.\n\nDr Gemma Pearson, the director of behaviour at the Horse Trust based at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Edinburgh, said: \"That is evolutionary. If a zebra sees a lion jump out, it will try to avoid it and the rest of the herd is likely to react in the same way and go in the same direction. That's instinct rather than a horse actually thinking about it.\"\n\nI am not sure how often Army horses break loose in Hyde Park, but nine times out of 10 they will find their way home back home to the barracks - not to Whitechapel.\n\n\"They would normally go out of their way to stay together,\" Dr Pearson added, \"but if they go different sides of a bus you can see how they could get separated.\"\n\nBlood on a grey always looks infinitely worse than it does on a bay or brown horse because it shows up so dramatically, but my advice to anyone thinking of trying to stop a loose horse galloping at speed is don't.\n\nBy all means catch one when it has come to a stop, but I once saw a Swiss trainer's wife trying to stop her husband's runner in the 1,000 Guineas before the race as it galloped loose round the track.\n\nAt the last second, she stepped out of its way, but the horse was thinking similarly and also took evasive action - in the same direction.

Over recent years the growth of Ulster University, the development of the Linen, Titanic and Cathedral Quarters and the expanse of Belfast Harbour have fundamentally changed the requirements of the power system that services the city. In response, SONI is working to transform the system to meet these requirements through our Energising Belfast project.\n\nSONI, the electricity system operator for Northern Ireland, manages the transmission system, or the 'Grid' as it is better known, to bring electricity to every part of Northern Ireland. From our control centre, we manage the electricity grid to ensure that power can flow safely, securely, and reliably from where it is generated to where it is needed.\n\nBeyond managing the Grid in real time, our expert engineers are responsible for planning ahead to ensure our energy infrastructure meets the needs of the future. Energising Belfast is part of planning for the future; crucially, the project will ensure that Belfast City Centre, its people, and its businesses have the clean energy needed to grow in the years ahead.\n\nRead more: Amazon introduce first electric cargo bikes in Northern Ireland\n\nRead more: Belfast City Council makes history by endorsing Plant Based Treaty\n\nAs countries across the world move rapidly toward decarbonisation in the fight against climate change, Northern Ireland must continue to do the same. New climate change laws set by the Northern Ireland Assembly require NI to have at least 80% renewable energy generation 2030.\n\nEnergising Belfast will not only help NI to reach our climate targets through supporting the city's transition toward the electrification of heat and transport, but it will also support the aspirations of Belfast City Council's 'Belfast Agenda' by increasing the employment and residential population in the city and help to drive economic development in alignment with the Belfast Region City Deal. A thriving city centre is vital to the prosperity of the entire city and region and SONI are pleased to say that this project will deliver a grid ready to help power Northern Ireland's energy transition.\n\nThe project will involve a new high-capacity underground cable connecting Donegall Main substation (near Broadway roundabout) to substations at Belfast North Main (off Whitla Street) and Belfast Central Main (off Little Patrick Street), as well as the construction of two new substations at new sites nearby to help increase the system's capacity.\n\nAs with all our projects, SONI are committed to keeping communities at the heart of grid development, which is why in the time ahead, our team will continue to engage with the local community, businesses, and elected representatives as we understand that no one knows an area better than those who live and work in it and represent it.\n\nSONI looks forward to delivering this project in collaboration with the local community and our partners NIE Networks. We are determined to develop a power system that meets the growing needs of our city centre today and helps deliver a cleaner energy future for generations to come.\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulster University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_Harbour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belfast Harbour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Centre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belfast City Centre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast City Centre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Council", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast City Council"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_Central_(Northern_Ireland_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast Central (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roundabout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/news/news-opinion/article29124677.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SONI-Belfast-Eco-3x3-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550128", "eventUri": "eng-9550128", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

There's a lovely feeling of achieving something beautiful together, and a growing excitement that, later this summer, we'll be able to row down the Lagan and out to the open sea!\"\n\nVisiting the construction work, Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor Ryan Murphy, said Water Works was a great example of how the Belfast 2024 programme was encouraging more people to discover the benefits of creativity.\n\n\"PS2and the boat building crews are creating something really special here, bringing back older skills to inspire us to make better use of our waterfront location and consider the role of rivers and waterways to Belfast's development,\" he said. \"They're also building new friendships, improving their mental health and showing the value that arts and culture can bring to our lives - key goals of why we have invested in our Belfast 2024 programme. I look forward to seeing the boat in action on the Lagan later this summer and encourage anyone who wants to get involved to call into the group's new drop-in space in CastleCourt and come try their hand at mini boat building, making sails and lots of other free activities.\"\n\nDr Paul Mullan, Northern Ireland Director from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: \"We are pleased to support ten exciting Belfast 2024 'Our Future Heritage' projects which are using \u00a3250,000 of heritage funding made possible by National Lottery players to explore Belfast's heritage.\n\n\"Together, cultural organisations, artists and community groups are providing opportunities for people to engage with the city's built, cultural, industrial, maritime, natural and intangible heritage.

The wind operated against speed all the way, and under the circumstances the flight must be considered a very fine performance.\n\nMr Alex Cobham, pilot manager of the De Haviland Company, has made arrangements whereby, he is sure, the service will be maintained no matter how bad the weather may be.\n\nLast night's departure was witnessed by Sir Robert Meyer, Town Clerk, and Lady Meyer, who stated they would shortly be crossing together.

The Mubi release, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival last fall, sees directing brothers Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross applying their semi-improvised production stylings to five teenage actors: a compelling technique that doesn't manage to fully satisfy its appetite for behavioral observation.\n\nIntroduced through glimpses of their student IDs and childhood bedrooms, Tony Abuerto, Micah Bunch, Nichole Dukes, Nathaly Garcia and Makai Garza (mostly just playing themselves) leave behind those adolescent identities, pile into a van and gun it west toward the Pacific Ocean. As the group cheers accelerating out of their small Oregon town, the film's sound mix grows into the furious turbulence of a space shuttle breaking out of the Earth's atmosphere. This will be a summer to remember.\n\nAlong for the ride are the Rosses, stringing the story from one loose scenario to another and serving as their own camera operators (and editors too, for good measure). Often shaking along just a few steps behind the teens, \"Gasoline Rainbow\" could be mistaken for a found-footage feature at a glance, though there are also plenty of landscape wides to add a travelogue magnificence. Here, the sibling directors fashion a new vehicle for their pseudo-documentary stylings, which last carried them to a Sundance breakout in 2020 with the poignant oddity \"Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets,\" about an eclectic guild of barflies facing down existential troubles during their regular dive's final night of operations.\n\nLike the filmmakers' last effort, \"Gasoline Rainbow\" offers ample space for its performers to paint their own modest self-portrait. Unified in their merriness, the multi-ethnic teenage quintet practically melds together into a single organism, self-sustaining in its light razzing and arguments in good fun. Apart from a brief early kiss, they don't even seem to be sexually motivated. And there's seldom a cell phone in sight, unless it's being used as a flashlight or to queue up broad bangers like \"Big Poppa\" and \"Sweet Child O' Mine.\"\n\nIt's a warm, uncomplicated characterization that forecasts a lot of easy riding. \"Gasoline Rainbow\" fully indulges in its leads' carefree attitude. Even as they wander through the desert or covertly hitch a ride on a freight train, their safety never seems in even the slightest jeopardy. The world is their backyard. Despite the film's observational visual approach, a guiding hand can often be felt moving the teens from place to place -- a protectiveness that comes from the heart, but also quickly limits the film to a wispy, mystical register. Most of the places the teens pass through seem transient and few of the friendly strangers they meet -- punk runaways and traveling skateboarders and other wild things -- make an impression.\n\nThat surrender to naivety is also the essential charm of \"Gasoline Rainbow,\" as well as its narrative spine, with the teens' giddy pull toward the party at the End of the World, mythologized in passing by nearly everyone they encounter.

They Didn't Come Back the Same. | Interviews | Roger Ebert", "body": "For filmmaking brothers Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross, every movie is a journey. The directors behind acclaimed hybrid projects like \"Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets\" blur the line between fiction and nonfiction, presenting real situations that have been preplanned, allowing their characters (often played by non-actors) the space to discover authentic moments. The results are often fascinating, but they require the Rosses (now both in their early 40s) to take major risks, operating on faith that the experimentation and improvisation will lead to something revelatory. The brothers find their movies along the way -- to quote Sonic Youth's \"Hoarfrost,\" \"We'll know where when we get there.\"\n\nThat sense of uncovering is even more potent in their latest film. \"Gasoline Rainbow,\" which opens Friday, focuses on a pivotal period in so many young American lives -- the summer after high school, adulthood stretching out in front of you in all its glorious potential and anxious uncertainty. Bill and Turner worked with slightly more structure than they have in the past, hiring casting directors to help them select five first-time performers to star as versions of themselves: Makai, Micah, Nathaly, Nichole and Tony. In \"Gasoline Rainbow,\" the characters light out from their small town in Oregon, all packed in a beat-up van, on their way to the Pacific Ocean approximately 500 miles away. The rest of their lives will be there when they get back -- this road trip is about holding onto adolescence for at least a few more days.\n\nThe directors presented their cast with scenarios each day of the trip, letting the actors take it from there, and what emerges is a beautifully free exploration of how we become the people we end up as. Making lame jokes, savoring the pleasure of having no responsibilities, singing along to songs that come on the radio, the characters are presented as nothing more than themselves, the Rosses refusing to offer any strained, overarching statement about Gen Z. As always, the brothers emphasize looseness and spontaneity. Or, as Bill tells me, they're striving \"to have enough confidence about what you're doing and what your goals are to be like, 'Yes, I feel very comfortable taking this wild left turn.'\"\n\nThose detours prove to be richly rewarding: As \"Gasoline Rainbow\" rolls along, these teens start to open up to each other and to the people they meet in their travels. We hear about broken homes and deep insecurities -- we discover that some of their futures are far from rosy. By the time we reach the ocean, you feel that they've changed -- that something profound has happened to them.\n\nSomething profound happened to the Rosses as well. Over Zoom -- Bill in Texas where they shot their 2015 bordertown saga \"Western,\" and Turner at home in New Orleans -- they discuss that transformation, how much they relate to these journeying teens, and why they insist you have to suffer for your art.", "source": {"uri": "rogerebert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roger Ebert"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_grierson@rogerebert.com", "name": "Tim Grierson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ross_(Australian_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Ross (Australian politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rosses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Rosses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_(rock_band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rainbow (rock band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Improvisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonic Youth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/blog_post/primary_image/interviews/the-ross-brothers-interview/homepage_GASOLINE_RAINBOW__Courtesy_of_MUBI_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550909", "eventUri": "eng-9550909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The speaker wants to know if they're alone in being who they are -- a \"weirdo,\" as they put it. \"I want to be out,\" they continue. \"I want to be myself, I want to be accepted. I want to be loved for who I am.\"\n\nTechnically we've not yet met this person, but that doesn't matter: We know them. The misfit outsider is a familiar character in movies and literature, and often possesses some wisdom that people trapped in the more conventional daily grind can't see. There's a tiny bit of the prophet in every outsider -- and, of course, all prophets are outsiders.\n\n\"Gasoline Rainbow\" is a technically fictional tale of five such misfits who get in a car and go on a journey toward the Pacific Coast. I say \"technically,\" because like much of the Rosses' work, there's not much separation between reality and make-believe. Their previous film, for instance, the 2020 sorta-documentary \"Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets\" sets up a scenario -- the final night at a Vegas dive bar, on the eve of the 2016 presidential election -- and populates it with real drinkers, who have a real rager on camera. But the bar itself wasn't technically closing, it wasn't in Vegas and these people weren't regulars there. What, you might ask yourself, are you watching?\n\nYou are watching people figure out how to live at the end of the world, how to relate to one another and find joy in the middle of loss and uncertainty. Whether or not the scenario is staged, the human heart of it is absolutely real. \"Gasoline Rainbow\" is a little like \"Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets,\" in that the five teenagers at its center, playing versions of themselves, are looking for a \"party at the end of the world\" that they've heard about. But mostly they are there to be with one another, and it's obvious their real personalities are part of the story.\n\nThe five travelers -- Tony Aburto, Micah Bunch, Nichole Dukes, Nathaly Garcia, Makai Garza -- are all friends in Wiley, Ore. (a town which, incidentally, doesn't exist). They're seeking \"one last fun adventure we can all do together\" before they have to return home and get real jobs. These are kids who didn't like school and didn't like home life. In another movie, they'd be delinquents running from the law.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rainbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Articulated vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prophet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eschatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dive bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_(publisher)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wiley (publisher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Book of Micah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/10/multimedia/gasoline1-kmpf/gasoline1-kmpf-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550909", "eventUri": "eng-9550909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

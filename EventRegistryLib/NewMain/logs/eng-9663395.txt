Kennedy Jr. has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first U.S. presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, and a complaint filed with the hamstrung U.S. agency that oversees election policy might be his only hope.\n\nCNN will host the debate on June 27, after incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump agreed in late May to the face-off. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is 12 a.m. EST on Thursday. Wednesday also marks the Juneteenth holiday, which will stall most federal business.\n\nKennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in late May alleging CNN's debate amounts to a large prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company \"illegally\" demanded that Kennedy meet \"different criteria\" to participate in the debate.\n\nThe campaign asked that the FEC take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they have \"come into compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe FEC declined to comment for this article. The agency, hobbled by political division, recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\nThis election cycle presents a nearly unprecedented situation - not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations - first CNN next week, and ABC, which hosts a September debate - been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the top two candidates.\n\nMost recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored them.\n\nCNN said candidates eligible to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nSoon after the debate was announced, Kennedy and his campaign cried foul. Kennedy claimed that Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\n\nOn Saturday, CNN said it is \"not impossible\" Kennedy could qualify, but that he has not yet met the criteria. He has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral college votes, CNN said.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign declined to comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain ballot access across the U.S., with $15 million raised for the process.\n\nIn a news release on Tuesday, the campaign said Kennedy is on the ballot in nine states - totaling 144 electoral votes - and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 other states - for another 166 electoral votes.\n\nBiden and Trump, as the presumptive nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson told Reuters. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said CNN's criteria is \"nonsensical\" because it allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees versus candidates. Biden and Trump will officially be named candidates at their parties' conventions later this summer, after the debate.\n\nHaving an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate, he said.\n\n\"If you're saying that we're looking for those candidates that have serious support to weigh major issues, and dealing with two of the least popular major presidential candidates of all time, then the debate could definitely benefit from having a third party on the stage. It's all dependent on your point of view.\"\n\nSome 41% of registered voters in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39% picked Biden.\n\nTen percent of respondents would pick Kennedy, if he were on the ballot with Trump and Biden, the poll showed.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. fails to qualify for CNN's debate", "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Kennedy called his exclusion from the debate \"undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nTrump campaign sees RFK Jr. as a political problem\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nKennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. qualifies for presidential ballot in Utah, the first state to grant him access\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nPoll: Trump leads big among Utah voters; Biden, Kennedy tied\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.\n\nAfter winning a coin toss, Biden's campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers' screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN.

Kennedy Jr. to qualify for 2024's first U.S. presidential debate, with the independent candidate counting on a longshot bid with a U.S. elections agency to put him on the stage. CNN, host of the June 27 debate, says only President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump have met its conditions for taking part: appear on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and also receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nKennedy has received at least 15% in only three accepted polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making it impossible for him to win the presidency, said CNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery. Kennedy's campaign says he is on the ballot in nine states and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 others, making it possible for him to win the election.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer who has spread misinformation on vaccines, is drawing supporters from both sides of the political divide. It is not yet clear whether he would pull more votes away from Biden or from Trump. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is 12 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) on Thursday.\n\nKennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging CNN's debate is unfair and amounts to a prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump. Kennedy has said Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign asked that the FEC take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the June 27 debate unless they make changes. The FEC declined to comment. The agency recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson said. \"In addition, RFK Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\" This election year presents a nearly unprecedented situation. Not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the candidates. ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, is set to host a September debate.\n\nMost recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored debates. Biden and Trump, as the expected nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said having an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate. \"If you're saying that we're looking for those candidates that have serious support to weigh major issues, and dealing with two of the least popular major presidential candidates of all time, then the debate could definitely benefit from having a third party on the stage. It's all dependent on your point of view,\" Muller said.\n\nSome 41% of registered voters in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39% picked Biden.

Kennedy Jr has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first U.S. presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, and a complaint filed with the hamstrung U.S. agency that oversees election policy might be his only hope.\n\nCNN will host the debate on June 27, after incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump agreed in late May to the face-off. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is 12 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) on Thursday. Wednesday also marks the Juneteenth holiday, which will stall most federal business.\n\nKennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in late May alleging CNN's debate amounts to a large prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company \"illegally\" demanded that Kennedy meet \"different criteria\" to participate in the debate.\n\nThe campaign asked that the FEC take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they have \"come into compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe FEC declined to comment for this article. The agency, hobbled by political division, recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\nThis election cycle presents a nearly unprecedented situation - not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations - first CNN next week, and ABC, which hosts a September debate - been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the top two candidates.\n\nMost recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored them.\n\nCNN said candidates eligible to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nSoon after the debate was announced, Kennedy and his campaign cried foul. Kennedy claimed that Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nOn Saturday, CNN said it is \"not impossible\" Kennedy could qualify, but that he has not yet met the criteria. He has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral college votes, CNN said.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign declined to comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain ballot access across the U.S., with $15 million raised for the process.\n\nIn a news release on Tuesday, the campaign said Kennedy is on the ballot in nine states - totaling 144 electoral votes - and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 other states - for another 166 electoral votes.\n\nBiden and Trump, as the presumptive nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson told Reuters. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said CNN's criteria is \"nonsensical\" because it allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees versus candidates.

Kennedy has failed to qualify for the presidential debate with President Biden and former President Donald Trump. The debate will be hosted by CNN next week in Atlanta, on June 27. Kennedy had until 12:00:01 a.m. ET Thursday to fulfill the debate requirements.\n\nUnder CNN's criteria, a candidate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to be eligible to win 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win the presidency. Kennedy is on the ballot in five states -- Utah, Michigan, Delaware, Oklahoma and Tennessee -- for a total of 42 electoral votes. He'll also be on the ballot in California as the nominee of the American Independent Party, and in Hawaii, on his We the People ticket, which adds up to 100 potential electoral votes.\n\nThough Kennedy has submitted petitions for ballot access in a number of states, several of his applications are still being reviewed by the state election offices.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four major national polls by June 20. According to CNN, Kennedy fell short, with three qualifying national polls.\n\n\"Presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally agreed to their demand,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \"My exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nIn May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing CNN, Mr. Biden, Trump and their campaigns of violating federal election law.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign claims CNN approached the debate criteria differently for Kennedy than for Trump and Mr. Biden, the presumptive nominees of their respective parties. The debate will take place before either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party hold their conventions to formalize their nominees. The Kennedy campaign is alleging the debate is an illegal campaign contribution to both Mr. Biden and Trump\n\n\"By demanding our campaign meet different criteria to participate in the debate than Presidents Biden and Trump, CNN's debate violates FEC law and is a large prohibited corporate contribution to both the Biden and Trump campaigns,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy says that he cannot file a lawsuit against CNN over the debate until the FEC complaint is resolved. His campaign says that the FEC stated there might be merit in his complaint and won't dismiss it, but it has not yet reached a decision.

Kennedy has failed to qualify for the presidential debate with President Biden and former President Donald Trump. CNN will host the debate in Atlanta on June 27.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.\n\nAfter winning a coin toss, Biden's campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers' screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN. Trump's campaign then opted to deliver his closing statement after Biden.\n\nBoth campaigns have agreed to appear at podiums, and microphones will be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_media@newson6.com", "name": "Griffin Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. to qualify for 2024's first U.S. presidential debate, with the independent candidate counting on a longshot bid with a U.S. elections agency to put him on the stage.\n\nCNN, host of the June 27 debate, says only President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump have met its conditions for taking part: appear on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and also receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nKennedy has received at least 15% in only three accepted polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making it impossible for him to win the presidency, said CNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nKennedy's campaign says he is on the ballot in nine states and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 others, making it possible for him to win the election.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer who has spread misinformation on vaccines, is drawing supporters from both sides of the political divide. It is not yet clear whether he would pull more votes away from Biden or from Trump.\n\nThe deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is 12 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) on Thursday.\n\nKennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging CNN's debate is unfair and amounts to a prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump.\n\nKennedy has said Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign asked that the FEC take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the June 27 debate unless they make changes.\n\nThe FEC declined to comment. The agency recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson said. \"In addition, RFK Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nThis election year presents a nearly unprecedented situation. Not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the candidates. ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, is set to host a September debate.\n\nMost recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored debates.\n\nBiden and Trump, as the expected nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said having an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate.\n\n\"If you're saying that we're looking for those candidates that have serious support to weigh major issues, and dealing with two of the least popular major presidential candidates of all time, then the debate could definitely benefit from having a third party on the stage. It's all dependent on your point of view,\" Muller said.\n\nSome 41% of registered voters in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39% picked Biden.\n\nTen percent of respondents would pick Kennedy were he on the ballot with Trump and Biden, the poll showed.\n\n(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Heather Timmons, Alistair Bell and Lisa Shumaker)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The FEC has yet to rule on the complaint.\n\n\"The Federal Election Commission has made clear that the phrase 'presumptive nominee' is not in the FEC's debate regulation,\" Kennedy campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear said in a statement.\n\n\"Failure to use objective criteria renders the debate a campaign contribution, subject to strict donation limits, therefore CNN is violating federal law,\" Spear added.\n\nKennedy has claimed Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nThe next presidential debate, which Kennedy could qualify for and will be hosted by ABC, is scheduled for September.\n\nLast month, Kennedy's campaign announced the independent candidate had qualified for the ballot in California, the state with the most electoral college votes.\n\nIn addition to California, Kennedy is officially on the ballot in Utah, Michigan, Delaware, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii and Tennessee.\n\nHis campaign says he also has collected enough signatures for ballots in New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Idaho, Nebraska, Texas, Mississippi, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Minnesota, Alaska and Washington.\n\nDespite making the ballot in nine states, Kennedy would be currently eligible for far short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win in November.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sheri_walsh@kansas.com", "name": "Sheri Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. speaks during a campaign event, Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2023, in Columbia, S.C. Kennedy was soliciting signatures in support of getting his name on the ballot for the 2024 general election. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard)COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling. The missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning. In a statement Thursday, Kennedy called his exclusion from the debate \"undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\" Both the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election. According to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency. Biden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations. Kennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29. Candidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes. Last month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard. CNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion. Last month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades. After winning a coin toss, Biden's campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers' screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN. Trump's campaign then opted to deliver his closing statement after Biden. Both campaigns have agreed to appear at podiums, and microphones will be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. ___ Kinnard can be reached at", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.\n\nAfter winning a coin toss, Biden's campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers' screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN. Trump's campaign then opted to deliver his closing statement after Biden.\n\nBoth campaigns have agreed to appear at podiums, and microphones will be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the CNN presidential debate on June 27 by the network's Thursday deadline, according to the outlet, a significant blow to his independent presidential bid that will deny him a coveted national stage alongside President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nQualifying for the CNN debate, one of two presidential debates scheduled before Election Day, would have been a plum prize for the Kennedy campaign. More than 73 million people watched the first debate between Biden and Trump in 2020, and Kennedy would have had the opportunity to confront his opponents in front of an extensive national audience.\n\nNo third-party or independent presidential candidate has been on the national debate stage since 1992, when Texas billionaire Ross Perot's self-funded campaign gained enough momentum to earn him a spot alongside President George Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in three debates in the final weeks before the election.\n\nBut Kennedy failed to meet two criteria. In the face of mounting challenges before the deadline, Kennedy had accused CNN of colluding with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him from the debate, and he filed a complaint to the Federal Election Commission accusing the network of violating campaign finance law.\n\nCNN has denied those accusations. Biden and Trump have a mutual interest in keeping Kennedy off the debate stage, as he is drawing support away from both candidates -- and both campaigns are concerned about the potential for him to swing the election in key battleground states.\n\nRelated Story: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Challenges Donald Trump to Debate at Libertarian ...\n\nTo qualify, Kennedy needed to earn at least 15% support in four approved national polls. By Thursday, however, he had only three such polls -- one from CNN, one from Quinnipiac University and one from Marquette University Law School.\n\nKennedy also needed to be officially on the ballot in enough states that he could win 270 votes in the Electoral College -- the threshold for winning the presidency. As of Thursday, Kennedy had less than a third of that number, according to an analysis by The New York Times. He is officially on the ballot in six states -- California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah -- totaling 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nThe ballot access requirement was significantly more onerous for an independent presidential candidate than the polling requirement.\n\nRelated Story: Biden Scores Endorsements from Kennedy Family, Looking to Shore Up Support ...\n\nKennedy needed just one qualifying poll in the last month before the deadline to meet the polling requirement, though his standing in the polls has stalled in recent weeks.\n\nIn contrast, Kennedy's ballot access operation had filed petitions to get on the ballot in more than a dozen other states -- collecting tens of thousands of signatures from registered voters in the process -- as groups aligned with Biden have targeted the petitions with legal challenges.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign had asserted that many of those state ballot petitions would be approved by the June 20 deadline. But by Thursday, the campaign was still no closer to reaching the 270 vote threshold.

Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly claimed that he appears on enough statewide ballots to qualify for next week's debate between President Biden and Donald Trump and has threatened to sue CNN for not letting him on the stage.\n\nBut a Washington Post survey of state election officials found Kennedy is not on the ballot in several states where he has claimed he is -- and he will not reach the requirement by Thursday's deadline to qualify for the debate. The rules of CNN's debate indicate candidates must appear on enough ballots nationwide to earn the requisite 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, along with earning 15 percent support in four national polls.\n\nElection officials in Utah, Delaware, Oklahoma, Michigan and Tennessee have confirmed Kennedy will be on the ballot. Additionally, CNN has counted California and Hawaii, where Kennedy is the presumptive nominee of minor parties where the states have either not certified him or received paperwork. Those states add up to 100 electoral votes. Kennedy also has not yet met the polling requirement for the debate, though could if a qualifying poll is released before Thursday.\n\nKennedy intended to get on all 50 states' ballots quickly as he sought to gain national attention that would come from sharing a debate stage with the two major-party candidates. Kennedy has pointed to his exclusion as evidence that he has been treated unfairly by the parties and the media.\n\nHis campaign has spent months gathering the signatures that states require for independent candidates -- those not affiliated with a political party -- to appear on the ballot in November. Those signatures are then verified by state election officials before the candidate is certified to appear. Kennedy can also appear on states' ballots if he's nominated by a minor political party that has already petitioned for ballot access. But many election officials told The Post they won't certify those petitions or green-light minor party nominees for several weeks, making it impossible for Kennedy to check off the requirement in time for the debate.\n\nKennedy's campaign has argued that Biden and Trump similarly should not qualify for the stage under CNN's rules because they have not yet officially been selected as the presidential nominee by their respective parties. The Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are in July and August, respectively. But CNN has said that because Trump and Biden are their respective parties' presumptive nominees, and major-party candidates don't have to petition states for ballot access, both satisfy the electoral college criteria for the debate, according to CNN.\n\nGiven the realities of our political system, this is a good outcome. Kennedy has zero shot of winning the election and his presence in the debates and on the ballot would simply take away exposure from the two plausible candidates.\n\nThat said, Kennedy is polling somewhere around 10 percent nationally in surveys that include his name. He's far and away the most serious third-party candidate in almost three decades. (Ross Perot was included in the 1992 debates but failed to meet the threshold in 1996; he nonetheless got 8 million votes, 8.4% of all voters.) Given how unpopular Biden and Trump are, it's quite likely that he could considerably improve his standing were he allowed to go toe-to-toe with them on the debate stage.\n\nFurther, his camp is right to complain that the rules are stacked. He has to be officially approved for the ballot in enough states to win the contest before the states approve candidates for ballot access. It's literally impossible. Meanwhile, even though Biden and Trump are technically not yet their parties' nominees, they're given a pass because everyone knows they will be. And, of course, they don't have to jump through any hoops to qualify for ballot access because the Democratic and Republican nominees automatically qualify.", "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside the Beltway"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_joyner@outsidethebeltway.com", "name": "James Joyner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is 12 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) on Thursday. Wednesday also marks the Juneteenth holiday, which will stall most federal business.\n\nKennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in late May alleging CNN's debate amounts to a large prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company \"illegally\" demanded that Kennedy meet \"different criteria\" to participate in the debate.\n\nThe campaign asked that the FEC take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they have \"come into compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe FEC declined to comment for this article. The agency, hobbled by political division, recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\nThis election cycle presents a nearly unprecedented situation - not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations - first CNN next week, and ABC, which hosts a September debate - been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the top two candidates.\n\nMost recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored them.\n\nCNN said candidates eligible to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nSoon after the debate was announced, Kennedy and his campaign cried foul. Kennedy claimed that Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nOn Saturday, CNN said it is \"not impossible\" Kennedy could qualify, but that he has not yet met the criteria. He has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral college votes, CNN said.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign declined to comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain ballot access across the U.S., with $15 million raised for the process.\n\nIn a news release on Tuesday, the campaign said Kennedy is on the ballot in nine states - totaling 144 electoral votes - and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 other states - for another 166 electoral votes.\n\nBiden and Trump, as the presumptive nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson told Reuters. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said CNN's criteria is \"nonsensical\" because it allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees versus candidates. Biden and Trump will officially be named candidates at their parties' conventions later this summer, after the debate.\n\nHaving an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate, he said.\n\n\"If you're saying that we're looking for those candidates that have serious support to weigh major issues, and dealing with two of the least popular major presidential candidates of all time, then the debate could definitely benefit from having a third party on the stage. It's all dependent on your point of view.\"\n\nSome 41% of registered voters in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39% picked Biden.\n\nTen percent of respondents would pick Kennedy, if he were on the ballot with Trump and Biden, the poll showed.\n\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell\n\nStephanie Kelly\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nA New-York-based correspondent covering the U.S. crude market and member of the energy team since 2018 covering the oil and fuel markets as well as federal policy around renewable fuels.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephanie_kelly@reuters.com", "name": "Stephanie Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. Fails to Qualify for Presidential Debate with Biden and Trump - Headlines from America", "body": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has unfortunately not met the requirements to participate in the upcoming presidential debate with President Biden and former President Trump. The debate, scheduled to be hosted by CNN in Atlanta on June 27, has specific criteria that candidates must meet in order to qualify. One of the requirements is to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to potentially win 270 electoral votes. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in five states, totaling 42 electoral votes. Additionally, he is a nominee in California and Hawaii, adding up to 100 potential electoral votes.\n\nDespite submitting petitions for ballot access in various states, some of Kennedy's applications are still under review by state election offices. In addition to ballot requirements, candidates were also expected to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four major national polls by June 20. Kennedy fell short of this requirement, as indicated by CNN.\n\nKennedy expressed his disappointment in being excluded from the debate stage, accusing Presidents Biden and Trump of influencing CNN's decision. He believes that the debate criteria were unfairly applied to him compared to the major party nominees. In May, his campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN, Biden, Trump, and their campaigns violated federal election laws.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign argues that the debate, taking place before the official party conventions, constitutes an illegal campaign contribution to Biden and Trump. They claim that CNN's criteria for participation were different for Kennedy than for the major party nominees, which they believe violates FEC laws. Kennedy stated that he is unable to file a lawsuit until the FCC complaint is resolved, and the FEC has not yet made a decision on the matter.\n\nAs the debate approaches, both Biden and Trump are preparing for their first debate of the 2024 election season. Kennedy, despite his exclusion, remains determined to continue his campaign for the presidency. The upcoming debate between Biden and Trump will be a significant event leading up to the election, providing voters with insight into the candidates' platforms and visions for the country.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. Will Not Qualify for First Presidential Debate \" American Greatness", "body": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will not be on the debate stage on June 27th, falling short of the qualification criteria and missing out on the chance to debate former President Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nAs the New York Post reports, Kennedy just barely fell short in the polling criteria and came up much shorter with regards to the electoral vote criteria. CNN, the host of the debate, requires a candidate to garner 15% or higher in at least four national polls, and to be registered on the ballot in enough states that the candidate could feasibly win 270 electoral votes, which is the minimum required to become President.\n\nKennedy had achieved 15% in three polls, just one poll shy of the threshold. And although his campaign claims that its \"aggressive ballot access operation has surpassed all its milestones to ensure\" ballot access in all 50 states, election officials in a majority of claimed states could not verify Kennedy's ballot access.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign says that he is \"officially on the ballot in nine states,\" with those nine being California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The campaign then claimed that he has \"collected enough signatures for ballot access in 14 other states,\" with those states being Alaska, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Washington. If all 23 of these states verified Kennedy's ballot access, it would make him eligible for 310 electoral votes.\n\nHowever, according to the Washington Post, the only states with election officials that could confirm Kennedy's ballot access were Delaware, Michigan, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Utah. CNN further confirmed his access in California and Hawaii. These seven states together makes Kennedy eligible for just 100 electoral votes, 170 shy of the minimum.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign issued a defiant statement following the report, asserting that Kennedy had indeed crossed both thresholds.\n\n\"In regards to Washington Post's premise that Mr. Kennedy isn't on enough state ballots to fulfill CNN's requirement to be on the debate stage on June 27, the bottom line is he is eligible for more electoral votes than both Presidents Trump and Biden since they have not yet been nominated by their parties,\" said Kennedy campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear.\n\nThe campaign went on to accuse CNN of \"violating federal law\" by not including Kennedy.\n\n\"[The Federal Election Commission] has made clear that the phrase 'presumptive nominee' is 'not in the FEC's debate regulation,'\" Spear continued. \"Failure to use objective criteria renders the debate a campaign contribution, subject to strict donation limits, therefore CNN is violating federal law.\"\n\nThe June 27th debate in Atlanta, Georgia will be the first of just two scheduled debates between Trump and Biden. The second, to be hosted by ABC News, is scheduled for September 10th, after both candidates have been nominated at their parties' respective conventions.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_lendrum@amgreatness.com", "name": "Eric Lendrum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Insights from the Politics Desk - Internewscast Journal", "body": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team's latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nIn today's edition, national political correspondent Steve Kornacki explores whether Virginia, which has drifted away from the GOP at the presidential level, could be competitive this fall. Plus, campaign embed Katherine Koretski and national political reporter Ben Kamisar lay out why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. likely won't be on next week's debate stage.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nThere are several storylines of national significance in today's Virginia primary. But when it comes to the presidential race this fall, the consensus view has been that the Old Dominion will be suspense-free.\n\nThe saga of Virginia's shift from red redoubt to safely blue state is a familiar one, keyed by the Washington and Richmond suburbs and hastened by the emergence of Donald Trump. It's looked like this:\n\nAnd yet, even as Trump leads the GOP ticket once more, two recent polls from Fox News and Roanoke College found him tied in a head-to-head matchup with President Joe Biden in Virginia. When several third-party candidates were included, Biden pulled ahead by 1 point in Fox's poll and 2 points in Roanoke's.\n\nThis is obviously a limited polling sample, and while the Trump campaign is making noise about attempting to put the state in play, it has yet to demonstrate that it will back that talk up with a full-throated push.\n\nStill, if these early numbers showing a tight race persist, the Electoral College implications would be significant.\n\nCurrently, Trump's clearest path to 270 electoral votes involves clawing back Georgia and Arizona and flipping Nevada -- all states with diverse populations where Trump's polling gains among nonwhite voters stand to boost him. Even if he picks up those three, though, he'd still likely need to win back one of the three Big Ten states Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, states with higher concentrations of white voters. But if Trump won Virginia, he could take back the White House without any of those northern states.\n\nOf course, that's a very big if. The current polls paint a clear enough picture of why the state could be competitive. Biden's job approval sits at 43% in the Fox poll and 35% in the Roanoke survey. And when respondents in the Roanoke poll were asked how they now view Trump's four years as president, 44% rated them \"mostly good,\" compared with just 25% who said the same for Biden's tenure.\n\nThe inroads Trump has made with nonwhite voters in national polling are also seen here. The Fox poll has him at 25% with Black voters, up from the 10% the 2020 Virginia exit poll pegged him at. The state also has a significant population of Latinos and Asian Americans.\n\nBut when the fall comes around, the picture could look different in Virginia. Trump himself remains enormously unpopular (a 55% unfavorable rating in the Fox poll).\n\nAnd there's a higher concentration of college degrees among the state's population of white adults than the national average. Not only has this demographic group become increasingly Democratic in recent times, it has also been intensely anti-Trump, turning out at disproportionately high levels in nonpresidential elections, motivated by any and every chance to express displeasure with the former president.\n\nIt's a trend that could help Biden outperform his polling numbers in a state like Virginia.\n\nWhy RFK Jr. likely won't be joining Biden and Trump on next week's debate stage\n\nBy Katherine Koretski and Ben Kamisar\n\nAs Biden and Trump prepare for their first one-on-one showdown in nearly four years next week, there's one wild card they likely won't have to take into account: a third candidate onstage.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. appears set to fall short of qualifying for the CNN-hosted debate when the deadline passes this week. He hasn't yet hit the polling threshold of 15% in at least four approved national polls, having reached that mark in only three so far.\n\nBut more critically, Kennedy is almost assured to fall short of the network's ballot access criteria because qualifying in enough states to win 270 electoral votes is a herculean task for a nonmajor-party candidate at this early point in the election calendar. And on top of that, Kennedy's campaign hasn't been submitting its ballot access petitions at the pace needed to secure ballot lines ahead of the June 20 deadline -- though it's making clear strides toward qualifying by the next debate in the fall.\n\nThat means Kennedy is almost certain to be watching from the sidelines as Biden and Trump debate next Thursday, depriving the independent of earned media and a chance to elevate his long-shot campaign. Instead, Kennedy appears poised to leverage his omission to argue the election is rigged against political outsiders. His campaign has booked $100,000 in national TV advertising on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy faces an uphill battle in order to gain ballot access in all 50 states ahead of November, but at a campaign event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this weekend, he said he'll be on the ballot across the country \"within four weeks.\"\n\nThe independent candidate has already qualified to appear on the ballot in nine states, representing 139 electoral votes, according to NBC News analysis and interviews with state officials. His campaign says it has also gathered enough signatures to surpass the requirement laid out in CNN's criteria, but in many cases the signatures haven't been officially submitted for verification, a process that can take weeks (if not longer).\n\nIn some states, the windows to file those signatures aren't even open yet. That's why the debate window is closing on Kennedy, pending any last-minute legal action by state bureaucrats.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roanoke College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kornacki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kornacki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dominion_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Dominion University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. fails to qualify for CNN's debate. It'll be a showdown between Biden and Trump - World News", "body": "Photo: The Canadian Press Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during a campaign event.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nKennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

The agency, hobbled by political division, recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\nThis election cycle presents a nearly unprecedented situation - not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations - first CNN next week, and ABC, which hosts a September debate - been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the top two candidates.\n\nMost recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored them.\n\nCNN said candidates eligible to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nSoon after the debate was announced, Kennedy and his campaign cried foul. Kennedy claimed that Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nOn Saturday, CNN said it is \"not impossible\" Kennedy could qualify, but that he has not yet met the criteria. He has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral college votes, CNN said.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign declined to comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain ballot access across the U.S., with $15 million raised for the process.\n\nIn a news release on Tuesday, the campaign said Kennedy is on the ballot in nine states - totaling 144 electoral votes - and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 other states - for another 166 electoral votes.\n\nBiden and Trump, as the presumptive nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson told Reuters. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said CNN's criteria is \"nonsensical\" because it allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees versus candidates. Biden and Trump will officially be named candidates at their parties' conventions later this summer, after the debate.\n\nHaving an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate, he said.\n\n\"If you're saying that we're looking for those candidates that have serious support to weigh major issues, and dealing with two of the least popular major presidential candidates of all time, then the debate could definitely benefit from having a third party on the stage. It's all dependent on your point of view.\"\n\nSome 41% of registered voters in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39% picked Biden.\n\nTen percent of respondents would pick Kennedy, if he were on the ballot with Trump and Biden, the poll showed.\n\n(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Win McNamee / Getty Images file\n\nWelcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team's latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nIn today's edition, national political correspondent Steve Kornacki explores whether Virginia, which has drifted away from the GOP at the presidential level, could be competitive this fall. Plus, campaign embed Katherine Koretski and national political reporter Ben Kamisar lay out why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. likely won't be on next week's debate stage.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nThere are several storylines of national significance in today's Virginia primary. But when it comes to the presidential race this fall, the consensus view has been that the Old Dominion will be suspense-free.\n\nThe saga of Virginia's shift from red redoubt to safely blue state is a familiar one, keyed by the Washington and Richmond suburbs and hastened by the emergence of Donald Trump. It's looked like this:\n\nAnd yet, even as Trump leads the GOP ticket once more, two recent polls from Fox News and Roanoke College found him tied in a head-to-head matchup with President Joe Biden in Virginia. When several third-party candidates were included, Biden pulled ahead by 1 point in Fox's poll and 2 points in Roanoke's.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nThis is obviously a limited polling sample, and while the Trump campaign is making noise about attempting to put the state in play, it has yet to demonstrate that it will back that talk up with a full-throated push.\n\nStill, if these early numbers showing a tight race persist, the Electoral College implications would be significant.\n\nCurrently, Trump's clearest path to 270 electoral votes involves clawing back Georgia and Arizona and flipping Nevada -- all states with diverse populations where Trump's polling gains among nonwhite voters stand to boost him. Even if he picks up those three, though, he'd still likely need to win back one of the three Big Ten states Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, states with higher concentrations of white voters. But if Trump won Virginia, he could take back the White House without any of those northern states.\n\nOf course, that's a very big if. The current polls paint a clear enough picture of why the state could be competitive. Biden's job approval sits at 43% in the Fox poll and 35% in the Roanoke survey. And when respondents in the Roanoke poll were asked how they now view Trump's four years as president, 44% rated them \"mostly good,\" compared with just 25% who said the same for Biden's tenure.\n\nThe inroads Trump has made with nonwhite voters in national polling are also seen here. The Fox poll has him at 25% with Black voters, up from the 10% the 2020 Virginia exit poll pegged him at. The state also has a significant population of Latinos and Asian Americans.\n\nBut when the fall comes around, the picture could look different in Virginia. Trump himself remains enormously unpopular (a 55% unfavorable rating in the Fox poll).\n\nAnd there's a higher concentration of college degrees among the state's population of white adults than the national average. Not only has this demographic group become increasingly Democratic in recent times, it has also been intensely anti-Trump, turning out at disproportionately high levels in nonpresidential elections, motivated by any and every chance to express displeasure with the former president.\n\nIt's a trend that could help Biden outperform his polling numbers in a state like Virginia.\n\nAs Biden and Trump prepare for their first one-on-one showdown in nearly four years next week, there's one wild card they likely won't have to take into account: a third candidate onstage.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. appears set to fall short of qualifying for the CNN-hosted debate when the deadline passes this week. He hasn't yet hit the polling threshold of 15% in at least four approved national polls, having reached that mark in only three so far.\n\nBut more critically, Kennedy is almost assured to fall short of the network's ballot access criteria because qualifying in enough states to win 270 electoral votes is a herculean task for a nonmajor-party candidate at this early point in the election calendar. And on top of that, Kennedy's campaign hasn't been submitting its ballot access petitions at the pace needed to secure ballot lines ahead of the June 20 deadline -- though it's making clear strides toward qualifying by the next debate in the fall.\n\nThat means Kennedy is almost certain to be watching from the sidelines as Biden and Trump debate next Thursday, depriving the independent of earned media and a chance to elevate his long-shot campaign. Instead, Kennedy appears poised to leverage his omission to argue the election is rigged against political outsiders. His campaign has booked $100,000 in national TV advertising on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy faces an uphill battle in order to gain ballot access in all 50 states ahead of November, but at a campaign event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this weekend, he said he'll be on the ballot across the country \"within four weeks.\"\n\nThe independent candidate has already qualified to appear on the ballot in nine states, representing 139 electoral votes, according to NBC News analysis and interviews with state officials. His campaign says it has also gathered enough signatures to surpass the requirement laid out in CNN's criteria, but in many cases the signatures haven't been officially submitted for verification, a process that can take weeks (if not longer).\n\nIn some states, the windows to file those signatures aren't even open yet. That's why the debate window is closing on Kennedy, pending any last-minute legal action by state bureaucrats.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nNew law requires all Louisiana public school classrooms to display Ten Commandments", "source": {"uri": "centralmaine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. is close to reaching the polling threshold for next week's presidential debate, but the Thursday deadline to qualify, plus his difficulty gaining ballot access, virtually guarantees he will not make the stage.\n\nWith days until the June 27 debate, Kennedy has reached the 15% polling threshold in three of four qualifying national surveys, underscoring he could be a spoiler in a presidential rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nYet Kennedy, an independent who draws support from voters in both parties, lacks a fourth survey as well as ballot access in enough states to reach 270 electoral votes, the magic number for winning the presidency.\n\nKennedy claims that CNN, which is hosting the debate in Atlanta, is treating him unfairly, but with hours left to meet the network's rules, he is not expected to appear onstage with the two major party candidates for their first debate of the 2024 cycle.\n\nELECTION 2024: FOLLOW LATEST COVERAGE\n\nWhile Kennedy's campaign is attempting to gain access in all 50 states, the process of collecting enough signatures is an enormous undertaking for third-party candidates given the financial disadvantage and groundwork required. Kennedy's campaign claims it has been approved for ballot access in nine states: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah.\n\nThe campaign also states it has collected enough signatures in 14 others.\n\nIn theory, that would give Kennedy access to 310 electoral votes but includes states that have not certified Kennedy and are not expected to do so in time for the debate.\n\nCNN reported on Saturday it is not likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will qualify. The network says Kennedy is on the ballot in only six states, totaling 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that CNN worked in tandem with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him from the debate.\n\nThe debate criteria were \"designed to result in the selection of certain pre-chosen participants, namely Biden and Trump, in a clear breach of federal campaign finance law,\" the complaint stated.\n\nKennedy also argued that since Biden and Trump are the presumptive but not official nominees of their respective political parties, they do not have access to 270 electoral votes. In a previous statement to the Washington Examiner, CNN pushed back against the collusion allegations.\n\n\"The law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning,\" a CNN spokesperson said. \"As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK, Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Tony Lyons, the co-chairman of the super PAC supporting him, told the Washington Examiner he still expects the FEC to weigh in on the debate.\n\n\"The complaint has been filed with the FEC, and so they have time to actually rule on it and find it to be an illegal campaign contribution,\" Lyons, who leads American Values 2024, said. \"And if they do that, then I think they would be forced to include Bobby Kennedy in the debate. And even if the FEC doesn't rule on it, it's so clearly un-American and anti-democratic for CNN to do this.\"\n\nOther political experts were skeptical of the FEC pressuring CNN to allow Kennedy onstage. \"This is just American politics -- when all else fails, sue,\" Bernard Tamas, author of The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties, said. \"And I can't imagine the FEC actually forcing CNN to change its rules, partially because it's dominated by the Democrats and Republicans, so that's problem No. 1.\"\n\n\"But problem No. 2 is that the argument is a little bit -- I wouldn't say flimsy but, I mean, very technically, he might have a point -- but it doesn't seem like it's strong enough for them to force CNN to change what they're planning,\" Tamas, who also is an associate professor of political science at Valdosta State University, said.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign pointed to an FEC spokesperson's comments to Island News that the term presumptive nominee \"is not in the FEC's debate regulation\" as proof that CNN is not exempted from \"excessive campaign contributions.\"\n\nBut again political experts expressed reservation. \"The Federal Election Commission is not known for taking a vigorous stance on things, and I would expect that there wouldn't be much help for RFK Jr. from the FEC,\" Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, said.\n\nThe Trump campaign maintains the former president would welcome Kennedy on the debate stage. \"President Trump said repeatedly he had no problem debating RFK Jr. and he believes any candidate who qualifies for the ballot should be allowed to make their case to America's voters,\" Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the campaign, said in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"It's Joe Biden and the Democrats who are using financial and legal resources to prevent RFK's access to the ballot because they know RFK Jr. is a radical leftist who pulls more votes from Biden than President Trump,\" Leavitt continued.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee declined a request for comment; the Washington Examiner reached out to the Biden campaign. But the president's team has previously made the opposite case about Kennedy -- that he will pull votes from Trump.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mabinty_quarshie@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mabinty Quarshie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. running as an independent means he has to go through a different process to get on the ballot in each state.Charlie Neibergall / AP file\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears set to fall short of qualifying for CNN's presidential debate when the deadline passes this week, leaving the September ABC News debate as his big chance to join President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump onstage.\n\nKennedy hasn't yet hit CNN's polling threshold of 15% in at least four approved national polls, having gotten only three so far. But more critically, Kennedy is almost assured to fall short of the network's ballot access criteria because securing access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes is a Herculean task for a nonmajor-party candidate at this early point in the election calendar. And on top of that, Kennedy's campaign hasn't been submitting its ballot access petitions at the pace needed to secure ballot lines ahead of the June 20 deadline -- though it's making clear strides toward qualifying by the next debate in the fall.\n\nThat means Kennedy is almost certain to be watching from the sidelines as Biden and Trump debate next Thursday, depriving the independent of earned media and a chance to elevate his long-shot campaign. Instead, Kennedy appears poised to leverage his omission to argue the campaign is rigged against political outsiders. His campaign has booked $100,000 in national TV advertising on the day of the debate.\n\nLast month, Kennedy's campaign filed a Federal Election Commission complaint against CNN and against Biden and Trump's campaigns, alleging the way they set up the June 27 presidential debate was illegal. Stefanie Spear, press secretary for the campaign, said it is \"considering\" further legal action ahead of debate night.\n\nKennedy faces an uphill battle in order to gain ballot access in all 50 states ahead of November, but at a campaign event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this weekend, he said he'll be on the ballot across the country \"within four weeks.\"\n\nThe independent candidate has already qualified to appear on the ballot in nine states, representing 139 electoral votes, according to NBC News analysis and interviews with state officials. His campaign says it has also gathered enough signatures to surpass the requirement laid out in CNN's criteria, but in many cases the signatures haven't been officially submitted for verification, a process that can take weeks (if not longer). In some states, the windows to file those signatures aren't even open yet. That's why the debate window is closing on Kennedy, pending any last-minute legal action by state bureaucrats.\n\nIn Minnesota, for example, a spokesperson for the secretary of state's office confirmed to NBC News that it received a nominating petition for Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan on Friday, June 7. But, the spokesperson added, \"Minnesota law provides the office with ten working days to review and verify the petition. Due to an upcoming state holiday on June 19, we have until June 24 to complete this work.\"\n\nThere are also other challenges in states where he's filed signatures. New York Board of Election officials said they have received 13 objections to Kennedy's petitions, though only six followed up. The process of adjudicating those objections is underway, but in the meantime, the office noted that no candidate is officially on the New York ballot until they are certified by the state Board of Elections Commissioners in late summer.\n\nIn Texas, meanwhile, Kennedy is still awaiting word from the secretary of state's office about verification.\n\nHe also faces a tough reality in battleground states like Arizona, where the filing window for independent candidates to turn in petition signatures for ballot access doesn't start until July 28, the secretary of state's office said. That's more than a month after CNN's debate, let alone the network's deadline.\n\nAnd Kennedy's attempt to gain ballot access in Nevada has been frustrated by revelations that a member of the secretary of state's office incorrectly told the campaign it could file petitions without the name of his running mate. He was subsequently told that the state does require petitions to include a running mate and his petitions were disqualified, leading Kennedy to file a lawsuit against the state.\n\nEmails obtained by NBC News revealed that the campaign resubmitted its petition to gather signatures with Shanahan's name attached last week. This puts the Kennedy campaign up against a short timeline to gather over 10,000 signatures by July 5.\n\nThe next chance for Kennedy to qualify for the debate stage is Sept. 10, when ABC News will host another presidential faceoff. That debate has the same ballot access and polling criteria as CNN's, although it's unclear the polling window will open for ABC News' criteria.\n\nSo, while Kennedy has struggled to get the ballot access he needs by the June deadline, he's in far better shape to do so ahead of September.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both in state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his long-shot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totalling at least 270 votes in the electoral college, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nKennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15 per cent in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15 per cent in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 electoral college votes.\n\nKennedy is the third-oldest of 11 children born to former U.S. attorney general Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, and was 14 years old when his father was assassinated during a presidential campaign in 1968.\n\nKennedy Jr. built a public profile in the 1980s as an environmental activist but gained prominence in more recent years as a vaccine skeptic. With respect to foreign policy, he is campaigning on reduced military spending and is a critic of the Biden administration's significant military aid for Ukraine.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nThe Biden-Trump debate will be the earliest on the record since televised presidential debates began in 1960, as they've been traditionally held in September and October.\n\nCandidates outside the Republican and Democratic parties have struggled in the past to reach the debate stage, with Green Party candidate Ralph Nader going so far as to try and crash a 2000 debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore.\n\nJohn Anderson in 1980 debated Ronald Reagan, though a second debate would feature just Reagan and incumbent Jimmy Carter. In 1992, independent businessman Ross Perot qualified for all three debates alongside George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, but did not make the cut four years later in a subsequent campaign.\n\nFour years ago, Biden and Trump squared off in three fractious debates. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows wrote in a subsequent book that Trump proceeded with the first debate despite contracting COVID-19 just a few days before, while Trump's frequent interruptions in the second affair saw Biden remark, \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\"\n\nCNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash are set to moderate next week's debate.

Plus, campaign embed Katherine Koretski and national political reporter Ben Kamisar lay out why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. likely won't be on next week's debate stage.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nIs Virginia actually in play for Trump?\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nThere are several storylines of national significance in today's Virginia primary. But when it comes to the presidential race this fall, the consensus view has been that the Old Dominion will be suspense-free.\n\nThe saga of Virginia's shift from red redoubt to safely blue state is a familiar one, keyed by the Washington and Richmond suburbs and hastened by the emergence of Donald Trump. It's looked like this:\n\nAnd yet, even as Trump leads the GOP ticket once more, two recent polls from Fox News and Roanoke College found him tied in a head-to-head matchup with President Joe Biden in Virginia. When several third-party candidates were included, Biden pulled ahead by 1 point in Fox's poll and 2 points in Roanoke's.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nThis is obviously a limited polling sample, and while the Trump campaign is making noise about attempting to put the state in play, it has yet to demonstrate that it will back that talk up with a full-throated push.\n\nStill, if these early numbers showing a tight race persist, the Electoral College implications would be significant.\n\nCurrently, Trump's clearest path to 270 electoral votes involves clawing back Georgia and Arizona and flipping Nevada -- all states with diverse populations where Trump's polling gains among nonwhite voters stand to boost him. Even if he picks up those three, though, he'd still likely need to win back one of the three Big Ten states Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, states with higher concentrations of white voters. But if Trump won Virginia, he could take back the White House without any of those northern states.\n\nOf course, that's a very big if. The current polls paint a clear enough picture of why the state could be competitive. Biden's job approval sits at 43% in the Fox poll and 35% in the Roanoke survey. And when respondents in the Roanoke poll were asked how they now view Trump's four years as president, 44% rated them \"mostly good,\" compared with just 25% who said the same for Biden's tenure.\n\nThe inroads Trump has made with nonwhite voters in national polling are also seen here. The Fox poll has him at 25% with Black voters, up from the 10% the 2020 Virginia exit poll pegged him at. The state also has a significant population of Latinos and Asian Americans.\n\nBut when the fall comes around, the picture could look different in Virginia. Trump himself remains enormously unpopular (a 55% unfavorable rating in the Fox poll).\n\nAnd there's a higher concentration of college degrees among the state's population of white adults than the national average. Not only has this demographic group become increasingly Democratic in recent times, it has also been intensely anti-Trump, turning out at disproportionately high levels in nonpresidential elections, motivated by any and every chance to express displeasure with the former president.\n\nIt's a trend that could help Biden outperform his polling numbers in a state like Virginia.\n\nWhy RFK Jr. likely won't be joining Biden and Trump on next week's debate stage\n\nBy Katherine Koretski and Ben Kamisar\n\nAs Biden and Trump prepare for their first one-on-one showdown in nearly four years next week, there's one wild card they likely won't have to take into account: a third candidate onstage.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. appears set to fall short of qualifying for the CNN-hosted debate when the deadline passes this week. He hasn't yet hit the polling threshold of 15% in at least four approved national polls, having reached that mark in only three so far.\n\nBut more critically, Kennedy is almost assured to fall short of the network's ballot access criteria because qualifying in enough states to win 270 electoral votes is a herculean task for a nonmajor-party candidate at this early point in the election calendar. And on top of that, Kennedy's campaign hasn't been submitting its ballot access petitions at the pace needed to secure ballot lines ahead of the June 20 deadline -- though it's making clear strides toward qualifying by the next debate in the fall.\n\nThat means Kennedy is almost certain to be watching from the sidelines as Biden and Trump debate next Thursday, depriving the independent of earned media and a chance to elevate his long-shot campaign. Instead, Kennedy appears poised to leverage his omission to argue the election is rigged against political outsiders. His campaign has booked $100,000 in national TV advertising on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy faces an uphill battle in order to gain ballot access in all 50 states ahead of November, but at a campaign event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this weekend, he said he'll be on the ballot across the country \"within four weeks.\"\n\nThe independent candidate has already qualified to appear on the ballot in nine states, representing 139 electoral votes, according to NBC News analysis and interviews with state officials. His campaign says it has also gathered enough signatures to surpass the requirement laid out in CNN's criteria, but in many cases the signatures haven't been officially submitted for verification, a process that can take weeks (if not longer).\n\nIn some states, the windows to file those signatures aren't even open yet. That's why the debate window is closing on Kennedy, pending any last-minute legal action by state bureaucrats.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the first presidential debate hosted by CNN next week, officially setting up a one-on-one clash between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nCNN published an article Thursday morning that said the network's window for candidates to meet the criteria for the June 27 debate in Atlanta closed just after midnight Eastern Time, \"with Biden and Trump meeting the constitutional, ballot qualification and polling thresholds.\" A CNN spokesperson confirmed that Kennedy did not qualify.\n\nKennedy hadn't hit CNN's polling threshold of 15% in at least four approved national polls, having only reached that mark in three surveys ahead of the deadline. He also fell short of the network's ballot criteria, which required candidates to secure access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes, a significant task for a third-party at this point in the election cycle.\n\nAccording to an NBC News analysis, Kennedy is currently on the ballot in 10 states, but is held up in verification status or application windows in a handful of others.\n\nKennedy's absence from the stage next week will be a blow to his longshot campaign as she seeks to gain ground on the presumptive major party nominees.\n\nLast month, Kennedy's campaign filed a Federal Election Commission complaint against CNN and the Biden and Trump campaigns, alleging the way they set up the June 27 presidential debate was illegal. Stefanie Spear, press secretary for the campaign, said it is \"considering\" further legal action ahead of debate night.\n\nKennedy has already used the prospect of his omission from the stage to argue the election is rigged against political outsiders, with his campaign booking $100,000 in TV ads on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy still has a chance to qualify for the Sept. 10 debate, hosted by ABC News. That debate has the same ballot access and polling criteria as CNN's, although it's unclear when the polling window will open. That will also provide Kennedy with additional time to secure access on more ballots around the country.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr faces a tight deadline to qualify for the first U.S. presidential debate. His campaign contends that CNN's criteria are biased in favor of Biden and Trump. With a complaint filed to the FEC, Kennedy's team hopes to delay the debate until fair criteria are implemented.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first U.S. presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, and a complaint filed with the hamstrung U.S. agency that oversees election policy might be his only hope.\n\nCNN will host the debate on June 27, after incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump agreed in late May to the face-off. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is 12 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) on Thursday. Wednesday also marks the Juneteenth holiday, which will stall most federal business. Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in late May alleging CNN's debate amounts to a large prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company \"illegally\" demanded that Kennedy meet \"different criteria\" to participate in the debate.\n\nThe campaign asked that the FEC take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they have \"come into compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act,\" according to the complaint. The FEC declined to comment for this article. The agency, hobbled by political division, recently struggled to rule on artificial intelligence in the 2024 campaign, and has not ruled on related issues in recent elections, experts say.\n\nThis election cycle presents a nearly unprecedented situation - not since 1960 ushered in the era of televised presidential debates have news organizations - first CNN next week, and ABC, which hosts a September debate - been fully in control of the terms and parameters of two debates between the top two candidates. Most recently, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored them.\n\nCNN said candidates eligible to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls. Soon after the debate was announced, Kennedy and his campaign cried foul. Kennedy claimed that Biden and Trump \"are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nOn Saturday, CNN said it is \"not impossible\" Kennedy could qualify, but that he has not yet met the criteria. He has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral college votes, CNN said. The Kennedy campaign declined to comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain ballot access across the U.S., with $15 million raised for the process.\n\nIn a news release on Tuesday, the campaign said Kennedy is on the ballot in nine states - totaling 144 electoral votes - and has collected enough signatures to be on the ballot in 14 other states - for another 166 electoral votes. Biden and Trump, as the presumptive nominees of the Democratic and Republican political parties, respectively, qualify because most states automatically allow them ballot access without petitioning, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson told Reuters. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\" Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said CNN's criteria is \"nonsensical\" because it allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees versus candidates. Biden and Trump will officially be named candidates at their parties' conventions later this summer, after the debate.\n\nHaving an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate, he said. \"If you're saying that we're looking for those candidates that have serious support to weigh major issues, and dealing with two of the least popular major presidential candidates of all time, then the debate could definitely benefit from having a third party on the stage. It's all dependent on your point of view.\"\n\nSome 41% of registered voters in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39% picked Biden. Ten percent of respondents would pick Kennedy, if he were on the ballot with Trump and Biden, the poll showed.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly claimed that he appears on enough statewide ballots to qualify for next week's debate between President Biden and Donald Trump and has threatened to sue CNN for not letting him on the stage.\n\nBut a Washington Post survey of state election officials found Kennedy is not on the ballot in several states where he has claimed he is -- and he will not reach the requirement by Thursday's deadline to qualify for the debate. The rules of CNN's debate indicate candidates must appear on enough ballots nationwide to earn the requisite 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, along with earning 15% support in four national polls.\n\nElection officials in Utah, Delaware, Oklahoma, Michigan and Tennessee have confirmed Kennedy will be on the ballot. Additionally, CNN has counted California and Hawaii, where Kennedy is the presumptive nominee of minor parties where the states have either not certified him or received paperwork. Those states add up to 100 electoral votes. Kennedy also has not yet met the polling requirement for the debate, though could if a qualifying poll is released before Thursday.\n\nKennedy intended to get on all 50 states' ballots quickly as he sought to gain national attention that would come from sharing a debate stage with the two major-party candidates. Kennedy has pointed to his exclusion as evidence that he has been treated unfairly by the parties and the media.\n\nHis campaign has spent months gathering the signatures that states require for independent candidates -- those not affiliated with a political party -- to appear on the ballot in November. Those signatures are then verified by state election officials before the candidate is certified to appear. Kennedy can also appear on states' ballots if he's nominated by a minor political party that has already petitioned for ballot access. But many election officials told The Post they won't certify those petitions or green-light minor party nominees for several weeks, making it impossible for Kennedy to check off the requirement in time for the debate.\n\nKennedy's campaign has argued that Biden and Trump similarly should not qualify for the stage under CNN's rules because they have not yet officially been selected as the presidential nominee by their respective parties. The Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are in July and August, respectively. But CNN has said that because Trump and Biden are their respective parties' presumptive nominees, and major-party candidates don't have to petition states for ballot access, both satisfy the electoral college criteria for the debate, according to CNN.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state,\" a CNN spokesperson wrote in an email to The Post. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nStatements from Kennedy's campaign and on his website have depicted Kennedy's ballot effort using various descriptors. A tracker on his campaign website lists 23 states where it declares \"petitioning complete,\" but when you select a state, it is then described as \"on the ballot.\"\n\n\"While the dark purple color indicating 'petitioning complete' is accurate, the statement below, 'We're on the ballot' is premature,\" Kathleen McGrath, a New York Board of Elections spokesperson, wrote in an email, adding the board will certify in \"the late summer\" after reviewing objections to the petition.\n\nCampaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear did not respond to questions about the discrepancies in the campaign's claims about Kennedy's ballot access, but she said questioning Kennedy's failure to meet the 270 electoral votes requirement was \"nonsensical.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is he is eligible for more electoral votes than both Presidents Trump and Biden,\" Spear wrote in an email.\n\nThe campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on May 29, alleging that Biden, Trump, their respective campaigns and CNN \"colluded\" to leave Kennedy off the debate stage, but the FEC disputes typically take a while to resolve.\n\nIn news releases, Kennedy's campaign also has claimed ballot access it has not achieved. The campaign first claimed it had \"surpassed eligibility\" in a June 7 news release, listing nine states where Kennedy was \"officially\" on the ballot: Utah, Michigan, California, Delaware, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Texas, South Carolina and Florida. However, officials in Florida, California, Hawaii, Texas and South Carolina told The Post that, while Kennedy has either submitted petitions or been nominated by a minor party with ballot access, their certification process is not yet complete.\n\nIn Florida, Kennedy has been nominated by the Reform Party, a centrist party created by Ross Perot in 1995. But the near-defunct political party had lost its ballot access last year and has yet to complete the paperwork to get reinstated and Kennedy on the ballot, according to Reform Party national chair Nicholas Hensley. Hensley said they expect to meet the September deadline to get Kennedy on the ballot in Florida, which is far past CNN's June 20 debate deadline. The assertion that Kennedy is on the ballot in the state has been left out of future news releases issued by the campaign but remains on the website.\n\n\"I think someone got ahead of the horse,\" Hensley said.\n\nIn South Carolina, election officials said the Alliance Party -- a minor party with ballot access in the state -- nominated Kennedy, but they also received petitions submitted on Kennedy's behalf to run as an independent. Despite verbalizing his acceptance of the Alliance Party's nomination, state election officials said they haven't received written confirmation of his acceptance, meaning Kennedy isn't officially on the ballot, as he claims.\n\n\"We anticipate him being on the ballot, but we can't say for certain,\" said John Michael Catalano, South Carolina State Election Commission spokesperson.\n\nSeeking ballot access as an independent candidate is cumbersome, costing a large sum of money to attain by signature collectors in many states as well as lawyers to adhere to a complex patchwork of election laws that vary state by state. Kennedy has sued election officials in Nevada, New York and Idaho, arguing the rules are unfair or illegal.\n\nIn New York, for instance, where his lawyer said the campaign spent $1.1 million on gathering signatures, Kennedy's campaign faces a slew of challenges from Democratic groups. Those groups allege Kennedy's petition should be disqualified because he gave an address that isn't his home and tens of thousands of the signatures were illegible or didn't belong to New York voters. The Kennedy campaign has not responded to all of the allegations but told media outlets that Kennedy considers the New York home his legitimate address.\n\nThird-party candidates would typically be advantaged by the late summer deadlines for ballot access, allowing them time to continue to organize even after major-party candidates are nominated, said Bernard Tamas, a political-science professor at Valdosta State University in Georgia and author of \"The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.\" Kennedy has said he has strategically delayed some petitions to avoid challenges.\n\n\"His problem is, for the debate, it's so fast that it's not set up for him to get on,\" Tamas said. \"It's just a moment that's not working for him.\"\n\nKennedy has sought out easier paths to getting on the ballot, including seeking the nominations of minor parties that already have ballot access in states or creating his own minor party. However, that has come with its own challenges and confusion.\n\nIn North Carolina, Democratic groups are challenging the maneuver, which has also been deployed by independent Cornel West, arguing the party has no political platform except to provide ballot access and identifying some voters who signed the petition not knowing the party's intent. The board of election officials that determines ballot access has yet to rule on the complaints.\n\nMeanwhile, election officials in Hawaii say they have not received the nomination of Kennedy's We the People party which Kennedy recently formed in an effort to get on more ballots.\n\n\"He may be the presumptive nominee through the We The People party which has qualified to field candidates in the 2024 elections, but we cannot say who will be on the ballot until we've received nominees from a qualified political party,\" Aulii Tenn, spokesperson for the state's office of elections, wrote in an email.\n\nOn Monday, Kennedy's campaign declared yet another state it had achieved ballot access in, Mississippi, where his own party nominated him, according to a news release. But, in the same email, Kennedy's campaign acknowledged the party had not yet submitted the paperwork to the state.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meryl_kornfield@seattletimes.com", "name": "Meryl Kornfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. fails to qualify for CNN's debate. It'll be a showdown between Biden and Trump - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nKennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.\n\nAfter winning a coin toss, Biden's campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers' screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN. Trump's campaign then opted to deliver his closing statement after Biden.\n\nBoth campaigns have agreed to appear at podiums, and microphones will be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kennedy Jr.'s window to qualify for CNN's June 27 general election debate, and the network formally announced that he won't make the stage. That hour on Thursday marked the deadline to meet CNN's qualification requirements, which included being constitutionally eligible to become president, having at least four qualifying national polls with at least 15 percent support that meet CNN's guidelines and having confirmed ballot access in enough states to potentially win a majority in the Electoral College (270 electoral votes). Kennedy ultimately came up short on both polls and ballot access in his bid to get a spot on the debate stage alongside President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut even though Kennedy didn't qualify, his legal challenge to the debate is still ongoing. In late May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the CNN debate violates campaign finance law because the network \"colluded\" with the Biden and Trump campaigns in planning the debate and is using different ballot access rules for the two major-party contenders compared with Kennedy. CNN has said that Kennedy's complaint is unfounded. All in all, it seems unlikely -- although not impossible -- that the FEC will intervene on Kennedy's behalf.\n\nHere then is a look at Kennedy's qualification situation and the legal wrangling that could play into the CNN debate.\n\nOn the polling front, Kennedy's situation was pretty cut and dried: He had three national polls at 15 percent or better that qualify under CNN's rules, which means he needed one more at that level of support. However, Kennedy likely missed his final shot at a fourth poll when Beacon Research/Shaw & Co. Research/Fox News released a national survey on Wednesday evening that found him at 10 percent.\n\nAlthough he's polled at around 9 to 10 percent in 538's national polling average since mid-March, Kennedy's support level from survey to survey has varied enough that getting to 15 percent in four qualifying polls seemed plausible for him when CNN released its debate criteria in May. However, Kennedy has hit that mark in just three of the 14 eligible national surveys of registered or likely voters that included him as an option. Still, a small bit of variation in the result of just one other survey would have allowed him to meet CNN's polling criteria -- after all, he hit 14 percent in two qualifying surveys.\n\nYet even if he had gotten a fourth poll, Kennedy sat well shy of CNN's requirement for ballot access at the end of the qualifying period. Unlike the major-party nominees, independent and third-party contenders aren't all but guaranteed ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, so they must navigate each state's rules for garnering a spot on the ballot -- a process that usually involves gathering a sizable number of petition signatures. Kennedy's campaign claims to have made the ballot in 23 states worth 310 electoral votes, but CNN said last Saturday that it had only confirmed he'd made the ballot in six states worth 89 electoral votes. Earlier this week, ABC News confirmed that Tennessee has also put Kennedy on the ballot, but that still gives Kennedy only 100 potential electoral votes -- far short of the 270 he needs to meet the debate requirement.\n\nTo reach 270 potential electoral votes, Kennedy would have needed, at a minimum, nine of the 16 unconfirmed states his campaign claims access in to confirm that he's made the ballot -- a tall order. Recognized minor parties with ballot access in Florida (30 electoral votes) and South Carolina (9) have announced Kennedy as their presidential nominee, and Kennedy's We The People Party appears on the cusp of having access in North Carolina (16), so he might credibly say he's at 155 electoral votes. But that would still leave him needing confirmation in most of the medium-to-large states on his list -- such as Texas (40), New York (28), Ohio (17), New Jersey (14), Washington (12) and Minnesota (10) -- along with perhaps one or two smaller states.\n\nOngoing litigation over Kennedy's ballot status has potentially delayed confirmations in some states, too. For instance, Nevada's secretary of state said the campaign's petitions in the state were likely invalid under state law because they didn't list Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's vice presidential running mate. While Kennedy's campaign has mounted a lawsuit over the issue, it has also begun efforts to recollect signatures with a new petition form in the meantime.\n\nBut Kennedy is also waging a more direct legal battle over the debate qualification situation: He's filed an FEC complaint alleging that CNN's debate violates campaign finance rules. Based on federal law, the organization staging a debate must determine candidate inclusion based on preestablished objective criteria, and, for a general election debate, a candidate's nomination by a particular party cannot be used as the lone factor. Otherwise, the event could be seen as a contribution to the debate participants, subject to campaign finance limits -- which the cost of a debate would almost certainly run well beyond.\n\nWith this in mind, the Kennedy campaign contends that CNN \"colluded\" with the Biden and Trump campaigns to set the debate criteria and make sure that they were the only two candidates on stage. It also argued that CNN is using different qualification criteria for Biden and Trump by mandating that Kennedy meet the 270-electoral vote ballot status requirement even though the two major-party contenders won't be formally nominated -- and thus secure ballot access as their respective parties' nominees -- until their conventions happen later this summer. In response, a CNN spokesperson said in May that \"the law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement.\"\n\nDerek T. Muller, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School who studies election law, told me that the Kennedy campaign's case for collusion may not be particularly strong. Although CNN clearly engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns as it put together the debate, Muller felt CNN might \"have a good leg to stand on\" because the network adopted qualification criteria similar to what the Commission on Presidential Debates has long used for its debates and planned to use for any it hosted this cycle: a 15 percent polling threshold and minimum ballot access threshold. In theory, CNN could have created criteria that would have been nigh impossible for Kennedy to meet, such as a 30 percent polling threshold, but chose not to. Minor parties and candidates have previously challenged such criteria, only for the courts to consistently uphold the CPD's rules. \"There's pretty robust precedent that at least the things that the CPD has used in the past are acceptable criteria,\" Muller said.\n\nHowever, Muller said the Kennedy campaign may have a stronger case that CNN has failed to consistently apply its qualification rule regarding ballot access. \"Biden and Trump are not the nominees. They're not on the ballot in any state,\" Muller said. \"So CNN has had to massage that criteria and say, 'Well, they're the presumptive nominees, and we expect they will be on the ballot.'\" That this is the earliest general election debate ever is part of the issue: Although the CPD uses similar criteria, its debates have always come after Labor Day, by which time ballot certification has concluded in all or nearly all states, making it more straightforward to assess ballot access as a criterion.\n\nYet even if Kennedy's complaint has merit, the FEC may not take action, in part because of partisanship. The FEC has six members -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- and four commissioners would have to agree to pursue a case against CNN, necessitating at least some degree of bipartisanship. The Biden campaign clearly doesn't want Kennedy on stage, so it may be unlikely that any of the Democrats would break ranks to join three Republicans to vote to move forward with a case -- if the three Republicans had any interest in doing that. (While there has been a recent run of bipartisan agreements among the Republican trio and one Democratic member to loosen some campaign finance rules, Muller wasn't sure that trend was either sustainable or applicable to questions surrounding a debate.)\n\nMeanwhile, Muller noted past ideological opposition among Republican commissioners to FEC intervention in media-run debates. In 2015, a little-known GOP presidential contender named Mark Everson filed an unsuccessful FEC complaint against Fox News over the broadcaster's choice to change its preestablished criteria for qualification to the first Republican primary debate of the 2016 cycle. The newsiest part of the proceedings was a 4-2 FEC vote determining that Fox News's debate rules had not violated the law. But another vote in the proceedings may have particular relevance here: All three GOP commissioners also felt the FEC regulations themselves were invalid and supported a separate motion that said the FEC lacked the power to investigate Fox News (the motion failed 3-3).\n\n\"The three Republican members said, 'We think there's a First Amendment issue here, and we can't even get involved in the first place,'\" Muller told me. \"Who are we to tell the campaigns or debate organizations what they can and can't do as a media entity?\"\n\nEven if four commissioners agreed to move forward with a case, time is running short for the FEC to issue a ruling to compel CNN to put Kennedy on the stage. Even if such an order came just before the debate, CNN could challenge it in court, which could push any resolution beyond June 27. And a ruling that came after the CNN debate (i.e., issuing a fine on CNN) wouldn't help Kennedy in that debate, or in the next general election debate that ABC News plans to host in September. By then, the matter of whether Kennedy has sufficient ballot access should be unambiguous.\n\nKennedy is trying to become the first third-party or independent presidential candidate to make a general election debate since Ross Perot in 1992, but barring unexpected and swift action by the FEC, it looks like he'll have to hope for success in September instead.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the first presidential debate, hosted by CNN next week, officially setting up a head-to-head clash between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nCNN published a report Thursday morning that the networks' window for candidates to meet the criteria for the June 27 debate in Atlanta closed just after midnight Eastern Time, with Biden and Trump meeting the constitutional thresholds, of qualification and voting. A CNN spokesperson confirmed that Kennedy was not eligible.\n\nKennedy had failed to meet CNN's 15% threshold in at least four approved national polls, reaching that mark in only three polls before the deadline. He also failed to meet the network's voting criteria, which required candidates to gain access to enough states to win 270 electoral votes, a significant task for a third party at this point in the election cycle.\n\nAccording to an NBC News analysis, Kennedy is currently on the ballot in 10 states, but is being held pending verification or application windows in a handful of others.\n\nKennedy's absence from the stage next week will be a blow to his long-running campaign as he seeks to gain ground on presumptive major party nominees.\n\n\"My exclusion from the debate by Presidents Biden and Trump is undemocratic, un-American and cowardly,\" Kennedy said in a statement Thursday afternoon. \"Americans want an independent leader who will break the two-party duopoly. They want a president who will heal divisions, restore the middle class, relax the war machine, and end the chronic disease epidemic.\n\nLast month, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against CNN and the Biden and Trump campaigns, alleging that the manner in which they organized the June 27 presidential debate was illegal. Stefanie Spear, the campaign's press secretary, said she was considering further legal action ahead of the evening's debate.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly said he has no problem debating RFK Jr. and believes any candidate qualified for the ballot should be allowed to make his case to American voters, he said Thursday Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. It is Joe Biden and the Democrats who are using financial and legal resources to keep RFK off the ballot because they know RFK Jr. is a radical leftist who gets more votes from Biden than from President Trump.\n\nKennedy has already used the prospect of his omission from the stage to claim that the election was rigged against political outsiders, with his campaign booking $100,000 in television ads on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy still has a chance to qualify for the September 10 debate, hosted by ABC News. This debate has the same voting access and voting criteria as CNN, although it is unclear when the voting window will open. It will also give Kennedy more time to gain access to more ballots across the country.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his long-shot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Kennedy called his exclusion from the debate \u201cundemocratic, un-American, and cowardly\u201d.\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what is anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to take part in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totalling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but will not be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until August 29.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15 per cent in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15 per cent in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a message on Thursday seeking comment on CNN\u2019s announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on September 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the non-partisan commission that has organised debates for nearly four decades.\n\nAfter winning a coin toss, Biden\u2019s campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers\u2019 screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN.

Kennedy Jr. missed the deadline to qualify for the first 2024 U.S. presidential debate hosted by CNN, leading to his exclusion. Kennedy criticized the decision as undemocratic and vowed to pursue legal action against CNN and the campaigns of Biden and Trump.\n\nIndependent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is unlikely to participate in 2024's first U.S. presidential debate after missing a deadline to meet criteria set by hosting news organization CNN.\n\nCNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery and host of the June 27 debate, said only President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump had met its conditions to take part ahead of a 12 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) Thursday deadline. \"Presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally agreed to their demand,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \"My exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nThe conditions included appearing on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and also garnering at least 15% voter support in four separate national polls. Kennedy had received at least 15% in only three accepted polls to date and, by CNN's tally, had qualified for the ballot in just six states. That would not be enough to win the presidency.\n\nKennedy had argued the TV network's standards were being applied unfairly and intended to keep him off the stage with candidates who would prefer a one-on-one race. The Kennedy campaign asked that the Federal Election Commission take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the June 27 debate unless it makes changes. The FEC declined to comment.\n\n\"If the debate goes forward without Mr. Kennedy, the Kennedy campaign intends to pursue this issue for as long as it takes to obtain justice against these illegal acts,\" the campaign said in a statement on Thursday. For the debate, Trump will get the final word, CNN reported on Thursday, after a coin flip to determine podium placement and the order of closing statements.\n\nBiden's campaign chose to select the right podium position, which means the Democratic president will be on the right side of television viewers' screens and his Republican rival will be on viewers' left, CNN said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2008 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. said CNN's upcoming presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump violates federal campaign law.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign on May 28 filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging \"flagrant violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act,\" in the June 27 debate.\n\nKennedy claims the debates are functioning as illegal campaign contributions from CNN to Biden's and Trump's campaigns. CNN, Biden's campaign, and Trump's campaign have yet to respond to the complaint.\n\nCNN's criteria for inclusion to the debate required a candidate to appear on enough state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold as well as hitting 15% in four national polls.\n\n\"Though not impossible in Kennedy's case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements. Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes,\" CNN said last week.\n\nKennedy is arguing CNN is not holding the Biden and Trump campaigns to the same criteria. Since Biden and Trump are the presumptive nominees and have not officially been nominated by their parties, their names are not certified to appear on every state ballot, Kennedy argued.\n\nKennedy's campaign is also claiming Biden's camp has demanded he be excluded while Trump's campaign has received assurances Kennedy would not be on the stage. Without Kennedy's participation, he said CNN is willfully violating campaign finance laws.\n\n\"CNN, and every member of CNN who is participating in planning, executing, and holding this debate, is at risk of prosecution, as happened to Michael Cohen, for violating campaign finance laws,\" Kennedy's campaign said. \"This risk is now acute given that any further violation would be knowing and willful, and thus could carry with it serious jail time.\"\n\nKennedy is asking the FEC to order CNN to cancel the debate until it complies with the Federal Election Campaign Act or dismiss his complaint, so he has an opportunity to obtain judicial review of the FEC's actions related to the complaint.\n\nKennedy has petitioned to appear on the ballot in 18 states, including California, Oklahoma, Michigan, North Carolina, Iowa, Nebraska, Hawaii, Utah, Idaho, New York, New Hampshire, and Nevada, according to the campaign.\n\nSam Barron \u2709\n\nSam Barron has almost two decades of experience covering a wide range of topics including politics, crime and business.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_barron@newsmax.com", "name": "Sam Barron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate,\" the statement read.\n\nCandidates must also get \"at least 15 percent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards for reporting\" to participate in the debate.\n\nCNN issued a long list of polls that meet its standards for debate eligibility, including surveys from CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, the Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to his campaign, Mr. Kennedy has met the requirements for three of those polls. Last week, he gained 17 percent support in a Marquette Law School survey. In April, he gained 16 percent backing in CNN and Quinnipiac polls.\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has overseen all presidential forums since 1988 until this year.\n\nIn a May 15 letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, President Biden's campaign said he would not participate in the commission's planned fall debates, citing the preference for earlier dates.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign also sent a letter to the commission last month stating it also prefers earlier debates.\n\nMr. Kennedy has not commented about the CNN debate this week, but on May 15, he expressed his dismay on social media at being excluded.\n\n\"Presidents Trump and Biden are colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70 percent say they do not want. They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Anderson_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Anderson (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, though not all have confirmed his name will be listed. California, for example, won't certify any candidates until Aug. 29.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20.

It will be the first in-person face off between Biden and Trump since they stood alongside one another on debate stages during the 2020 cycle. There won't be a studio audience.\n\nCNN said there will be two commercial breaks during the debate, and candidates will not be allowed to consult with other members of their campaign during that time.\n\nThe network also noted that candidates' podiums and positions will be determined by a coin flip, their mics will be muted outside of speaking time, and they will only be provided with a pen, a notepad and a bottle of water.\n\nCandidates will not be allowed to bring props or prepared notes.\n\nKennedy has filed an election complaint accusing CNN of conspiring with Biden and Trump to exclude Kennedy from the debate. CNN denies the accusations.\n\nRELATED: CNN finalizes rules for first Biden vs. Trump debate\n\nIt's unclear whether Kennedy will take any further action regarding the debate.\n\nThe second debate between Biden and Trump is set for Sept. 10.

The deadline for candidates to qualify is midnight Wednesday. Adding to the challenge, federal business will be largely stalled due to the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nIn late May, Mr. Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN's debate setup constitutes an illegal campaign contribution to Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kennedy, CNN imposed \"different criteria\" for him to participate. The complaint demands that the FEC take action by Thursday and prevent the debate from proceeding unless it complies with the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\nThe situation is unusual.

That would not be enough to win the presidency. He had argued the TV network's standards were being applied unfairly and intended to keep him off the stage with candidates who would prefer a one-on-one race.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign asked that the Federal Election Commission take action by Thursday and keep CNN, Biden and Trump from holding the June 27 debate unless it makes changes. The FEC declined to comment.\n\nAlso Read: | Why Robert F Kennedy Jr's US elections candidacy has Joe Biden sweating\n\n\"If the debate goes forward without Mr. Kennedy, the Kennedy campaign intends to pursue this issue for as long as it takes to obtain justice against these illegal acts,\" the campaign said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nFor the debate, Trump will get the final word, CNN reported on Thursday, after a coin flip to determine podium placement and the order of closing statements. Biden's campaign chose to select the right podium position, which means the Democratic president will be on the right side of television viewers' screens and his Republican rival will be on viewers' left, CNN said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. won't be on CNN's debate stage", "body": "Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the first presidential debate.\n\nKennedy did not meet CNN's June 27 debate requirements, the network announced Thursday, which included a polling minimum and access to enough state's presidential ballots to theoretically be elected president. The deadline to qualify was June 20 at 12:01 am.\n\nThat means Kennedy will not join President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in Atlanta next week.\n\n\"My exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly. Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly,\" Kennedy said in a statement. He also falsely claimed that debate is illegal.\n\nIn an effort to qualify, Kennedy filed a legal complaint to the Federal Election Commission. But the agency has not taken any action.\n\nThe first presidential debate of 2024 breaks a long tradition of these events being coordinated by the Commission on Presidential Debates. CNN's debate was scheduled without the commission, and it is happening earlier than previous presidential debates.\n\nBut the cable network did borrow its three main qualifying criteria from the commission: eligibility per the Constitution (35 years old and a native-born citizen), a polling requirement to reach at least 15 percent support in four surveys from respected pollsters and officially making the ballot in enough states to theoretically win 270 Electoral College votes.\n\nCNN declined to comment on Kennedy's exclusion from the debate after the qualifying deadline passed.\n\nKennedy has drawn some of the highest support for a third-party candidate in polls since Ross Perot's independent presidential run in 1992. But he only broke 15 percent support in three polls and needed to do so in four, according to POLITICO's tracking of qualifying polls.\n\nThe campaign has also successfully collected enough signatures to potentially get Kennedy's name printed on the ballot in several states, including those with significant signature requirements like Texas and New York. But most of those states haven't certified his petitions to confirm that he is on the ballot, and many won't do so until late summer.\n\nKennedy and his campaign staffers claimed they would qualify for the debate despite these hurdles.\n\n\"Thrilled that Presidents Biden and Trump have finally agreed to a debate!\" campaign manager Amaryllis Fox Kennedy wrote on X. \"We anticipate fulfilling all participation criteria by June 20th and look forward to offering American voters the three-way debate they deserve.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. likely won't be on the debate stage next week.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nIs Virginia really an asset for Trump? By Steve Kornacki\n\nThere are several storylines of national importance in today's Virginia primary. But when it comes to the presidential race this fall, the consensus view is that the Old Dominion will be suspense-free.\n\nThe saga of Virginia's transition from red redoubt to safe blue state is a familiar one, marked by the suburbs of Washington and Richmond and accelerated by the emergence of Donald Trump. It looked like this:\n\nAnd yet, even as Trump once again leads the GOP poll, two recent polls from Fox News and Roanoke College found him tied in a head-to-head race with President Joe Biden in Virginia. When several third-party candidates were included, Biden took a 1-point lead in Fox's poll and a 2-point lead in Roanokes.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nThis is obviously a limited sample of polls, and while the Trump campaign is making noise trying to bring the state into play, it has yet to demonstrate that it will back up this narrative with a full-throated push.\n\nStill, if these early numbers showing a close race persist, the Electoral College implications would be significant.\n\nCurrently, Trump's clearest path to 270 electoral votes is to reclaim Georgia and Arizona and flip Nevada, all states with diverse populations where Trump's polling gains among non-white voters are expected to boost him . Even if he picks those three, he'll likely still need to win back one of the three Big Ten states Biden flipped in 2020, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, states with higher concentrations of white voters. But if Trump won Virginia, he could take back the White House without any of those northern states.\n\nOf course, that's a very big if. Current polls paint a clear enough picture of why the state might be competitive. Biden's job approval stands at 43% in the Fox poll and 35% in the Roanoke survey. And when respondents in the Roanoke poll were asked how they now view the four years of Trump's presidency, 44% rated them pretty good, compared to just 25% who said the same for Biden's term.\n\nTrump's gains among non-white voters in national polls can also be seen here. The Fox poll puts him at 25% among Black voters, up from the 10% the 2020 Virginia exit poll pegged him at. The state also has a significant population of Latinos and Asian Americans.\n\nBut when fall arrives, things could be different in Virginia. Trump himself remains extremely unpopular (a 55% unfavorable rating in the Fox poll).\n\nAnd there is a higher concentration of college degrees among the state's white adult population than the national average. Not only has this demographic become increasingly Democratic of late, but they have also been intensely anti-Trump, showing up in disproportionately high levels of non-presidential elections, motivated by every opportunity to express their discontent towards the former president.\n\nIt's a trend that could help Biden outperform his poll numbers in a state like Virginia.\n\nWhy RFK Jr. likely won't join Biden and Trump in next week's debateBy Katherine Koretski and Ben Kamisar\n\nAs Biden and Trump prepare next week for their first face-off in nearly four years, there's one wild card they probably won't have to account for: a third candidate on stage.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. appears unlikely to qualify for the CNN debate when the deadline passes this week. He has yet to reach the 15% threshold in at least four approved national polls, having reached that threshold in only three so far.\n\nBut more importantly, Kennedy is almost guaranteed to fail to meet the network's ballot entry criteria, because qualifying in enough states to win 270 electoral votes is a herculean task for a candidate not from a major party at this early stage in the electoral calendar. And on top of that, Kennedy's campaign did not submit its ballot access petitions at the pace necessary to secure voting slates by the June 20 deadline, although it clearly made progress toward qualifying for the next debate in the fall.\n\nThat means Kennedy is almost certain to watch the debate between Biden and Trump next Thursday from the sidelines, depriving independents of earned media and a chance to elevate his campaign in the long run. Instead, Kennedy appears ready to leverage his omission to claim that elections are rigged against political outsiders. His campaign raised $100,000 in national television advertising on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy faces an uphill battle to gain ballot access in all 50 states before November, but at a campaign event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this weekend he said he would be on on the ballot across the country within four weeks.\n\nThe independent candidate has already qualified to appear on ballots in nine states, accounting for 139 electoral votes, according to NBC News analysis and interviews with state officials. Her campaign claims it has also gathered enough signatures to exceed the requirements outlined in CNN's criteria, but in many cases the signatures have not been officially submitted for verification, a process that can take weeks (or even more).\n\nIn some states, the windows to submit these signatures are not even open yet. Which is why the debate window is closing on Kennedy, awaiting last-minute legal action from state bureaucrats.\n\nLearn more\n\nToday's headlines Voters are casting their votes: It's primary day in Virginia and Oklahoma (and primary runoff day in Georgia).

So when CNN announced it was holding an unusually early presidential debate on June 27, it became supremely important for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to make the stage alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump and display his viability at a time when many voters are unhappy with the 2020 rematch. There was some initial optimism in Kennedy land when he quickly notched three of the four required national polls showing him with at least 15 percent of the vote. But CNN has now announced he didn't make the cut: \"The debate qualification window closed at 12:00:01 a.m. ET on Thursday, with Biden and Trump meeting the constitutional, ballot qualification and polling thresholds set by the network.\"\n\nThat fourth qualifying poll for RFK Jr. never arrived, but it may have been irrelevant since Kennedy missed another debate-qualification criterion by a mile, as the New York Times noted:\n\nMr. Kennedy also needed to be officially on the ballot in enough states that he could win 270 votes in the Electoral College -- the threshold for winning the presidency. As of Thursday, Mr. Kennedy had less than a third of that number, according to an analysis by The New York Times. He is officially on the ballot in only six states -- California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah -- totaling 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nThe ballot access requirement was significantly more onerous for an independent presidential candidate than the polling requirement.\n\nKennedy vociferously objected to the ballot-access requirement on grounds that he was being required to gain a certified spot on state ballots while Biden and Trump were simply assumed to have achieved it as \"presumptive\" nominees of major parties. This was a plausible argument in the court of public opinion (his campaign events frequently featured supporters waving \"Let Him Debate!\" signs). But the Kennedy campaign's effort to persuade the Federal Election Commission to intervene on grounds that CNN was making an illegal corporate contribution to the Biden and Trump campaigns was much more of a reach and did not succeed. Team Kennedy is still threatening legal action, but there's not much reason to believe it will stop or change the debate.\n\nKennedy will have another shot at a debate qualification on September 10, when ABC is scheduled to hold a presidential debate with participation criteria that look very similar to CNN's. The bigger question is whether his campaign will have lost crucial momentum by then. In the month of June alone, his support has dropped from 10.4 percent to 7.7 percent in the RealClearPolitics national polling averages of a five-way contest. His fundraising has also hit a slough with only $2.6 million in donations in May. Yes, his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, has provided crucial financial support, but it's unclear how much of her fortune she'll be willing or able to expend.\n\nAdd in the customary fade in support that virtually every non-major-party presidential candidate has experienced, and you can see why the Kennedy campaign staked a lot on becoming the first independent candidate to make a debate stage since Ross Perot in 1992. As it is, he'll be on the sidelines complaining, as NBC News reports:\n\nKennedy appears poised to leverage his omission to argue the campaign is rigged against political outsiders. His campaign has booked $100,000 in national TV advertising on the day of the debate.\n\nSure enough, when CNN announced his exclusion, he put out an angry statement:\n\nMy exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate\n\nis undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly. Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly.\n\nIt's just one more conspiracy the Kennedy-Shanahan campaign will deplore as it struggles to remain a factor in the 2024 presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_kilgore@nymag.com", "name": "Ed Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. that he has qualified for enough state ballots to participate in next week's presidential debate on CNN, a Washington Post survey of state election officials found Tuesday that that's not the case.\n\nSo far, only Delaware, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah election officials have said Kennedy will appear on their ballots, and he is likely to appear on the California and Hawaii ballots, the survey found. Those states total 100 electoral votes, falling far short of CNN's required 270 -- the number a candidate needs to win the election.\n\nKennedy's campaign has spent months gathering the minimum number of signatures that states require to get an independent candidate on the ballot, but many election officials told the Post that they would still need several more weeks to certify those petitions.\n\nHe also hasn't met CNN's requirement of earning 15% support in four national polls, though it's theoretically possible that could change before Thursday's deadline to meet the debate requirements.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging that CNN is colluding with President Joe Biden and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump to exclude him from the debate. A CNN spokesperson pushed back, saying, \"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy's campaigndisputed the Post's findings.\n\n\"The bottom line is he is eligible for more electoral votes than both Presidents Trump and Biden since they have not yet been nominated by their parties,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.\n\nCandidates from major parties do not need to petition for ballot access like independents do. But Kennedy's campaign still takes issue, citing language from the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\"The FEC has made clear that the phrase 'presumptive nominee' is 'not in the FEC's debate regulation,'\" the campaign spokesperson said. \"Failure to use objective criteria renders the debate a campaign contribution, subject to strict donation limits, therefore CNN is violating federal law.\"\n\nKennedy, a potential spoiler candidate for Biden or Trump, is best known for promoting anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, including the false claims that vaccines can cause autism.

Kennedy, Jr. to qualify for next week's US presidential debate hosted by CNN. His campaign must demonstrate no later than Thursday at midnight that RFK, Jr. is on enough statewide ballots and meets a specific polling threshold to participate, but it's not looking likely.\n\nThe Atlanta-based cable network requires that participating candidates be legally able to run for president -- per Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution -- in addition to filing a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both clear these bars -- and so do candidates Cornel West, Jill Stein, and RFK Jr.\n\nThe network also requires that debaters appear on enough state ballots to reach 270 electoral votes needed to win a presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate approved national polls of registered or likely voters.\n\nSince early June, RFK Jr.'s team has claimed he is on the ballot in enough states to take the stage. But the numbers don't add up.\n\nFor months, RFK Jr. has been strategically navigating how to get on ballots across the country, and each state has specific election laws concerning independent candidates. Typically, those trying to get into the mix have two options: gain enough signatures to petition to be on the ballot or be nominated by an established political party in the state. Kennedy has been trying both.\n\nAccording to reporting by The Washington Post, a \"survey of state election officials found Kennedy is not on the ballot in several states where he has claimed he is -- and he will not reach the requirement by Thursday's deadline.\"\n\nElection officials in Utah, Delaware, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Tennessee have confirmed Kennedy's place on the ballot, and CNN has counted California and Hawaii, where Kennedy is poised to be the nominee of minor parties. Altogether, that's 100 electoral votes. He is also yet to meet the polling requirements.\n\nA ballot effort tracker map on Kennedy's campaign website highlights 23 states as \"Petitioning Complete\" and claims that the independent candidate is eligible for 310 electoral votes. A \"We're on the ballot\" message pops up when clicking on a highlighted state. Yet, as New York Board of Elections spokeswoman Kathleen McGrath told the Post, \"'petitioning complete' is accurate, the statement below, 'We're on the ballot' is premature.\"\n\nRFK Jr.'s campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear told the Post that even questioning Kennedy's failure to meet the 270 electoral votes requirement was \"nonsensical.\"\n\nThe debate on June 27 at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, is the first time in a long time that the presumptive 2024 presidential nominees, Biden and Trump, will be addressing each other in the same room. Kennedy -- who claimed his brain was partially eaten by a worm that crawled inside and died, and then later said that he could eat five more brain worms and \"still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate\" -- would really like to be there.\n\nWhile Biden and Trump must also meet CNN's polling and electoral vote prerequisites, it's a bit different for them. As the presumptive candidates for both of their parties, most states will automatically allow them ballot access without having to petition, a CNN spokesperson has clarified.\n\nIn May, RFK Jr.'s campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN, Biden, and Trump colluded and engaged in \"flagrant violations\" of the law to keep Kennedy off the stage.\n\nThe campaign called on the FCC to take action before the Thursday deadline, according to a June 18 press release, and claimed that \"CNN, and every member of CNN who is participating in planning, executing, and holding this debate, is at risk of prosecution. \"This risk,\" the release continues, \"is now acute given that any further violation would be knowing and willful, and thus could carry with it serious jail time.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is he is eligible for more electoral votes than both Presidents Trump and Biden,\" Spear wrote in an email to the Post.\n\nFor the candidates who do get to take the stage next week, CNN has implemented some other rules, too.\n\nThe 90-minute debate, hosted by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will feature mics that can be muted and have no studio audience, as part of the moderator's effort to \"use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" according to the network. There will be no opening statement, and no prewritten notes will be allowed. Each candidate will be given a pen, notepad, and a bottle of water at their podium, chosen by the flip of a coin.\n\nWhile CNN said on Saturday that it's \"not impossible\" for Kennedy to meet the guidelines, time is running out. And for RFK Jr., this is personal.\n\n\"Presidents Trump and Biden are colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up,\" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly claimed that he appears on enough statewide ballots to qualify for next week's debate between President Biden and Donald Trump and has threatened to sue CNN for not letting him on the stage.\n\nBut a Washington Post survey of state election officials found Kennedy is not on the ballot in several states where he has claimed he is -- and he will not reach the requirement by Thursday's deadline to qualify for the debate. The rules of CNN's debate indicate candidates must appear on enough ballots nationwide to earn the requisite 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, along with earning 15 percent support in four national polls.\n\nElection officials in Utah, Delaware, Oklahoma, Michigan and Tennessee have confirmed Kennedy will be on the ballot. Additionally, CNN has counted California and Hawaii, where Kennedy is the presumptive nominee of minor parties where the states have either not certified him or received paperwork. Those states add up to 100 electoral votes. Kennedy also has not yet met the polling requirement for the debate, though could if a qualifying poll is released before Thursday.\n\nKennedy intended to get on all 50 states' ballots quickly as he sought to gain national attention that would come from sharing a debate stage with the two major-party candidates. Kennedy has pointed to his exclusion as evidence that he has been treated unfairly by the parties and the media.\n\nRead more: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/18/rfk-jr-presidential-debate/#", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Bush and Arkansas Democratic Governor Bill Clinton. Clinton won the election but did not receive a mandate.\n\nCNN's debate is slated for 9 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 27. \"State of the Union\" anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash have been selected as moderators.\n\nIt is expected to be a 90-minute event with two commercial breaks during which staff are not allowed to interact with their candidate.

Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the CNN presidential debate on June 27 by the network's Thursday deadline, according to the outlet, a significant blow to his independent presidential bid that will deny him a coveted national stage alongside President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nQualifying for the CNN debate, one of two presidential debates scheduled before Election Day, would have been a plum prize for the Kennedy campaign. More than 73 million people watched the first debate between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump in 2020, and Mr. Kennedy would have had the opportunity to confront his opponents in front of an extensive national audience.\n\nNo third-party or independent presidential candidate has been on the national debate stage since 1992, when the Texas billionaire Ross Perot's self-funded campaign gained enough momentum to earn him a spot alongside President George Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in three debates in the final weeks before the election.\n\nBut Mr. Kennedy failed to meet two criteria. In the face of mounting challenges before the deadline, Mr. Kennedy had accused CNN of colluding with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him from the debate, and filed a complaint to the Federal Election Commission accusing the network of violating campaign finance law.\n\nCNN has denied those accusations. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump have a mutual interest in keeping Mr. Kennedy off the debate stage, as he is drawing support away from both candidates -- and both campaigns are concerned about the potential for him to swing the election in key battleground states.\n\nTo qualify, Mr. Kennedy needed to earn at least 15 percent support in four approved national polls.

Kennedy Jr. did not qualify for the debate stage.\n\n\"The debate qualification window closed at 12:00:01 a.m. ET on Thursday, with Biden and Trump meeting the constitutional, ballot qualification and polling thresholds set by the network,\" CNN stated.\n\nPer CNN:\n\nIn order to qualify for participation, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAccording to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards for reporting.\n\nPolls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nBiden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements.\n\nCNN released additional details about the debate earlier this week.\n\nCNN Releases Additional Details For Trump-Biden Debate\n\nThe debate, moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will be 90 minutes and include two commercial breaks.\n\nCampaign staff may not interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks.\n\n\"Both candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip,\" CNN wrote.\n\n\"Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water,\" the outlet added.\n\nNBC News reports:\n\nLast month, Kennedy's campaign filed a Federal Election Commission complaint against CNN and the Biden and Trump campaigns, alleging the way they set up the June 27 presidential debate was illegal. Stefanie Spear, press secretary for the campaign, said it is \"considering\" further legal action ahead of debate night.\n\n\"President Trump said repeatedly he had no problem debating RFK Jr. and he believes any candidate who qualifies for the ballot should be allowed to make their case to America's voters,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday. \"It's Joe Biden and the Democrats who are using financial and legal resources to prevent RFK's access to the ballot because they know RFK Jr. is a radical leftist who pulls more votes from Biden than President Trump.\"\n\nKennedy has already used the prospect of his omission from the stage to argue the election is rigged against political outsiders, with his campaign booking $100,000 in TV ads on the day of the debate.\n\nKennedy still has a chance to qualify for the Sept. 10 debate, hosted by ABC News. That debate has the same ballot access and polling criteria as CNN's, although it's unclear when the polling window will open. That will also provide Kennedy with additional time to secure access on more ballots around the country.", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

As matters stand, Kennedy is only on the ballot in six states.\n\nThe debate will be hosted by CNN on June 27, and moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, who, according to a Kennedy campaign statement issued Thursday, could be headed to the big house.\n\n\"CNN's published debate criteria require that 'a candidate's name must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold,'\" the statement reads. \"CNN is holding Kennedy to this requirement but is not requiring Presidents Biden and Trump to meet this requirement by claiming they are each the 'presumptive nominee' of a political party.\"\n\nThe statement says CNN's \"presumptive nominee\" provision is \"not in the [Federal Election Commission's] debate regulation,\" which the campaign argues is against the law. In the next paragraph, things take a turn:\n\nThis means CNN, and every member of CNN who is participating in planning, executing, and holding this debate, is at risk of prosecution, as happened to Michael Cohen, for violating campaign finance laws. This risk is now acute given that any further violation would be knowing and willful, and thus could carry with it serious jail time.\n\nCNN and its staff are on clear notice, especially given the damning evidence that the Biden campaign has openly demanded Kennedy be excluded from the debates and Trump received assurances from CNN that Kennedy would be excluded.\n\nThe missive concludes by saying the campaign intends to pursue legal action against CNN for its \"un-American conduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won't be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.\n\nKennedy's campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the participation requirements were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN's announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.\n\nLast month, Biden and Trump agreed to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.\n\n___\n\nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app.\n\n(NewsNation) -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has missed the deadline to qualify for the CNN Presidential Debate set for next week.\n\nThe June 27 event marks the first debate in U.S. history between a sitting president, Democrat Joe Biden, and a former president -- his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump.\n\nTo be eligible for the debate, CNN said, candidates had to satisfy constitutional requirements to serve as president and file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn addition, CNN decided in May that all participants had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters meeting the news outlets' \"standards for reporting.\"\n\nOnly Biden and Trump met these requirements by the Thursday deadline given by CNN. Kennedy had complained that CNN said Biden and Trump met the ballot access requirements because they are their parties' presumptive nominees.\n\n\"The law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement,\" a CNN spokesperson told NewsNation in a statement. \"As an independent candidate, under applicable laws, RFK Jr. currently does not.\"\n\nAccording to NewsNation partner The Hill and Decision Desk HQ, as of Wednesday, Kennedy will officially appear on the presidential ballot in five states, meaning he could potentially get 40 electoral votes. Only three polls approved by CNN had Kennedy at 15%.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's doing anything to handicap him,\" Scott Tranter, an analyst and adviser to Decision Desk HQ, said to The Hill. \"I think they're just trying to do everything by the book.\"\n\nStill, Kennedy's campaign team requested the FEC intervene, with the independent candidate accusing CNN of \"colluding with the Biden and Trump campaigns\" to stop him from debating next week. Campaign workers for Kennedy claim they've collected enough signatures for ballot access in 18 other states, although those signatures still need to be verified.\n\n\"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that (Kennedy) will appear on the ballot in any state,\" the CNN spokesperson said. \"In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nKennedy's communications director Del Bigtree told NewsNation the campaign still plans on running ads during the debate.\n\n\"We believe that Bobby will be on that stage until proven otherwise. This is the most transparent candidate we've every seen,\" Bigtree said in a statement Thursday. \"We'll probably be making comments before the debate if he's not there, and after. This is all the process that America needs to recognize is corrupted. And Robert Kennedy is standing up to this corruption.\"", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. that he has qualified for enough state ballots to participate in next week's presidential debate on CNN, a Washington Post survey of state election officials found Tuesday that that's not the case.\n\nSo far, only Delaware, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah election officials have said Kennedy will appear on their ballots, and he is likely to appear on the California and Hawaii ballots, the survey found. Those states total 100 electoral votes, falling far short of CNN's required 270 -- the number a candidate needs to win the election.\n\nKennedy's campaign has spent months gathering the minimum number of signatures that states require to get an independent candidate on the ballot, but many election officials told the Post that they would still need several more weeks to certify those petitions.\n\nHe also hasn't met CNN's requirement of earning 15% support in four national polls, though it's theoretically possible that could change before Thursday's deadline to meet the debate requirements.\n\nLast month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging that CNN is colluding with President Joe Biden and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump to exclude him from the debate. A CNN spokesperson pushed back, saying, \"The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state.\"\n\nKennedy's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his debate qualifications. But campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear disputed the Post's findings.\n\n\"The bottom line is he is eligible for more electoral votes than both Presidents Trump and Biden,\" Spear wrote in an email, apparently referencing the fact that neither Biden nor Trump has yet been nominated by their parties. However, candidates from major parties do not need to petition for ballot access like independents do.\n\nKennedy, a potential spoiler candidate for Biden or Trump, is best known for promoting anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, including the false claims that vaccines can cause autism. He has gone so far as to compare vaccination programs to the Holocaust.

He also falsely claimed that debate is illegal.\n\nIn an effort to qualify, Kennedy filed a legal complaint to the Federal Election Commission. But the agency has not taken any action.\n\nThe first presidential debate of 2024 breaks a long tradition of these events being coordinated by the Commission on Presidential Debates. CNN's debate was scheduled without the commission, and it is happening earlier than previous presidential debates.\n\nBut the cable network did borrow its three main qualifying criteria from the commission: eligibility per the Constitution (35 years old and a native-born citizen), a polling requirement to reach at least 15 percent support in four surveys from respected pollsters and officially making the ballot in enough states to theoretically win 270 Electoral College votes.\n\nCNN declined to comment on Kennedy's exclusion from the debate after the qualifying deadline passed.\n\nKennedy has drawn some of the highest support for a third-party candidate in polls since Ross Perot's independent presidential run in 1992. But he only broke 15 percent support in three polls and needed to do so in four, according to POLITICO's tracking of qualifying polls.\n\nThe campaign has also successfully collected enough signatures to potentially get Kennedy's name printed on the ballot in several states, including those with significant signature requirements like Texas and New York. But most of those states haven't certified his petitions to confirm that he is on the ballot, and many won't do so until late summer.\n\nKennedy and his campaign staffers claimed they would qualify for the debate despite these hurdles.\n\n\"Thrilled that Presidents Biden and Trump have finally agreed to a debate!\" campaign manager Amaryllis Fox Kennedy wrote on X. \"We anticipate fulfilling all participation criteria by June 20th and look forward to offering American voters the three-way debate they deserve.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. failed Thursday to meet the qualifications to join Democratic President Joe Biden and former Republican President Donald Trump at the first of two 2024 presidential debates set for June 27 on CNN.\n\nUnder qualifying terms for the 90-minute debate on the news channel, Kennedy needed to earn at least 15% support in four approved national polls, but he only hit that mark in three polls.\n\nIn addition, Kennedy, an environmental activist and COVID-19 vaccination opponent, also needed to be officially on the ballot in enough states to show that he could theoretically win 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum to win the presidency. But currently, Kennedy has only qualified to be on the ballot in six states with 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nNational state-by-state polling has shown that Kennedy, if he's on the ballot with both Biden and Trump, and possibly other challengers, would draw some support from both Biden and Trump, often to different degrees depending on the state.\n\nTraditionally, the first of the presidential debates every four years draws the largest television audience. More than 73 million tuned in for the first of two Biden-Trump encounters in 2020. As such, Kennedy had hoped to introduce himself to more voters and offer a contrast to the two established candidates.\n\nAfter being excluded, he complained in a statement, \"Presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally agreed to their demand. My exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\n\"Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly,\" Kennedy said. \"They want a president who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, unwind the war machine, and end the chronic disease epidemic.\"\n\nNo third-party or independent presidential candidate has been on the national presidential debate stage since 1992, when Texas billionaire Ross Perot, who was self-funding his campaign, gained enough support to appear alongside President George H.W.

In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate,\" the statement read.\n\nCandidates must also get \"at least 15 percent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards for reporting\" to participate in the debate.\n\nCNN issued a long list of polls that meet its standards for debate eligibility, including surveys from CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, the Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to his campaign, Mr. Kennedy has met the requirements for three of those polls. Last week, he gained 17 percent support in a Marquette Law School survey. In April, he gained 16 percent backing in CNN and Quinnipiac polls.\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has overseen all presidential forums since 1988 until this year.\n\nIn a May 15 letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, President Biden's campaign said he would not participate in the commission's planned fall debates, citing the preference for earlier dates.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign also sent a letter to the commission last month stating it also prefers earlier debates.\n\n\"Presidents Trump and Biden are colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70 percent say they do not want. They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. criticized his exclusion from the CNN presidential debate on June 27 as \"undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly\" in a Thursday post on X.\n\nThe 2024 independent presidential candidate expressed his frustration, saying that \"Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly.\" Despite his aspirations to directly challenge Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Kennedy, hailing from the historically Democratic Kennedy family, did not qualify for the debate.\n\nWhat Happened: An update from CNN on Thursday confirmed that solely Biden and Trump would face off in the June debate, after Kennedy did not meet certain qualifications required to appear on stage.\n\nOne of the parameters set by CNN required participants to appear on enough state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold. Kennedy is only on the ballot in six states thus far -- California, Michigan, Utah, Oklahoma, Hawaii and Delaware -- totaling 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nWhy it Matters: Kennedy's 2024 campaign could play spoiler to both Biden and Trump. Kennedy has staked out conservative positions on issues such as vaccines and culture war issues and liberal positions on climate activism. In 2023, Kennedy's comments that the COVID-19 pandemic was genetically engineered to spare Ashkenazi Jews were widely decried as anti-Semitic.\n\nThe last third-party presidential candidate to qualify for a debate was Ross Perot in 1992. Many believe that Perot played spoiler to George H.W. Bush's campaign, propelling Bill Clinton to the White House.\n\nAlthough Biden and Trump do not have a vested interest in facing off against Kennedy, the Independent candidate himself has repeatedly expressed a desire to participate in a debate. In May, Kennedy asked Elon Musk to host a debate on Musk's social media platform X.\n\nOther members of the Kennedy family endorsed Biden in April.\n\nRead Next: Nvidia Analyst: Stock Still 'Quite Inexpensive,' Expects Chipmaker To Maintain 80%-Plus Share As AI Market 'Triples' Over Coming Years\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Mr. Kennedy has not met the network's requirements to participate and appears unlikely to do so by the end of the day Wednesday.\n\nThe first problem for Mr. Kennedy is that he has not attained ballot access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes, one of two requirements set by CNN. So far, Mr. Kennedy has only officially qualified for ballot access in six states accounting for 89 electoral votes, though the Kennedy campaign claims to have completed the required petitioning in states accounting for 310 electoral votes.\n\nFor instance, the campaign claimed to have gained ballot access in Mississippi, saying that his \"We the People\" party was \"officially on the ballot.\" Yet the secretary of state there said that it had not yet filed the necessary documents to gain ballot access.\n\nCNN is also requiring candidates to receive 15 percent support in at least four qualifying polls in order to appear on the debate stage. So far, Mr. Kennedy has received at least 15 percent support in three such surveys.\n\nMr. Kennedy's campaign has also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that CNN's requirements violate federal campaign finance laws. The complaint hinges on the fact that neither President Biden nor President Trump are yet technically the nominees of their respective parties, and thus do not qualify to appear on any ballots, let alone enough to reach 270 electoral votes.\n\nBoth the Biden and the Trump campaigns have pointed out that they are their party's presumptive nominees. However, the FEC does not generally make this distinction in this context, with the Commission on Presidential Debates noting, \"Until the conventions take place, we don't know who the official nominees will be.\"\n\nWhile the FEC declined to dismiss the complaint, it's not clear whether it will be resolved ahead of the debate. The Kennedy campaign has, though, asked the FEC to prevent CNN and the other campaigns from holding the debate until they \"come into compliance\" with the relevant rules.\n\nWhile Mr. Kennedy has called on the FEC to put the debate on hold unless he is allowed to participate, any enforcement action from the commission would have to overcome the notorious deadlock at the FEC's board. The commission is made up of six commissioners, three Republicans and three Democrats, meaning the board is deadlocked the vast majority of the time it has to vote on an action.\n\nIn a 2017 report, the FEC commissioner, Ann Ravel, cited deadlock as a key factor in the \"unlikelihood of draining the swamp,\" noting that for \"nearly every case of major significance over the past several years, the Commission has deadlocked.\"\n\nYet a Republican commissioner, Sean Cooksey, has called the deadlock an \"important structural feature\" of the commission that prevents it from engaging in \"partisan\" investigations.\n\nMr. Kennedy's efforts to participate in the debate aside, Mr. Biden and Trump are set to participate in an unusually early presidential debate with a set of strict rules agreed to by both campaigns.\n\nIn a memo outlining the Biden campaign's debate strategy, Mr. Biden's campaign chairwoman, Jen O'Malley Dillon, described a three-pronged attack on Trump, highlighting how he \"continues to embrace political violence,\" \"wants to go even further\" on abortion restrictions, and how his economic plan \"would make him and his friends richer and jack up costs for the middle class.\"\n\nSince then, Mr. Biden's campaign's communications director, Micahel Tyler, has highlighted Trump's criminality and his campaign's focus on retribution, raising the question of whether Mr. Biden will criticize Trump for his recent felony conviction. \"Trump approaches the first debate as a convicted felon who continues to prove that he will do anything and harm anyone if it means more power and vengeance for Donald Trump,\" Mr. Tyler said.\n\nAt the same time, Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, has said that the \"contrast between President Trump's strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden's weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week.\"\n\nAn advisor to Trump, Jason Miller, has also suggested that Mr. Biden will be \"shot up with chemicals,\" something conservative pundits like Fox News's Sean Hannity have suggested ahead of the debate as well.\n\n\"President Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\" Mr. Miller said in a statement.\n\nOne open question is whether Trump will invoke the recent conviction of Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for lying on a form about his drug use while buying a gun. The catch is that, unlike in 2020, when Mr. Biden famously told Trump to \"shut up, man,\" the candidates will have to convey their political messages and air their personal grievances under a new set of rules.\n\nAccording to CNN rules, each candidate's microphone will be muted in order to prevent interruption while the other is speaking -- a major shift from earlier presidential debates and even from recent GOP primary debates.\n\nThere will also be no studio audience and candidates will not be allowed to have pre-written notes, though they will be given note-taking tools. Candidates will also not be allowed to get help from aides during breaks.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash of CNN and will run for about 90 minutes, including two commercial breaks.\n\nNeither Mr. Kennedy's campaign nor the FEC immediately responded to requests for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_payne@nysun.com", "name": "Russell Payne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Anderson_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Anderson (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. is unlikely to stand on the first debate stage next week, a setback that could throw him off course in his race against President Biden and former President Trump.\n\nThe independent candidate is determined to debate his Democratic and Republican rivals in Atlanta on June 27. But he's running out of time to make the polling and delegate benchmarks that Biden and Trump have already surpassed before Thursday's midnight deadline.\n\nFailing to meet the eligibility criteria would be the first big blow for the third-party candidate struggling to remain relevant in the 2024 race.\n\n\"Though not impossible in Kennedy's case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements,\" CNN wrote in a memo over the weekend outlining logistics around opening statements and commercial breaks.\n\nCNN has not budged on their conditions. Candidates must still clear at least 15 percent of support in four polls and be viable on enough state ballots to earn 270 delegates to participate in the forum with moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nNoting the time constraints, the cable news network has all but counted out a last-minute appearance from Kennedy, who has alleged without evidence that the candidates and journalists have manipulated the rules against him.\n\nThe 70-year-old environmental lawyer has had a bumpy path to ballot access, which will likely be the key factor that prevents him from meeting the deadline. The state-centric process has not been explored much during recent cycles because candidates registered with the two major parties don't need to petition to get on ballots.\n\nBut as an independent, Kennedy's path to the general election has meant learning individual state laws and nuances needed to secure ballots -- and under intense deadlines. The debate has put additional time pressure on the process, making it nearly impossible for him to hit 270 delegates at this point.\n\nSecretaries of state have the flexibility to decide when to count and certify candidates' materials. While Kennedy claims to have made enough state ballots to clinch enough electoral votes to win in November -- his campaign website shows 310 potential electoral votes -- most states where he says he has gotten access won't confirm his claims until later in the race.\n\nBallot experts say officials often prioritize accuracy over speed and aren't up against the same time constraints as candidates.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's doing anything to handicap him,\" said Scott Tranter, an analyst and adviser to Decision Desk HQ, which tracks Kennedy's 2024 ballot access with The Hill. \"I think they're just trying to do everything by the book.\"\n\nNetworks in charge of producing debates are also able to use their discretion over what they believe is fair to ask of candidates to be able to compete in front of televised audiences.\n\n\"They decide their own rules,\" Tranter said about CNN, who released its criteria in mid-May. \"It is their determination who qualifies or not; it is their determination what the rules are today and whether those are the same rules tomorrow.\"\n\nA pro-Biden source in Democratic circles offered a blunter prediction for Kennedy's chances of meeting the deadline in less than 24 hours: \"He's not making the stage,\" the source said.\n\nThe antiestablishment candidate's all-but-certain miss of the first showing isn't great optics for him, and some Democrats say it's indicative of a broader issue he faces with fundraising and public perception.\n\n\"It plays into a larger pattern re: visibility,\" said the Democratic source helping to reelect the incumbent president.\n\nWhile the ballot access is the most obvious barrier, the fact that Kennedy hasn't been able to clear the polling prerequisite is also a possible sign of wavering support.\n\n\"Tanking poll numbers, cash blow, ballot access challenges -- he's going to have a hard time making a case for electability with all of this combined as people are finally tuning in,\" the Democratic source added.\n\nPolling isn't always clear on how Kennedy may alter the final outcome in the fall -- or even if he'll even get to that point. If he does go up against Trump and Biden in November, a DDHQ/The Hill polling analysis shows that he helps boost Trump at the national level. But when broken down into key battlegrounds like New Hampshire and Michigan, some polls show him giving Biden an edge.\n\nKennedy's campaign did not respond to a request for comment from The Hill about whether he still believes he has a pathway to debate or if he's planning counter-programming that night.\n\nFor now, campaign officials are pursuing a legal track. His campaign filed a lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission last month alleging that Kennedy was held to \"different criteria\" than his counterparts, which they contend is against the Federal Election Campaign Act. The status of the complaint is ongoing but could potentially be resolved by the next scheduled debate in September with ABC News.\n\nWith less than a full day to make the 12 a.m. deadline, however, Kennedy can only do so much. Some figures willing to entertain parts of his non-traditional candidacy say he should maximize being away from the stage as a way to show off his position as an outsider.\n\n\"I definitely think he should,\" said Cenk Uygur, a left-wing media personality who's met privately with Kennedy and recently hosted him on his program, The Young Turks.\n\n\"It's borderline cheating if they don't allow him into the debates when he has been in double digits. What else does someone have to do to qualify?\" Uygur said.\n\nUygur said he would be willing to offer up his own platform if Kennedy wanted to present an alternative show the same night. \"I'm open to airing anything along those lines,\" he said.\n\nOne Kennedy ally who recently advised him on a messaging issue added that he \"definitely should do something\" to make noise while Biden and Trump spar.\n\nTo others, the real test will come after the event wraps up, when candidates have a chance to prop up or potentially tweak the stories of their campaigns around what views saw in front of them.\n\n\"The debate expectations have less to do with the performances and more to do with the narratives before and after the debate,\" said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaigns.\n\nDemocratic observers are waiting to gauge Biden's sharpness and stamina, and whether Trump damages himself with an unrestrained performance, much like he did in the first debate against Biden in 2020. Trump sympathizers, meanwhile, are gearing up for a night against an incumbent they see as inherently weak.\n\nThat doesn't leave much bandwidth for Kennedy.\n\n\"Win or lose, I don't imagine any candidate seeing spikes in their approval ratings based on debate performances. It'll be the narratives they drive online, on the trail, or through their networks before and after the debate,\" Ceraso said.\n\nIf Kennedy, however, can turn his failure to qualify into a personal grievance, he might have a chance of resonating off stage. His best bet, some believe, is to win by losing.\n\n\"RFK is betting on this, and the only way he wins is if his supporters believe he was denied entry to the debate due to unfair rules or the system working against him and he doesn't perform,\" Ceraso added.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanna_trudo@wtaj.com", "name": "Hanna Trudo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The debate, hosted by CNN in Atlanta, marks the first time the pair have shared a stage since 2020.\n\nThe race between the pair remains tight with polling by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ Wednesday showing Trump had a 0.6% lead over Biden. The tight polling comes amid convictions for both Trump and Biden's son, Hunter Biden. Both convictions will likely be brought up in the debate.\n\nTrump was found guilty of 34 felony charges for falsifying business records last month. Recent polling found that although only a small share of Republicans said they would be less likely to back Trump after his conviction, 21% of independents said they were less likely to vote for him.\n\nHunter Biden was found guilty of all three felony gun charges earlier this month. He faces up to 25 years in prison. The majority of voters said they were largely unphased by the conviction, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and features a new set of rules to prevent some of the familiar animosity between Biden and Trump. Here's everything you need to know about the first debate:\n\nYou can watch the CNN Presidential Debate live on NewsNation on June 27. Join us for \"It's Debate Night with Chris Cuomo\" at 8p/7C for pre-debate analysis and join us after the debate for analysis. To find your channel, visit joinnn.com.\n\nThe CNN Presidential Debate will air at 9 p.m. ET on June 27. It will be 90 minutes long and include two commercial breaks.\n\nCNN has confirmed that the campaigns of Biden and Trump have agreed to rules that have never previously been used in a debate. Some of the rules include that there will be no audience, no help from aides, no notes and no interrupting.\n\nTo enforce the no interruptions rule, the microphone of one candidate will be muted while the other is speaking. The moderators \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" according to CNN.\n\nPrevious debates between the two candidates have been criticized for the chaos of the two men talking over each other, in one instance leading to Biden saying \"Will you shut up, man?\"\n\nThe only items available to them at their podiums will be paper, a pen and a bottle of water. The podium each man stands at will be determined by a coin flip. There will be no other props, such as earpieces. Neither candidate will be allowed to call on aides during the commercial breaks.\n\nSome Democratic strategists think that the new rules could potentially benefit Biden.\n\n\"I actually think this will benefit President Biden, giving him the opportunity to fully explain himself and fully get his comment off the mic without having the interruption of Donald Trump,\" strategist Krystal Knight told \"NewsNation Prime\"\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will likely not be participating in CNN's Presidential Debate. To qualify for the debate, a candidate must appear on the ballot in enough states to reach the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win the presidential election.\n\nKennedy's campaign claimed they have enough signatures for ballot access in states with over 270 electoral votes, but many states have not verified these signatures yet. Kennedy is currently only on the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral votes.\n\n\"They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy,\" Kennedy wrote on X.\n\nParticipants must also receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters according to CNN.\n\nKennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Biden and Trump \"colluded\" to keep him out of this debate, Politico reports. CNN said this claim is unfounded. '\n\nTopics such as the problems at the border, the economy and Trump's felony conviction are expected to be highlighted throughout the debate. Biden's campaign has attempted to keep the economy and infrastructure at the center of his campaign as Trump continues to poll ahead of Biden on border issues.\n\nVoters on both sides of the aisle have also voiced concerns over the health of both men, as they are the two oldest major-party candidates to ever seek presidential office. Trump turned 78 earlier this month and Biden is 81.\n\nBiden publicly challenged Trump to a debate in May, which Trump accepted, and two debates were scheduled before the end of the day. Both Biden's and Trump's campaigns have agreed to the rules set forth by CNN and accepted the invitation.\n\n\"The contrast between President Trump's strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden's weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week,\" Trump campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, wrote on X.\n\nBiden's debate preparations will be led by Ron Klain, his first White House Chief of Staff. Klain performed this same role in Biden's 2020 presidential debates and his 2012 vice-presidential debate.\n\nThe next presidential debate will take place on September 10, hosted by ABC.\n\nA vice presidential debate could take place on July 23 or August 13. The Biden campaign informed CBS News that it accepted the invitation to a debate on either of those dates, but Trump has not yet selected a running mate.", "source": {"uri": "newsnationnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsNation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cuomo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Cuomo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr.'s campaign says they \"will be on the ballot in Pennsylvania\" with the petition deadline looming.\n\nIn a statement to abc27, the Kennedy campaign said they are \"on track to have triple the required amount of signatures by the end of June.\"\n\nThird-party candidates have until August 1, 2024, to file petitions with 5,000 signatures in order to appear on Pennsylvania's general election ballot. Objections to those petitions can be filed until August 8.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign announced in early June that he'd qualified to appear on enough ballots to receive the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. The campaign said they'd submitted signatures for 19 states, however many of those remain unverified.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and prominent anti-vaccine activist, abandoned his Democratic primary challenge to Biden last year and began campaigning as an independent. Among the major obstacles he faces is an expensive and time-consuming requirement to secure ballot access state by state, which will require him to collect millions of signatures that must be verified by election officials before his candidacy is approved.\n\nHe's built a loyal following among people disaffected by American institutions including the government, corporations and the media, an ideologically eclectic group that will have an unpredictable impact on the election. Biden and Trump both fear that Kennedy will draw voters who might otherwise vote for them.\n\nKennedy could play spoiler in Pennsylvania, a state that helped swing the 2020 election toward Joe Biden.

Kennedy Jr. will not be joining President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on the debate stage next week, after failing to reach two of the required three criteria by the Thursday June 20 deadline.\n\nCNN posted the announcement shortly after midnight Thursday morning that Biden and Trump were heading for a \"historic showdown\" with the \"stage now set\" for their June 27 meeting.\n\n\"The showdown will make history as the first debate between a sitting president and a former president. It will also be the first debate since 2020 featuring either Biden, who did not face a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination, or Trump, who skipped those held during the Republican primary race,\" reported CNN.\n\nWith the \"debate qualification window\" closed at 12:00:01 a.m. ET, only Biden and Trump had satisfied CNN's constitutional, ballot qualification, and polling thresholds, established by the network in May.\n\nKennedy had met the constitutional criteria, being legally qualified to run for president and having filed a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission, but failed to meet the other two.\n\nThe polling threshold required a candidate to receive at least 15 percent support in four separate national qualified polls of registered or likely voters, and the ballot qualification criteria required a candidate to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots for it to be possible to achieve 270 Electoral College votes, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nAs The New York Times noted, Kennedy only had three of the four polls needed and fell even further short regarding his ballot qualification, achieving \"less than a third\" of the number he needed, \"officially on the ballot in only six states -- California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah -- totaling 89 Electoral College votes.\"\n\nThe June 27 debate in Atlanta will be hosted by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.\n\nPer debate rules agreed to by the Biden and Trump campaigns, there will be no studio audience and the candidates' microphones will be muted except when it is their turn to speak. No props or pre-written notes will be allowed on stage, and each candidate will be given a pen, a pad of note paper, and a bottle of water.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy, Jr. campaign in a statement claims that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) said CNN would violate federal law if it excluded Kennedy in the upcoming presidential debate on June 27.\n\nVerdict: Misleading\n\nAn FEC spokesperson told Check Your Fact that the commission has not issued a statement about the CNN debate. A CNN spokesperson refuted the claim, while an expert said CNN might have violated federal law.\n\nFact Check:\n\nKennedy has restated that he is against a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, according to The Hill. During an interview with Piers Morgan, Kennedy said Hamas needs to be \"disarmed\" and suggested Hamas members are in refugee camps.\n\nA press release from the Kennedy campaign claims the FEC made a statement saying CNN's exclusion of Kennedy in the upcoming debate would be a violation of federal law.\n\n\"The Federal Election Commission's (FEC) recent public statement regarding CNN's presidential debate makes clear CNN will violate federal law absent the inclusion of Robert F. Kennedy Jr,\" it reads, in part.\n\nThis claim is misleading, however. The \"statement\" the press release hyperlinks to is actually an article from KITV, a television station in Hawaii. The FEC confirmed with the outlet that \"the designation given by CNN to Presidents Biden and Trump to appear exclusively in a June televised debate is not officially recognized.\" The FEC also confirmed that the phrase \"presumptive nominee\" often used by CNN to refer to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump is not used by the FEC.\n\nThere is no mention that CNN will violate federal law if , as claimed by the Kennedy statement.\n\n\"The FEC has not issued any statement regarding the CNN debate,\" an FEC spokesperson told Check Your Fact in an email. The spokesperson also referenced guidelines from The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations on candidate debates, which state, in part, \"staging organization(s) must use pre-established objective criteria to determine which candidates may participate in a debate.\" A summary article from the FEC was also referenced. (RELATED: Did RFK Jr. Meet With Then-President Trump To Lead A Vaccine Safety Commission)\n\nThe statement claims CNN violated the Federal Election Campaign Act by not using \"'pre-established' and 'objective' criteria to determine candidate participation.\" A CNN spokesperson pushed back against the claim in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\n\"The law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK, Jr. currently does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\nCNN outlined its criteria in a May 15 press release. These requirements to qualify for the debate are:\n\n\"file a Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission; a candidate's name must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency prior to the eligibility deadline; agree to accept the rules and format of the debate; and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards for reporting.\"\n\nThe polling window closes seven days before the June 27 debate, the press release states. (RELATED: Did Robert Kennedy Jr. Win A Supreme Court Case Declaring Covid-19 Vaccines Were Not Vaccines?)\n\nDerek T. Muller, professor at Notre Dame Law School, told Check Your Fact via email that it appears that CNN is using different criteria for Trump and Biden when compared with Kennedy, but acknowledged that Kennedy may not meet polling criteria. He cited two articles from Election Law Blog.\n\n\"It certainly looks like CNN is using different criteria for Trump and Biden than for any other candidates. The criteria is supposed to be objective, but CNN appears to be modifying its criteria to apply to the Republican and Democratic presumptive nominees,\" Muller said. \"That in turn appears to violate federal campaign guidelines. Of course, Kennedy may not meet the polling criteria, in which case at least his eligibility to appear on stage would be moot as to this issue.\"\n\nKennedy Jr.'s campaign has filed a complaint with the FEC about the debate's criteria. As of publishing time, the FEC has not made a decision. A Kennedy campaign spokesperson directed Check Your Fact via email to a June 18 press release reporting that the FEC has said it will not dismiss the complaint.", "source": {"uri": "checkyourfact.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Check Your Fact"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

If I believed him, I would go through the torture of watching his joint television appearance next week with President Joe Biden.\n\nCNN bills the event it's broadcasting as a debate. That's like the guy who sweeps up after circus elephants saying he loves being an entertainer.\n\nSpin, insults and revisionist history don't make a debate. Nor will those tactics change minds in New Mexico, a state Trump lost in the last two presidential elections.\n\nFor Trump to take New Mexico this year, he would have to contain his xenophobia until November. And voters would have to develop amnesia regarding Trump's calls for the Central Park 5 to be executed. The Black teenagers turned out to be innocent, a status Trump tried to claim for himself after a jury convicted him of 34 felonies.\n\nNeither CNN's show nor a similar one in September will influence most voters. That got me to wondering whether the groundbreaking televised debates of 1960 between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy were more insightful or at least more interesting.\n\nI watched all four the other day, and I was impressed in spite of many flaws.\n\nKennedy and Nixon spent most of their time answering questions from other white men who worked for television networks. It was jarring to see only light-skinned males interrogating the candidates about segregation, fairness in employment and the possibility of a cold war turning hot.\n\nThat said, the Nixon-Kennedy discussions were far better than what passes for a modern presidential debate. Both candidates maintained a civil tongue. Part of it was they had been freshmen congressmen together and had gotten along. But each also knew rudeness or animus would hurt his cause.\n\nIn the first debate, Kennedy saved his harshest attack for the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. \"I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa in charge of the largest union in the United States still free,\" Kennedy said.\n\nAs a Democratic senator, Kennedy served on a committee that investigated corruption in labor unions. The committee's lawyer was Kennedy's younger brother, Robert, who despised Hoffa.\n\nAfter John Kennedy won the presidency, he appointed his brother as attorney general. Robert Kennedy formed what he and his staff called the Get Hoffa Squad. Its mission was to put the Teamsters' leader in a cell.\n\nHoffa, a Republican, eventually was convicted of a series of crimes and sentenced to 13 years in federal prison. Nixon later won the presidency, and he commuted Hoffa's sentence after less than five years served.\n\nIf a powerful labor leader could back a Republican in 1960, so could the first Black man hired by a Major League Baseball team in the 20th century. Jackie Robinson an immortal member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was put off by Kennedy.\n\nNixon \"was the most sincere as far as civil rights were concerned,\" Robinson said after receiving audiences with each candidate. In that era, Black people often supported Republicans, the party of Lincoln and of Jack Roosevelt Robinson's namesake, Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nKennedy in the first debate worked to knock down imagery that he was a wealthy Harvard man who didn't grasp the injustices of a segregated society.\n\n\"I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights,\" Kennedy said in his Boston brogue. \"If a Negro baby is born, and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities, he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. About half as much chance to own a house.\"\n\nKennedy scored points with liberals and with many in the political middle ground. An oddity was the strongest racist in any statehouse, Gov. John Patterson of Alabama, who said his man Kennedy won the debate.\n\nNixon, from an impoverished farming family in California, challenged Kennedy's commitment to civil rights, notably in their second debate. Nixon raised the idea of Kennedy paying more attention to the electoral map than to justice when Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson of Texas for the second spot on the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"Let's look at the performance,\" Nixon said. \"When [Kennedy] selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and opposes them at the present time.\"\n\nStill, rancor was absent from the debates. Nixon's assessment of Kennedy choosing Johnson was as close as anything came to a personal attack, and it was a fact-filled statement. As a congressman and a senator, Johnson had opposed desegregation bills. He would have a role reversal in his own presidency.\n\nKennedy, Nixon and Johnson -- all flawed, all accused or guilty of corruption -- weren't necessarily better men than today's candidates. But they weren't about to mock competitors or slap unfavorable nicknames on them.\n\nCandidates feared voters in 1960. They had good reason.\n\nSeventy million of the country's 110 million adults watched the first Kennedy-Nixon debate. If they didn't like what they heard from one candidate, they wouldn't hesitate. Unlike followers of convicted felon Trump, they would vote for the other guy.\n\nRingside Seat is an opinion column about people, politics and news.

Kennedy Jr. ought to do his own version of storming Atlanta.\n\nGen. William Tecumseh Sherman did it in 1864, but Kennedy's iteration would be peaceful. Still, he could capture the attention of the nation.\n\nIt wouldn't be the famous scorched-earth march to the sea, but Kennedy's maneuver would illustrate how he is being screwed.\n\nAtlanta is the site of the first of two presidential debates between Democratic President Joe Biden, 81, and Republican challenger former President Donald Trump, 78. Kennedy, 70, is not invited.\n\nSponsored by CNN, the one-on- one debate will take place June 27.\n\nCNN says Kennedy, a third-party candidate, failed to make the cut. Others believe that CNN, as well as Biden and Trump, simply did not want Kennedy around.\n\nThree makes a crowd, you see. The debaters themselves pose additional challenges. Kennedy suffers from what is known as spasmodic dysphonia, an ailment that affects the voice box.\n\nIt is bad enough that voters can barely make out what Biden is mumbling about in his strangulation of the English language. but viewers would also have to listen to Kennedy's rasping presentation. Trump is no great orator either.\n\nIt might be helpful if CNN provides English-language interpreters for all three of them.\n\nWhere is a soaring JFK when you need one?\n\nCNN said that to qualify Kennedy would have to appear on the ballots of enough states to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the election. So far, he apparently has not done so -- at least not yet.\n\nKennedy said that CNN deliberately adopted rules to keep him off the stage, but that he will still try to qualify, taking his effort down to the wire.\n\nKennedy on the debate stage could act a as a buffer -- or a referee -- between Biden and Trump. At the very least he would bring some energy to the debate which appears designed to take all the drama out of the event and protect Biden.\n\nThe debate will last for 90 minutes if Biden can stay awake that long. There will be no live audience. There will be no interaction between the candidates because their microphones will be muted except when it is time for them to speak.\n\nThere are no rules for sign language, however.\n\nClearly the two do not like each other. Trump calls Biden the worst president in history, and Biden calls -- or used to call -- Trump a convicted felon. Now, since Hunter Biden's felony gun conviction, he just calls Trump a dictator.\n\nCNN said the moderators -- Democratic Party sympathizers Jake Tapper and Dana Bash -- \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.\"\n\nIf current rhetoric between Trump and Biden is any indication, a civilized discussion between the pair will be something to behold.\n\nThe debate will open with each candidate standing at a lectern instead of walking on stage so that Biden will not be viewed shuffling, staggering or wandering around. Barack Obama will not be around to guide him on or off the stage as he did at the Los Angeles fundraiser the other night.\n\nEach will also be given a pen, a notepad and a bottle of water, but will not allowed to stab each other or throw water or the bottle at one another during the two breaks for commercials. Nor can they use the pen and paper to send nasty messages or hurl spitballs at each other.\n\nThere will be no opening statements, but each candidate will be allowed two minutes for closing remarks.\n\nWhen asked a question, each candidate will have two minutes to respond, which will be followed by a one-minute rebuttal. If a candidate goes over his time, a red light will flash on.\n\nWill Biden attempt to channel JFK and his famous \"Ask Not\" speech n his closing remarks? Biden's version would have to be: \"Ask not what you can do for your country, but what you can do for me.\"\n\nNo joke.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_lucas@bostonherald.com", "name": "Peter Lucas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. and Jill Stein of the Green Party failed to qualify. Stein was never close to qualifying and Kennedy fell short of qualifying by the deadline, CNN said.\n\nKennedy needed 15% support in four approved national polls; he had three. Second, he needed to be on the ballot in enough states to win 270 votes in the Electoral College; he's on enough to reach 40 electoral votes, according to Decision Desk HQ. New York Times analysis has him at 89, still well short of the qualifying number.\n\nKennedy is beseeching the Federal Election Commission to intervene and not allow the debate, stating that CNN's qualification rules for him were made \"illegally.\" Further, he asserts that CNN colluded with the Trump and Biden campaigns to keep him out of the debate, an allegation Stein agrees with.\n\n\"I certainly agree with RFK that there was illegal collusion here between the two candidates and CNN. This is basically illegally political coordination and we too, have now just filed a complaint with the FEC as well,\" Stein told Scripps News on Wednesday.\n\n\"Well, it is illegal for a TV station to be in private dialogue with the political campaigns in order to create criteria that will keep all other competitors out. That is very much against FEC rules and also constitutes an illegal campaign contribution.\"\n\nAs it stands, however, it's Biden vs. Trump in next Thursday's first presidential debate of the season. The 90-minute affair will be held without a studio audience, hosted by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta.\n\n\"I think 'Fake' Tapper would really help himself if it were honest. But you'll see immediately if it is or not. ... Dana Bash is the other,\" Trump said at a Tuesday rally. \"I'll probably be negotiating with three people, but that's OK, I've done that before.

Kennedy Jr. managed to satisfy two of the prerequisites for a run at the Oval Office: being born in the United States, and filing an official statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nHowever, the longtime anti-vaxxer and brainworm survivor failed to clear the bar on two other requirements, namely, reaching a threshold of at least 15 percent in four major national polls of registered or likely voters, and getting himself on the ballot in enough states to have a viable shot at clinching the necessary 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the election in November.\n\nKennedy fell short on both counts, garnering the minimum level of support in just three approved polls -- CNN, Quinnipiac University, and Marquette Law -- and appearing on the ballot in a mere nine states, which account for a total 139 electoral votes.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President and newly convicted felon Donald Trump, were the only candidates to qualify, according to CNN, which is hosting next week's debate.\n\nKennedy, 70, has also struggled mightily in his fundraising efforts, with the campaign \"on financial life support\" as of a week ago, Politico reported.\n\n\"Kennedy has tried myriad gimmicks to bring in donations: Months of hawking $10 raffle tickets -- Whale watching! The thrill of Falconry! Luxury sunset sailing adventure! -- have only resulted in anemic small-dollar donation totals,\" according to the outlet. \"The campaign has tried to attract larger donations by running online auctions for Kennedy paraphernalia and exclusive perks, but those efforts have never once hit their monthly fundraising goals. The campaign just launched a new play: Paying supporters 15 percent of any funds they help raise.\"\n\nStill, it was not nearly enough to get Kennedy over the finish line. His candidacy has largely been funded by Trump megadonor Tim Mellon. And if controversial running mate Nicole Shanahan hadn't herself recently pumped some $15 million into the campaign's coffers, the entire operation would be insolvent, according to Politico.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign reported having a paltry $6.4 million in cash on hand at the end of May.\n\nKennedy could potentially qualify for the second debate, which will be hosted by ABC News and is scheduled for September 10, according to NBC News.\n\nAll told, Kennedy's chances of a victory in November are \"essentially nil,\" YouGov reported earlier this month, and his net favorability ratings plummeted 25 points between January and June, from +12 to -13.\n\n\"Over the past several months, his support has increased from 2 percent of registered voters to 4 percent, but this rise is within the margin of error and far outside the level of a contender,\" according to YouGov.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

(Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty Images)\n\nLINCOLN -- Third-party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose bid has spurred the ire of the current president as well as the previous president, turned in enough signatures this week in Nebraska that his name will likely reach the November ballot.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign announced that it had turned in more than 5,000 signatures to the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office. The state's chief election office now must check the voter registration file to verify at least 2,500 valid ones.\n\nLane Koch, the Kennedy campaign's regional director in the Midwest, thanked volunteers for \"a historic day.\" In addition to Nebraska, the Kennedy campaign said it has turned in signatures in 14 other states, including neighboring Iowa.\n\nKennedy is already on the ballot in at least nine states: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. His campaign says it is still working to get him on the ballot in all 50.\n\nMost political observers give Kennedy little chance to beat either President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, or former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, in Nebraska or nationally.\n\nHowever, some consider Kennedy a potential spoiler in swing districts where a percentage point or three could alter a state's Electoral College votes. Among those is Nebraska's Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.\n\nNebraska and Maine are the only two states that split off electoral votes for president for the winners in each congressional district. Nebraska's 2nd District backed Biden in 2020 and former President Barack Obama in 2008, sending each a single electoral vote.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) won't make the requirements set forth to qualify for the first presidential debate on June 27th.\n\nThe independent candidate is determined to debate his Democratic and Republican rivals in Atlanta on June 27. But he's running out of time to make the polling and delegate benchmarks that Biden and Trump have already surpassed before Thursday's midnight deadline.\n\nFailing to meet the eligibility criteria would be the first big blow for the third-party candidate struggling to remain relevant in the 2024 race.\n\n\"Though not impossible in Kennedy's case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements,\" CNN wrote in a memo over the weekend outlining logistics around opening statements and commercial breaks.\n\nThis would be a blow to Kennedy's rather quixotic campaign.\n\nPresidential debates have always had the capability of being a game-changer, even though it doesn't always work out that way. Two times where it did, though, are within living memory, and both were during Ronald Reagan's two presidential campaigns; the first, during the debate with President Jimmy Carter, Reagan seized control of the conversation when he turned to Carter and said, \"See, there you go again,\" and proceeded to deconstruct the president's argument. The second was the famous display of Reagan's vaunted sense of humor when in the 1984 campaign, a Baltimore Sun correspondent asked him about being the oldest president in U.S. history. Reagan's response was classic, and in that moment, when even Walter Mondale burst out laughing at Reagan's reply, he cinched his historic 49-state landslide re-election.\n\nGoing on to quote Cicero (or Seneca) was just the icing on the cake.\n\nGranted, there are not always such moments on these debate stages. But there is the potential for them, and if a candidate does not appear, there is no chance at all.\n\nThe conditions candidates are required to make the debate aren't easy for an independent:\n\nCNN has not budged on their conditions. Candidates must still clear at least 15 percent of support in four polls and be viable on enough state ballots to earn 270 delegates to participate in the forum with moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nAll candidates must meet the same conditions.\n\nSee Related: RFK Jr.'s Reaction to Trump Conviction? 'You Can't Save Democracy by Destroying It First'\n\nLet the Games Begin: Rules Are Set for CNN's Upcoming Trump-Biden Debate\n\nOne Kennedy supporter spoke out on what alternatives are open to the candidate if the debate doesn't include him.\n\nWith less than a full day to make the 12 a.m. deadline, however, Kennedy can only do so much. Some figures willing to entertain parts of his nontraditional candidacy say he should maximize being away from the stage as a way to show off his position as an outsider.\n\n\"I definitely think he should,\" said Cenk Uygur, a left-wing media personality who's met privately with Kennedy and recently hosted him on his program, \"The Young Turks.\"\n\n\"It's borderline cheating if they don't allow him into the debates when he has been in double digits. What else does someone have to do to qualify?\" Uygur said.\n\nIt is not, of course, cheating, borderline, or anything else, so long as all candidates are required to meet the same criteria. The debate organizers do have something of a tightrope to walk, after all; the criteria cannot be so strict that one or both of the major-party candidates are excluded (much as some in the legacy media might like that), nor can they be so loose as to allow every gag candidate, huckster, bindlestiff and gandy dancer onto the stage.\n\nRFK Jr. making the debate stage at this point looks unlikely in the extreme, and that may well spell the end of his campaign, even if he does continue his efforts on to election day.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

The state's chief election office now must check the voter registration file to verify at least 2,500 valid ones.\n\nLane Koch, the Kennedy campaign's regional director in the Midwest, thanked volunteers for \"a historic day.\" In addition to Nebraska, the Kennedy campaign said it has turned in signatures in 14 other states, including neighboring Iowa.\n\nKennedy is already on the ballot in at least nine states: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.

That figure is more than twice the 2,500 signatures required for independent presidential candidates to appear on Nebraska's general election ballot.\n\nEvnen's office hasn't yet reviewed the signatures Kennedy's campaign turned in, at least 2,500 of which must be valid signatures from registered voters in Nebraska for Kennedy to qualify for the ballot.

Kennedy and the son of his slain brother, brought his unorthodox presidential campaign to Lincoln in December, drawing a crowd of several hundred Nebraskans and political tourists as he billed his bid for the presidency as one meant to take the United States back \"from the people who stole it.\"\n\nAt his Lincoln rally, Kennedy warned of issues as mainstream as inflation and as fringe as \"cellphone radiation\" while promising not to fight the culture wars that, he said, have bogged down national politics of late by ensuring the country's residents are angry at one another.\n\nBut he has repeatedly made unfounded claims about COVID-19 and vaccines. In Lincoln, he lamented the pandemic-era shutdown of private businesses \"with no scientific citation.\"\n\nWhen he launched his presidential campaign in April 2023, Kennedy intended to challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHe changed course in October, launching an independent bid for the White House that initially drew the ire of the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nKennedy, who holds better favorability ratings among Republicans than Democrats, has said that his intention is to \"spoil\" the election for both Trump and Biden.\n\nIf he does gain ballot access in Nebraska, Kennedy would be the first presidential candidate to reach the state's ballot via a petition since Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in 2016.\n\nThe Green Party is not a recognized party in Nebraska, but Stein submitted 5,388 valid signatures to reach the ballot independently.\n\nHer campaign had submitted another 2,445 signatures that were rejected as invalid, most of them because the signators were not registered voters in Nebraska or in the county on their petition sheet.\n\nRandall A.

He garnered fewer than 3,000 votes statewide.\n\nConsumer activist Ralph Nader qualified for the state's crowded 2008 ballot by petition. One of six candidates on Nebraska's presidential ballot that year, Nader won 5,406 votes -- good enough for a distant third-place finish behind John McCain and Barack Obama.\n\nNader also qualified for Nebraska's ballot by petition in 2004, along with the Socialist Workers Party's Roger Calero, who won 82 votes statewide en route to a last-place finish in Nebraska that year.\n\nNader, too, appeared on Nebraska's ballot in 2000 as the nominee for the Green Party, which was a recognized political party in the state at the time.\n\nTwo other candidates -- Pat Buchanan and Howard Phillips -- qualified by petition that year.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. turns in signatures to appear on Nebraska ballot, campaign says", "body": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s longshot presidential campaign submitted enough signatures to Nebraska's Secretary of State's Office on Tuesday to crack the state's November ballot, his campaign announced.\n\nKennedy's campaign turned in 5,023 signatures to Bob Evnen's office Tuesday, his campaign said in a news release. That figure is more than twice the 2,500 signatures required for independent presidential candidates to appear on Nebraska's general election ballot.\n\nEvnen's office hasn't yet reviewed the signatures Kennedy's campaign turned in, at least 2,500 of which must be valid signatures from registered voters in Nebraska for Kennedy to qualify for the ballot. Unlike ballot initiatives, candidates don't need signatures to be gathered from across the state.\n\nKennedy, 70, has gained ballot access in Utah, Michigan, California, Delaware, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Texas, South Carolina and Mississippi.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIowa DCI: Wall Lake trucker David Schultz's death 'not a homicide' Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Former Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Man dies in standoff with authorities in Sac County Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Athlete of the Week: Miller's motor leading the way for West Monona Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Sioux City man pleads not guilty of manslaughter Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Boat speed rule imposed on Okoboji lakes in wake of heavy rains, storms that also led to wastewater discharges Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Top area softball performers: RSM last unbeaten team; Mentzer, Moreau swinging hot bats\n\nHe has collected enough signatures to reach the ballot in 14 other states, including Nebraska, but hasn't officially been placed on the ballot in those states, his campaign said.\n\nKennedy, who is the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and the son of his slain brother, brought his unorthodox presidential campaign to Lincoln in December, drawing a crowd of several hundred Nebraskans and political tourists as he billed his bid for the presidency as one meant to take the United States back \"from the people who stole it.\"\n\nAt his Lincoln rally, Kennedy warned of issues as mainstream as inflation and as fringe as \"cellphone radiation\" while promising not to fight the culture wars that, he said, have bogged down national politics of late by ensuring the country's residents are angry at one another.\n\nBut he has repeatedly made unfounded claims about COVID-19 and vaccines. In Lincoln, he lamented the pandemic-era shutdown of private businesses \"with no scientific citation.\"\n\nWhen he launched his presidential campaign in April 2023, Kennedy intended to challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHe changed course in October, launching an independent bid for the White House that initially drew the ire of the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nKennedy, who holds better favorability ratings among Republicans than Democrats, has said that his intention is to \"spoil\" the election for both Trump and Biden.\n\nIf he does gain ballot access in Nebraska, Kennedy would be the first presidential candidate to reach the state's ballot via a petition since Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in 2016.\n\nThe Green Party is not a recognized party in Nebraska, but Stein submitted 5,388 valid signatures to reach the ballot independently.\n\nHer campaign had submitted another 2,445 signatures that were rejected as invalid, most of them because the signators were not registered voters in Nebraska or in the county on their petition sheet.\n\nRandall A. Terry cracked Nebraska's presidential ballot in 2012 by petition. He garnered fewer than 3,000 votes statewide.\n\nConsumer activist Ralph Nader qualified for the state's crowded 2008 ballot by petition. One of six candidates on Nebraska's presidential ballot that year, Nader won 5,406 votes -- good enough for a distant third-place finish behind John McCain and Barack Obama.\n\nNader also qualified for Nebraska's ballot by petition in 2004, along with the Socialist Workers Party's Roger Calero, who won 82 votes statewide en route to a last-place finish in Nebraska that year.\n\nNader, too, appeared on Nebraska's ballot in 2000 as the nominee for the Green Party, which was a recognized political party in the state at the time.\n\nTwo other candidates -- Pat Buchanan and Howard Phillips -- qualified by petition that year.\n\nPhotos: Presidential visits to Nebraska\n\nWilliam McKinley, 1898\n\nWilliam Howard Taft, 1909\n\nTeddy Roosevelt, 1910\n\nWoodrow Wilson, 1916\n\nFDR, 1935\n\nHarry S.

Harry Dunn, who rose to prominence as a Capitol Police officer who waged pitched battles with Trump's supporters during and after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, lost his Maryland House primary last month to Sarah Elfreth, a state senator who ran on her legislative record.\n\nMike O'Brien, a former Marine Corps officer and fighter pilot who made the preservation of democracy central to his candidacy, lost a Pennsylvania Democratic primary in April to a newscaster, Janelle Stelson, who used issues such as abortion access and the price of gasoline and groceries to win the right to challenge a fierce Trump Republican ally, Representative Scott Perry.\n\nIn 2018, the Vindman brothers, both lieutenant colonels in the Army and aides on the White House National Security Council at the time, raised internal alarms about a phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into the business dealings of Biden's son Hunter in his country.\n\nAt the time, Biden was widely expected to be Trump's opponent in the 2020 election. The call was central to the first of Trump's two impeachments, and it vaulted both Vindmans to prominence in liberal circles, though Alexander Vindman was the only brother who testified as part of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES\n\nFALLS CHURCH, Va. -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former president Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday.\n\nRepresentative Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Senator John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nBallots remained to be counted, and the close margin made the race too early to call. Virginia observes the Juneteenth holiday and wasn't expected to count votes Wednesday as a result. McGuire led Good by 327 votes, or 0.52 percentage points, out of 62,495 ballots counted as of 12 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly claimed that he appears on enough statewide ballots to qualify for next week's debate between President Biden and Donald Trump and has threatened to sue CNN for not letting him on the stage.\n\nBut a Washington Post survey of state election officials found Kennedy is not on the ballot in several states where he has claimed he is -- and he will not reach the requirement by Thursday's deadline to qualify for the debate. The rules of CNN's debate indicate candidates must appear on enough ballots nationwide to earn the requisite 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, along with earning 15 percent support in four national polls.\n\nElection officials in Utah, Delaware, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Tennessee have confirmed Kennedy will be on the ballot. Additionally, CNN has counted California and Hawaii, where Kennedy is the presumptive nominee of minor parties where the states have either not certified him or received paperwork. Those states add up to 100 electoral votes. Kennedy also has not yet met the polling requirement for the debate, though he could if a qualifying poll is released before Thursday.\n\nWASHINGTON POST\n\nWASHINGTON -- In the Senate, the term \"UC\" stands for \"unanimous consent\" -- usually verbal shorthand for an agreement by all senators to quickly take up and pass a bill. But with the November elections just months away, it might as well stand for: \"You see? Our political opponents are dead wrong on this issue.\"\n\nWith the focus of the political universe turning to the upcoming fight for control of Congress and the White House, lawmakers are spending most of their time not on real legislative work but trying to corner their rivals on hot-button issues.\n\nOn the Senate floor in recent days, those efforts have often taken the form of unanimous consent requests that are designed to fail, thus spotlighting one party or another's refusal to agree to a policy proposal.\n\nSuch procedural skirmishes provide a shortcut to Senate showdowns on wedge issues or subjects on which one party believes it has the upper hand. That was the case on Tuesday, when Democrats attempted to quickly bring up and pass a bill that would outlaw gun bump stocks after the Supreme Court last week struck down a ban on the devices.\n\nLike similar recent maneuvers, Democrats knew the UC attempt would fail because of a Republican objection, but they tried anyway in a bid to give themselves a talking point against the GOP.\n\n\"What today's bill does is return things to the status quo set by Donald Trump, saying bump stocks are dangerous and should be prohibited,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat and the majority leader, said on Tuesday. \"Senate Republicans by and large supported Donald Trump's ban on bump stocks back then, so they should support this bill today.\"\n\nThey didn't.\n\n\"I will stick with the court,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, who said he would prefer to align himself with the Supreme Court ruling than be steamrolled by Democrats. \"It's all political posturing for the election.\"\n\nThe outcome of the quick back and forth was a classic of the genre. In the bump stock case, the tussle was over the Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the ban on a device that allows semiautomatic weapons to fire more rapidly. The Trump administration imposed the ban after a 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert.\n\nLast week, the UC battlegrounds were Supreme Court ethics issues and in vitro fertilization. In coming weeks, there are likely to be more abortion-rights conflicts and other topics rising in the heated campaign environment.\n\nHere's how it works: A member of one party takes the floor to ask unanimous consent -- meaning the agreement of all 100 senators -- to immediately take up and pass this bill or that measure without debate, often since something has occurred to give it urgency.\n\nThe senator making the request lays out the case for the legislation even though it is extremely unlikely to speed through. A senator on the opposing side is allowed to lay out the opposition before ultimately objecting and blocking the effort in a chamber where it is nearly impossible to move expeditiously if anyone balks.\n\n\"Objection is heard,\" the presiding officer then declares. And that's that. Cue scores of news releases highlighting the effort -- and the move to block it.\n\nWhile it may seem like a waste of time and energy, the stagecraft allows the parties to show where the battle lines are drawn on a particular subject. Despite the limitations, some lawmakers embrace the strategy, particularly since votes on bills and amendments have declined in the Senate in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

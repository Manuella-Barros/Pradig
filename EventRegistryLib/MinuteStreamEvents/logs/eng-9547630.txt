Cannon did not immediately set a new date, but the delay increases the chance that the trial will not happen before the November election.\n\nReversing one of her own decisions, the federal judge overseeing former President Donald J. Trump's classified documents case granted his request on Monday to postpone the deadline for a crucial court filing in the criminal proceeding, increasing the chance that any trial would be pushed past the November election.\n\nThe ruling by the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, was made in a bare-bones order that contained no factual or legal reasoning. It did not schedule a new deadline but erased the one she had set almost a month ago ordering Mr. Trump's lawyers to file by Thursday a detailed list of the classified materials that they intend to introduce at the trial, which is set to take place at some point in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla.\n\nThat list is enormously consequential because, when filed, it will mark the first step in what will ultimately be a pitched battle between the defense and prosecution over what sorts of classified materials the jury will get to hear about at trial -- a contested process, balancing issues of public access and national security, that could take months to complete.\n\nMr. Trump has relentlessly pursued a strategy of delaying all four of the criminal cases he is facing, and if he succeeds in delaying his trial on charges of mishandling classified documents until after the election, he could order his Justice Department to drop the matter altogether if he wins.\n\nJudge Cannon's postponement of the filing deadline was merely the latest example of her acceding to Mr. Trump's attempts to delay the classified documents trial. Even though she held a hearing in Fort Pierce on March 1 specifically to change the current May 20 start of the trial, she has not yet selected a new date.\n\nAnd she has failed to make any decisions on several important motions, which has resulted in further delays.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pierce,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/06/us/politics/06dc-trump-documents/06dc-trump-documents-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 1780, "textEnd": 1787}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1823, "textEnd": 1829}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

before the court read more\n\nA Florida judge on Tuesday indefinitely postponed Donald Trump's criminal trial over his alleged mishandling of classified documents, making it unlikely the case will be heard before the November presidential election.\n\nThe former president had been scheduled to go on trial on May 20 but District Judge Aileen Cannon said that was not possible because of the number of pre-trial motions before the court.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, did not set a new date for the start of the federal trial.\n\nThe postponement is a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and makes it unlikely the case will be heard before the election now less than six months away, in which Trump is the Republican presumptive nominee for president.\n\nTrump's attorneys have sought to delay his various criminal cases until after the election, when the 77-year-old Trump could potentially have the federal charges against him dropped if he wins.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York on state charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty in Florida last June to the federal charges of unlawfully retaining national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.\n\nHe kept the classified files - which included records from the Pentagon, CIA and National Security Agency - unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and thwarted official efforts to retrieve them, according to the indictment.\n\nCannon, in her order, said the sheer number of pre-trial motions and the classified nature of some of the evidence in the case made it impossible to stick to the May trial date.\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024 trial date,\" she said.\n\nA new date would be \"reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with the Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice,\" Cannon said.\n\nIn addition to the New York and Florida cases, Trump has also been charged in Washington and Georgia with trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, his likely November opponent.", "source": {"uri":

This decision, revealed Monday, increases the risk that the trial will be pushed back past the November election.\n\nJudge Aileen M. Cannon's postponement of the filing deadline -- a list of the classified documents that the defense team would like to present at trial -- is another feather in Trump's cap, marking his latest successful attempt at delaying the classified documents trial. If he wins, Trump can then order his Justice department to drop the matter entirely, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump's lawyers were supposed to file their list by this Thursday, a deadline Cannon had set last month. The judge did not announce a new deadline, nor has she announced a trial start date. The trial had been slated to start May 20, but that date was scrapped at a March 1 hearing.\n\nWhen the list of defense documents is filed, it will be an integral part of the criminal trial, with lawyers for both sides arguing over what jurors would be allowed to hear at trial. This is \"a contested process, balancing issues of public access and national security, that could take months to complete,\" according to the Times.\n\nThe first time Trump's team asked for a delay of the Thursday deadline was about a month ago, when they sought to have it pushed to June. At the time, they argued that they were too busy defending the former president in one of the other four criminal cases against him: the Manhattan hush money trial.\n\nBut on Monday the defense pointed to a different reason, arguing that special counsel Jack Smith's office hadn't properly secured the classified files that they seized them from Trump's private club and residence in Mar-a-Lago and that they needed more time to assess that revelation. Smith in a filing last week had noted that some of the files were not in their original order, possibly due to an earlier review by a so-called special master that had been sought by the defense.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WBSOAXtXZHicdNvcArsBrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/salon_articles_879/1ade3cb7c7213440ee0f2faecead0788", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 919, "textEnd": 925}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 966}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Cannon ruled Tuesday, increasing the chance that the former president's ongoing New York criminal trial may be the only one to happen before the November election.\n\nThe judge had originally set the Florida trial date for late May, but that has seemed unlikely for months, with Cannon still needing to make decisions on a number of key legal issues before a jury can hear the case.\n\nAt a scheduling hearing in Florida on March 1, Trump's lawyers pushed to start the classified documents trial after the presidential election, in which he is the presumptive Republican nominee. Prosecutors urged Cannon to pick a date in early July.\n\nIf Trump returns to the Oval Office, he could appoint an attorney general who is willing to drop the federal charges against him; in addition, Justice Department policy forbids the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nIn her ruling Tuesday, Cannon said there are many complicated legal rules and deadlines surrounding the use of classified evidence in public criminal trials that need to be considered before she picks a new court date.\n\nThe order was a blow to special counsel Jack Smith and his team, who have argued that Trump's team have had ample time to prepare for a summer trial and accused Trump's lawyers of wrongly trying to use the three other criminal cases against him as a way to obfuscate and delay the legal proceedings in Florida.\n\nTrump's Manhattan trial for allegedly falsifying business records related to a hush money payment began in mid-April. His lead attorney in New York, Todd Blanche, is also his lead lawyer in Florida, and the legal team has told Cannon that Trump and Blanche are tied up with the ongoing trial and cannot prepare for the classified documents case.\n\nThey have also said that holding any trial too close to the election would amount to election interference, and that if Cannon cannot delay the classified documents case until after November, she should schedule it for August.\n\nCases that involve classified documents have to follow the rules and legal proceedings required under the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA, and generally move slower than standard cases. Cannon, a Trump nominee who has been on the bench since late 2020, is relatively inexperienced and has moved slowly on key decisions, according to some legal experts, holding hearings on even long-shot motions and posing unusual legal questions.\n\nIn her order Tuesday, Cannon rescheduled a number of pretrial deadlines that parties will have to meet. The latest deadline is a CIPA-related one and a scheduling conference July 22 - which means the trial cannot happen before then.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture-before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming-would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nTrump is the first former U.S. president to be charged with crimes. He faces four separate indictments as he campaigns for another term in the White House, an unprecedented test of the nation's legal and political systems. The timing of each case has grown increasingly consequential as he draws closer to a general election rematch against President Biden.\n\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to all 88 counts he faces. His D.C. federal trial for alleged obstruction of the 2020 election results is on hold while the Supreme Court considers his immunity claim, and his Georgia state trial for alleged election interference was stalled over accusations of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nIn Florida, Trump is charged with dozens of counts of mishandling classified information after his presidency ended and plotting with two aides to obstruct government efforts to recover the material from Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach home and private club in Florida. Prosecutors have accused Trump of taking hundreds of classified documents with him when he left the White House. The Washington Post has previously reported that some of the material was related to nuclear secrets, Iran's missile program and U.S. intelligence efforts in China.\n\nOn individual rulings, Cannon has so far generally sided with the government. She rejected two of Trump's motions to dismiss the case and ruled for prosecutors on key CIPA-related decisions that could have changed the contours and direction of the legal proceedings.\n\nBut when it comes to timing, her decisions have hobbled prosecutors' efforts to move forward quickly. They want the trial to occur before the election but have not explicitly argued that the November election is an event they are considering.\n\nCannon has still not ruled on a handful of Trump's motions. On Tuesday, she scheduled multiple new hearings on his requests, including one on June 21 for Trump's argument that Smith was unlawfully appointed and that the case against him should be dropped.\n\nCannon wrote in her order that her timetable is \"consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nThe next hearing on Cannon's new schedule is on grand jury matters set for Wednesday that will not be open to the public.\n\nAs part of her order, Cannon also pushed back a key CIPA-related deadline from May 9 to June 17. Blanche had asked her to move it back until three weeks after the conclusion of Trump's criminal trial in New York, so he and Trump could spend days in a secure facility in Florida, known as a SCIF, to review the relevant classified materials.\n\nSmith countered that Trump's legal team has known they would need to complete these motions and could have found time to do so.\n\n\"Trump elected to engage the same counsel of record in multiple serious criminal matters, and his counsel agreed to the multiple engagements,\" Smith wrote in his filing. \"Having made such decisions, they should not be allowed to use their overlapping engagements to perpetually delay trial in this case.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors":

Cannon ruled Tuesday, increasing the chance that Trump's New York criminal trial may be the only one to happen before the November election.\n\nThe judge had originally set the trial date for late May and heard arguments on March 1 about when the trial should be - with Trump's lawyers pushing to start after the presidential election, in which he is the presumptive Republican nominee, or no earlier than August.\n\nProsecutors urged Cannon to pick a date in early July.\n\nBut in her ruling, the judge said there are too many complicated legal rules and deadlines surrounding the use of classified evidence in public criminal trials that need to be considered before she finalizes a court date. She said she would schedule the trial date at a future time.\n\nCases that involve classified documents have to follow the rules and legal proceedings defined under the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA.\n\nIn her order Tuesday, Cannon set a number of new pre-trial deadlines that parties will have to meet. The latest deadline is a CIPA-related deadline for July 22 - which means the trial will not happen before then.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture-before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming-would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nTrump is the first former U.S. president to be charged with crimes. He faces four separate indictments as he campaigns for another term in the White House, an unprecedented test of the nation's legal and political systems. The timing of each case - including a state trial in New York that began April 15 - has grown increasingly consequential as he draws closer to a general election rematch against President Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\nHis D.C. federal trial for allegedly trying to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election victory is on hold while the Supreme Court weighs his claim that he is immune from prosecutions for actions he took as president. There is no trial date set yet in Georgia, where Trump is charged with a broad conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in that state.\n\nIn Florida, Trump is charged with dozens of counts of mishandling classified information after his presidency ended and plotting with two aides to obstruct government efforts to recover the material from Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach home and private club. He has filed multiple motions seeking to dismiss the charges on a variety of claims.\n\nProsecutors have accused Trump of taking hundreds of classified documents with him when he left the White House. The Washington Post has previously reported that some of the material was related to nuclear secrets, Iran's missile program and U.S. intelligence efforts in China.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com",

indefinitely postponed the former US President's criminal trial over his alleged mishandling of highly classified documents, making it unlikely the case will be heard before the November presidential election.\n\nThe former president had been scheduled to go on trial on May 20 but District Judge Aileen Cannon said that was not possible because of the number of pre-trial motions before the court.\n\nJudge Cannon, a Trump appointee, did not set a new date for the start of the federal trial.\n\nThe postponement is a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Mr Trump, and makes it unlikely the case will be heard before the election now less than six months away, in which Mr Trump is the Republican presumptive nominee for president.\n\nMr Trump's lawyers have sought to delay his various criminal cases until after the election, when the 77-year-old could potentially have the federal charges against him dropped if he wins.\n\nMr Trump is currently on trial in New York on state charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump pleaded not guilty in Florida last June to the federal charges of unlawfully retaining national defence information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.\n\nHe kept the classified files - which included records from the Pentagon, CIA and National Security Agency - unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home in West Palm Beach, Florida, and thwarted official efforts to retrieve them, according to the indictment.\n\nJudge Cannon, in her order, said the sheer number of pre-trial motions and the classified nature of some of the evidence in the case made it impossible to stick to the May trial date.\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024 trial date,\" she said.\n\nA new date would be \"reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with the Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice,\" Judge Cannon said.\n\nIn addition to the New York and Florida

She stated:\n\n[F]inalization of a trial date at this juncture - before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming - would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations as necessary to present this case to a jury.\n\nThe ruling established a second set of pre-trial deadlines, pushing back key dates for the court to manage pending discovery matters and adjudicate pre-trial motions. Cannon stated, \"[T]he Court finds that the ends of justice served by this continuance, through the last deadline specified in this Order, July 22, 2024, outweigh the best interest of the public and Defendants in a speedy trial.\"\n\nThe former president is charged with mishandling classified national security documents after leaving the White House and withholding the documents from federal authorities. The timing of the case has come under close watch as the November 5 presidential election nears and the other three pending cases against Trump continue through litigation. Trump's attorneys previously urged Cannon to set the Florida trial date to after the election since Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee to face current president Joe Biden. His team also claimed that the prosecution's case is \"politically motivated\" and that the trial could lead to election interference if it is held too close to Election Day.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, however, has denied claims of political motivation and argued that Trump's team has used the other pending cases to delay the Florida trial. Smith stated that Trump chose to use the same counsel in various criminal proceedings, and therefore Trump and his lawyers \"should not be allowed to use their overlapping engagements to perpetually delay trial in the case.\"\n\nIn the four separate cases, there are a total of 88 criminal counts against Trump. He pleaded not guilty to all of them. In Manhattan, he is charged with falsifying business records related to a 2016 hush money payment. That trial began last month, with the appeals court denying an effort to delay the case. Trump is also being charged with election interference in Georgia, though that court has not set a trial date yet. He is facing charges in a federal district court in Washington, D.C. for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss as well, but that case is on hold until the Supreme Court rules on his claims of absolute immunity.\n\nCannon's ruling to delay the Florida case decreases the likelihood that Trump will face trial there before the November 5 election. A sealed hearing regarding grand jury matters is scheduled for today, May 8.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri":

November presidential election.\n\nThe former president had been scheduled to go on trial on May 20 but District Judge Aileen Cannon said that was not possible because of the number of pre-trial motions before the court.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, did not set a new date for the start of the federal trial.\n\nThe postponement is a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and makes it unlikely the case will be heard before the election now less than six months away, in which Trump is the Republican presumptive nominee for president.\n\nTrump's attorneys have sought to delay his various criminal cases until after the election, when the 77-year-old Trump could potentially have the federal charges against him dropped if he wins.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York on state charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty in Florida last June to the federal charges of unlawfully retaining national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.\n\nHe kept the classified files -- which included records from the Pentagon, CIA and National Security Agency -- unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and thwarted official efforts to retrieve them, according to the indictment.\n\nCannon, in her order, said the sheer number of pre-trial motions and the classified nature of some of the evidence in the case made it impossible to stick to the May trial date.\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024 trial date,\" she said.\n\nA new date would be \"reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with the Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice,\" Cannon said.\n\nIn addition to the New York and Florida cases, Trump has also been charged in Washington and Georgia with trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, his likely November opponent.", "source": {"uri":

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing U.S. government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nHe has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Also accused of obstructing the FBI's efforts to get the papers back, Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe prosecution and defence had both acknowledged that the May date trial would probably need to be delayed, given still-unresolved issues in the case and because Trump is currently on trial in New York in connection with alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. The New York case involves several of the same lawyers who are representing Trump in the Florida case.\n\nJudge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, scheduled pre-trial hearings to take place until July 22.\n\nShe said it would be \"imprudent\" to set a new trial date given the uncertainties.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, who brought case, has proposed proceedings begin in July.\n\nTrump's lawyers have said it should not start until after the November 5 election, although suggested an August 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\nThe other two cases relate to his alleged attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 election - he has already been charged in a Georgia state court over the allegations while the Supreme Court is weighing Trump's arguments that he is immune from federal prosecution in a separate case brought by Smith.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases.\n\n\"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nCannon has denied two attempts by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType":

Tuesday indefinitely postponed Donald Trump's criminal trial over his alleged mishandling of classified documents, making it unlikely the case will be heard before the November presidential

court.\n\nJudge Cannon, a Trump appointee, did not set a new date for the start of the federal trial.\n\nThe postponement is a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Mr Trump, and makes it unlikely the case will be heard before the election now less than six months away, in which Mr Trump is the Republican presumptive nominee for president.\n\nMr Trump's attorneys have sought to delay his various criminal cases until after the election, when the 77-year-old Mr Trump could potentially have the federal charges against him dropped if he wins.\n\nDonald Trump is currently on trial in New York on state charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump pleaded not guilty in Florida last June to the federal charges of unlawfully retaining national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.\n\nHe kept the classified files - which included records from the Pentagon, CIA and National Security Agency - unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and thwarted official efforts to retrieve them, according to the indictment.\n\nJudge Cannon, in her order, said the sheer number of pre-trial motions and the classified nature of some of the evidence in the case made it impossible to stick to the May trial date.\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024 trial date,\" she said.\n\nA new date would be \"reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with the

Prosecutors meanwhile have pushed for it to take place this year.But the 20 May date set by Judge Cannon appeared less and less likely to hold amid slow-moving deliberations over multiple pre-trial issues.The former president is accused of keeping top-secret documents in his possession after leaving office, rather than returning them to the National Archives as prescribed by law.How Trump, Biden and Clinton cases compareGovernment prosecutors have also alleged that he then obstructed efforts to take back the documents, including by plotting to erase security video at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the 40 felony counts against him, which range from conspiracy to obstruct justice to making false statements.Also charged alongside him are his personal aide Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, a property manager at Mar-a-Lago. Both men have also pleaded not guilty. Getty ImagesDefence lawyers and prosecutors have repeatedly tussled in court over what classified evidence can be presented at trial, prompting a series of delays.Some legal commentators have also suggested that Judge Cannon, who has often sided with Mr Trump's arguments, is deliberately slow-walking the case on behalf of the man who appointed her to the court.In her Tuesday filing, the judge scheduled additional hearings over pending concerns, including one in late July, and declined to set a new date for the trial to begin.Finalising a trial date at this juncture, she wrote, \"would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court\".\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court,\" she added.Carl Tobias, a law expert at the University of Richmond, said that Judge Cannon had failed to act to limit the \"delay tactics\" of Mr Trump's team. \"Some complications and delays may have been inevitable... but the judge's failure to take control and move the case, or to request help is surprising,\" he said.Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is facing dozens of charges across three other criminal cases and is currently on trial in New York.But he is also awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on his claims of presidential immunity, a decision he has argued could influence all the criminal cases against him.Related TopicsIndictments of Donald TrumpDonald TrumpUnited States ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Archives and Records Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Richmond", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Richmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 497, "textEnd": 507}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 730, "textEnd": 736}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 2364, "textEnd": 2370}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signalled support for Trump's defence on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognise that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specialises in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signalled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AsiaOne"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@deccanherald.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White-collar crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-05%2F476ab7be-2eec-4123-a1c4-4e364b2ee79e%2F2024newsmlRC2PL7AXGJM21219453979.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C3500%2C1838&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 367, "textEnd": 373}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 477, "textEnd": 483, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-22", "textStart": 852, "textEnd": 859}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-12", "textStart": 1984, "textEnd": 1991}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Last year, Trump was indicted four separate times in cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C.\n\nCannon wrote that the \"finalization of a trial date at this juncture\" would be \"imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nThe trial in the case was scheduled to start on May 20. Trump's trial in the New York hush money case is likely to still be ongoing at that time, but Cannon also had indicated that a host of issues also had to be resolved, including those having to do with the use of classified documents in a public proceeding.\n\nTrump faces 40 felony charges related to his retention of classified documents after he left the White House. He has plead not guilty.\n\nTrump also faces a trial on charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election and remain in power. But that case also does not have a trial date, as the Supreme Court considers whether Trump had presidential immunity from prosecution on any of the charges. The court heard oral arguments last month.\n\nAlso in doubt is when a trial will start in Georgia, where Trump and a host of other defendants face racketeering and other charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ted_johnson@deadline.com", "name": "Ted Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151166340_d21109.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1002, "textEnd": 1008}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The trial start date was originally scheduled for May 20.\n\nCannon wrote that the \"finalization of a trial date at this juncture ... would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nThe delay comes amid an ongoing dispute between Trump's legal team, his co-defendants and special counsel Jack Smith over the placement of classified records in evidence. Trump's attorneys have claimed in recent days that the markers for the classified records he is accused of mishandling were not properly placed in evidentiary boxes.\n\nThe special counsel last week noted the discrepancy and has in the past revealed the documents were examined by relevant intelligence community agencies. The defendants say the discrepancies raise questions about the probe.\n\nThe special counsel declined to comment.\n\nCannon's long-awaited scheduling order came more than two months after she heard arguments from legal teams representing Trump and special counsel Jack Smith. The former president's attorneys urged her to avoid taking the case to trial until after the upcoming 2024 presidential election, but they also conceded that if Cannon were to decide to move forward, August or September would be feasible. Prosecutors said they would be ready for trial in July.\n\n\"The one thing the parties can agree on is this case can be tried this summer,\" deputy special counsel Jay Bratt argued in court in March. Cannon referred to some of the pretrial deadlines proposed by the Justice Department as \"unrealistic\" and said she needs space in the case to \"allow for flexibility.\"\n\nIn the same hearing, Trump attorney Todd Blanche countered that the former president's civil fraud trial in New York, which began April 15, would mean Trump \"cannot effectively prepare for this trial by July.\"\n\nBlanche argued the \"easy solution\" would be to start the documents trial in late November, after the election, to avoid \"working ourselves into almost a frenzy.\" Trump's team argued it was a form of \"election interference\" to have the case go to trial in the fall. Prosecutors rejected that assertion, telling Cannon that Justice Department guidelines against bringing charges close to an election do not apply to trials themselves, which are under the jurisdiction of the courts.\n\nSmith brought charges against Trump and two co-defendants -- aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira -- in a sprawling indictment alleging Trump mishandled numerous documents with classified markings and worked with his aides to obstruct the subsequent federal probe.\n\nAll three have pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nSmith has also charged Trump with four counts in Washington, D.C., stemming from his alleged effort to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty in that case as well.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_legare@cbsnews.com", "name": "Robert Legare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "caitlin_yilek@cbsnews.com", "name": "Caitlin Yilek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "melissa_quinn@cbsnews.com", "name": "Melissa Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "cbs_san_francisco@cbsnews.com", "name": "Cbs San Francisco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_transition_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peaceful transition of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/07/4b34ba66-a9a1-4539-a526-2f03e6193633/thumbnail/1200x630/b5f8449e58e33e9b56fda52574408a55/gettyimages-1471924599.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 315, "textEnd": 321}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 2185, "textEnd": 2193}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

While Trump was in criminal court Tuesday for his hush money trial in New York, Cannon's move means there are no trial dates currently set for the other three criminal cases against him.\n\nBy indefinitely postponing the classified documents trial, Cannon's order pushes it closer to the 2024 election - and potentially afterward.\n\nThe judge's new schedule lays out all the legal disputes that Cannon must decide before a jury could hear the case. Cannon said that process will take at least until late July of this year.\n\nCannon noted in her Tuesday order that there are eight substantive pending motions she has yet to decide. She also reiterated that she believes the national security mishandling allegations in the case \"present novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nThough all parties agreed that the case wouldn't be ready to go before a jury in May, prosecutors still pushed for a July trial date, while Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Although Trump's attorneys have continuously asserted in court filings that a pre-election trial would be \"unfair.\"\n\nThe further delayed trial also could put Trump's two federal cases on a collision course.\n\nIn Washington, DC, the former president is charged with alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. That case, also brought by special counsel Jack Smith's team, has been on pause while the Supreme Court considers Trump's claims of sweeping immunity. A decision from the high court is expected by July.\n\nTrump is charged in the Florida case with mishandling classified documents and with working with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, to obstruct the Justice Department's investigation. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nCannon said in her new scheduling order that she will hold a hearing on what had been considered Trump's longshot request for records from the Biden administration.\n\nThe hearing will start on June 24 and is scheduled to last three days.\n\nThe move by Cannon is a significant win for the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The proceeding will give Trump and his attorneys a platform to air unfounded theories about the prosecution, including the accusation that it is politically motivated.\n\nAttorneys for Smith have vehemently denied allegations of political bias and opposed the move to hold the hearing as unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nCannon also scheduled a June 21 hearing on Trump's claims that Smith was unlawfully appointed.\n\nIn his bid for records from the Biden administration, Trump has argued that he is entitled to a broad swath of records from various federal agencies, including from President Joe Biden's White House, because Trump claims those agencies are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nSmith's office countered that Trump's theories were \"baseless,\" that the discovery request was \"frivolous,\" and that the defense lawyers' arguments had fallen well short of the high threshold for holding such a proceeding.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news",

The New York case involves several of the same lawyers representing him in the federal case in Florida.\n\nCannon said in a five-page order Tuesday that it would be \"imprudent\" to finalize a new trial date now, casting further doubt on federal prosecutors' ability to bring Trump to trial before the November presidential election.\n\nTrump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021, and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nTrump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the New York prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election.\n\nThe Supreme Court is weighing Trump's arguments that he is immune from federal prosecution in a separate case from special counsel Jack Smith charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions.\n\nThat outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signaled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\nRead more:\n\nStormy Daniels takes witness stand in Trump hush money trial\n\nTrump says Biden's administration runs 'Gestapo tactics' in latest campaign jab",

classified documents trial postponed indefinitely: Judge's ruling has huge implications on if ex-president avoids trial before the election", "body": "By Charlie Spiering, Senior Political Reporter, Washington, Dc\n\nA federal judge ruled Tuesday that President Donald Trump's trial date for his classified documents case would be postponed, citing ongoing issues with the case.\n\nTrump-appointed District Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the trial would be postponed indefinitely in order to resolve significant pre-trial issues.\n\nCannon wrote that scheduling a date for the case would 'be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.'\n\nDonald Trump's federal classified documents case in Florida was postponed 'indefinitely' on a day of dramatic testimony by Stormy Daniels in a New York courtroom\n\nThe trial was initially scheduled for May 20th.\n\nThe case surrounding Trump's possession of classified documents is considered by legal experts the most significant legal case surrounding the election, as prosecutors accuse him of illegally possessing the documents found in a Justice Department raid at his home at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Justice Department charged Trump with 37 felonies, including the willful retention of classified documents and obstruction of justice and false statements from allegedly trying to impede the investigation.\n\nTrump plead not guilty after he was indicted by the federal government\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith did not immediately reply to the news.\n\nThe timing of the ruling further raises doubts whether the case will go to trial before the 2024 election.\n\nThe ruling came down after a dramatic day of testimony in the Stormy Daniels 'hush money' case in New York.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, had set a May trial date\n\nTrump designated the material as 'personal' when he was still in office before it was shipped to Florida, according to the filing\n\nTrump's classified documents case could be stalled through the election\n\nTrump's legal team has had success slow-walking other trials, and Judge Cannon's ruling raises the possibility the Stormy Daniels case is the only one that goes to trial before November.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided to step in to weigh Trump's claims of immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while president, which stalled his January 6 case in Washington, D.C.\n\nHis Georgia election interference case hit a snag after revelations of an affair between Fulton County DA Fani Willis and her former top prosecutor Nathan Wade.", "source": {"uri":

Last year, Trump was indicted four times in cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, DC.\n\nCannon wrote that \"finally setting a trial date at this point\" would be \"unwise and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pretrial motions pending before the Court, criticizing [Classified Information Procedures Act] questions, and the additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\n\nThe trial in this case was scheduled to begin on May 20. Trump's hush money trial in New York would likely still be underway at that point, but Cannon had also indicated that a host of issues also needed to be resolved, including those relating to use of classified documents in a public proceeding.\n\nTrump faces 40 criminal charges related to his possession of classified documents after leaving the White House. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump also faces trial for conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and stay in power. But that case also doesn't have a trial date, as the Supreme Court considers whether Trump had presidential immunity from prosecution for any of the charges. The court heard oral arguments last month.\n\nThere is also doubt over when the trial will begin in Georgia, where Trump and a host of other defendants face racketeering and other charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in this state.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151166340_d21109.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 855, "textEnd": 861}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Prosecutors meanwhile have pushed for it to take place this year.\n\nBut the 20 May date set by Judge Cannon appeared less and less likely to hold amid slow-moving deliberations over multiple pre-trial issues.\n\nThe former president is accused of keeping top-secret documents in his possession after leaving office, rather than returning them to the National Archives as prescribed by law.\n\nGovernment prosecutors have also alleged that he then obstructed efforts to take back the documents, including by plotting to erase security video at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nMr Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the 40 felony counts against him, which range from conspiracy to obstruct justice to making false statements.\n\nAlso charged alongside him are his personal aide Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, a property manager at Mar-a-Lago. Both men have also pleaded not guilty.\n\nDefence lawyers and prosecutors have repeatedly tussled in court over what classified evidence can be presented at trial, prompting a series of delays.\n\nSome legal commentators have also suggested that Judge Cannon, who has often sided with Mr Trump's arguments, is deliberately slow-walking the case on behalf of the man who appointed her to the court.\n\nIn her Tuesday filing, the judge scheduled additional hearings over pending concerns, including one in late July, and declined to set a new date for the trial to begin.\n\nFinalising a trial date at this juncture, she wrote, \"would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court\".\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court,\" she added.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law expert at the University of Richmond, said that Judge Cannon had failed to act to limit the \"delay tactics\" of Mr Trump's team.\n\n\"Some complications and delays may have been inevitable... but the judge's failure to take control and move the case, or to request help is surprising,\" he said.\n\nMr Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is facing dozens of charges across three other criminal cases and is currently on trial in New York.\n\nBut he is also awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on his claims of presidential immunity, a decision he has argued could influence all the criminal cases against him.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Florida judge indefinitely postpones Trump documents trial", "body": "A Florida judge on Tuesday indefinitely postponed Donald Trump's criminal trial over his alleged mishandling of classified documents, making it unlikely the case will be heard before the November presidential election.\n\nThe former president had been scheduled to go on trial on May 20 but District Judge Aileen Cannon said that was not possible because of the number of pre-trial motions before the court.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, did not set a new date for the start of the federal trial.\n\nThe postponement is a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and makes it unlikely the case will be heard before the election now less than six months away, in which Trump is the Republican presumptive nominee for president.\n\nTrump's attorneys have sought to delay his various criminal cases until after the election, when the 77-year-old Trump could potentially have the federal charges against him dropped if he wins.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York on state charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty in Florida last June to the federal charges of unlawfully retaining national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.\n\nHe kept the classified files -- which included records from the Pentagon, CIA and National Security Agency -- unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and thwarted official efforts to retrieve them, according to the indictment.\n\nCannon, in her order, said the sheer number of pre-trial motions and the classified nature of some of the evidence in the case made it impossible to stick to the May trial date.\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024 trial date,\" she said.\n\nA new date would be \"reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with the Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice,\" Cannon said.\n\nIn addition to the New York and Florida cases, Trump has also been charged in Washington and Georgia with trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, his likely November opponent.\n\ncl/mlm\n\nMore

Smith accused the judge of operating on an \"unstated and fundamentally flawed legal premise\" when she requested that the parties draft different versions of their proposed jury instructions based on their competing interpretations of laws governing classified materials and presidential records.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charisma_madarang@rollingstone.com", "name": "Charisma Madarang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Webster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faye Webster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_&_Imaging_Products_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camera & Imaging Products Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conscription in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Trump-classified-docs-trial-postponed-florida.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 333}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an August 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before November 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specialises in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial.\n\nProsecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signaled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information",

vehemently denied allegations of political bias and opposed the move to hold the hearing as unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nCannon also scheduled a June 21 hearing on Trump's claims that Smith was

Joe Biden's White House, because Trump claims those agencies are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nSmith's office countered that Trump's theories were \"baseless,\" that the discovery

The Washington Post reported in September of the same year that some materials related to US nuclear secrets, Iran's missile program, and Washington's intelligence activities in China.\n\nA year later, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami, Florida. The former president has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial was initially set to begin on May 20, 2024. However, in a ruling on Tuesday, US District Judge Aileen Cannon reset the date for trial, arguing that there were eight substantive pending motions on which she has yet to decide. The judge also said she believed the national security mishandling allegations to \"present novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nCannon said that the finalization of a trial date at this point \"would be imprudent and inconsistent with the court's duty to fully and fairly consider\" numerous issues in the case, noting that \"additional pretrial and trial preparations [are] necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nTrump's legal team had previously argued that holding the trial too close to the election, which is scheduled for November, could lead to election interference.\n\nWith the new ruling, it is unclear whether the trial will start before the election, in which Trump is almost certain to face a rematch with US President Joe Biden. The Washington Post noted that, if the GOP frontrunner were to win the election, he could appoint an attorney general who would drop the federal charges against him. The Justice Department also has a long-standing policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nTrump, who is the first former president in US history to face criminal charges, is also fighting several other legal battles.

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nThe criminal trial over former US President Donald Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents was on Tuesday indefinitely postponed by a Florida judge, making it unlikely that the case will be heard before the presidential elections slated to be held in November this year, news agency AFP reported.\n\nTrump, who is also facing trial in New York for a hush money case, was fined for the 10th time on May 7 for violating a gag order and was even warned by the judge of a possible jail time. Currently, he is on trial for in New York on state charges for falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe trial pertaining to the classififed documents was supposed to be heard on May 20. However, the District Judge Aileen Cannon postponed it stating that it was not possible to be heard because of the several pre-trial motions before the court. A Trump apointee herself, Cannon, did not set a new date for the commencement of the federal trial.\n\nThis development will pose as a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith, who is the one who slapped the charges against the former president.\n\nThe US presidential elections is now less than six months away and will witness Trump, who is a Republican presumptive nominee fight the eloctoral battle against the Democrats' Joe Biden.\n\nTrump's attorneys have been seeking to delay several criminal cases against him and push them until after the election, when it would possibly be easier for the 77-year-old former president to have the federal charges dropped against him if he wrests the White House from Joe Biden, the AFP report noted.\n\nWhat Is the Classified Documents Case Against Trump?\n\nAccording to the indicment, Trump withheld classified files, which included record from CIA, National Security Agency, and Pentagon, in an unsecured way at his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, and thwarted the efforts by the officials to retrieve them, AFP reported.\n\nIn June last year, Trump pleaded not guilty in Florida to 40 federal charges accusing him of unlawfully retaining sensitive national defence information (Espionage Act), making false statements, and conspiracy to obstruct justice after leaving office in 2021.\n\nIn her order, Cannon stated that the sheer number of pre-trial motions in addition to the classified nature of some of the evidence in the case, makes it impossible for the trial to be carried out in May.\n\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024 trial date,\"Cannon stated.\n\nThe Florida judge further stated that a new date would be \"reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with the Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice,\" the AFP report noted.\n\nApart from the the New York and Florida cases, the former president has also been charged in Georgia and Washington for trying to overturn the 2020 election results won by Democrat Joe Biden, who would likely be his opponent in November elections.",

Cannon ruled Tuesday, increasing the chance that Trump's New York criminal trial may be the only one to happen before the November election.\n\nThis image, contained in the indictment against former President Donald Trump, shows boxes of records stored in a bathroom and shower in the Lake Room at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Justice Department via AP\n\nThe judge had originally set the trial date for late May and heard arguments on March 1 about when the trial should be - with Trump's lawyers pushing to start after the presidential election, in which he is the presumptive Republican nominee, or no earlier than August.\n\nProsecutors urged Cannon to pick a date in early July.\n\nBut in her ruling, the judge said there are too many complicated legal rules and deadlines surrounding the use of classified evidence in public criminal trials that need to be considered before she finalizes a court date. She said she would schedule the trial date at a future time.\n\nCases that involve classified documents have to follow the rules and legal proceedings defined under the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA.\n\nIn her order Tuesday, Cannon set a number of new pre-trial deadlines that parties will have to meet. The latest deadline is a CIPA-related deadline for July 22 - which means the trial will not happen before then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture-before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming-would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nTrump is the first former U.S. president to be charged with crimes. He faces four separate indictments as he campaigns for another term in the White House, an unprecedented test of the nation's legal and political systems. The timing of each case - including a state trial in New York that began April 15 - has grown increasingly consequential as he draws closer to a general election rematch against President Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\nHis D.C. federal trial for allegedly trying to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election victory is on hold while the Supreme Court weighs his claim that he is immune from prosecutions for actions he took as president. There is no trial date set yet in Georgia, where Trump is charged with a broad conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in that state.\n\nIn Florida, Trump is charged with dozens of counts of mishandling classified information after his presidency ended and plotting with two aides to obstruct government efforts to recover the material from Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach home and private club. He has filed multiple motions seeking to dismiss the charges on a variety of claims.\n\nProsecutors have accused Trump of taking hundreds of classified documents with him when he left the White House. The Washington Post has previously reported that some of the material was related to nuclear secrets, Iran's missile program and U.S. intelligence efforts in China.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

The judge in Trump's classified documents case in Florida ruled yesterday that the trial, previously scheduled to begin on May 20, is not feasible and postponed it. No new trial date was announced. This casts doubt on the possibility that the trial could even begin before the election in November. Judge Aileen Cannon declared that it would be \"imprudent\" to set a new trial date at this time because of unresolved issues that still plague the case as well as the fact that some of the lawyers who would be involved are currently tied up with the \"hush money\" case taking place in New York. (Associated Press)\n\nThe federal judge in Florida presiding over the classified documents prosecution of former President Donald Trump has canceled the May 20 trial date, postponing it indefinitely.\n\nThe order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had been expected in light of still-unresolved issues in the case and because Trump is currently on trial in a separate case in Manhattan charging him in connection with hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. The New York case involves several of the same lawyers representing him in the federal case in Florida.\n\nCannon said in a five-page order Tuesday that it would be \"imprudent\" to finalize a new trial date now, casting further doubt on federal prosecutors' ability to bring Trump to trial before the November presidential election.\n\nIt's worth noting the focus that the AP coverage of this news places on the timing of the anticipated trial in terms of the election. Under more \"normal\" circumstances, that wouldn't even be a consideration. Trials take place when both the prosecution and the defense are prepared to move forward. Relatively simple, straightforward cases can move to trial quickly while more complicated allegations can take quite a while to resolve. But Trump has been surging in the polls lately while Joe Biden is roughly as popular as an impacted wisdom tooth, so the left is desperate to keep Trump off the campaign trail and, if possible, put him behind bars.\n\nThe reactions in the media from liberals were predictable. The New Republic called Judge Cannon \"shameless\" and said that she may have \"killed\" the case altogether. Raw Story declared that the judge was being \"shredded\" over her decision. Newsweek declared that she is \"out of her league.\" Of course, nothing in Cannon's ruling so much as suggested anything about Donald Trump's innocence or guilt or questioned whether he should stand trial. These were simple procedural difficulties that made the original trial date impractical.\n\nThe classified documents case is a complicated one that presents problems for both Donald Trump and the Democrats seeking to engage in lawfare against him. On the one hand, it is arguably the strongest of the four cases against Trump because it seems very likely that the law was broken when he removed classified documents and retained them after leaving office without first officially declassifying them. But at the same time, what he did seems paltry compared to the massive mishandling of classified material by both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton (including intentional destruction of evidence in the latter case) with neither of them ever being charged. Their hypocrisy is evident, but the Democrats don't seem to care because this was never about the law. It's all about trying to keep Trump out of office and off the ballot if possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the supposed \"hush money\" trial has gone completely off the rails now that Stormy Daniels has testified. Legal analysts have piled on, saying that her testimony was completely inappropriate and almost entirely unrelated to the unspecified charges that the District Attorney is trying to pursue. If the case were being handled by an unbiased judge in any location less solidly blue than Manhattan, it would have already been dismissed. But Trump is facing a stacked deck there and they may still manage to get a conviction, though the odds seem longer now than they did a month ago.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/110/9d3eacac-9c2c-43d5-b890-bd5c432e940c.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 340, "textEnd": 346, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing U.S. government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signaled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Will Dunham and Scott Malone)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"},

This decision means that there are currently no trial dates set for the other three criminal cases against Trump.\n\nThe indefinite postponement of the classified documents trial by Judge Cannon could potentially push it closer to the 2024 election or beyond, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe new schedule outlined by the judge details the legal disputes that must be resolved before the case can proceed to trial by jury. Judge Cannon stated that this process would take at least until late July of the current year.\n\nIn her order, Judge Cannon highlighted that there are eight substantive pending motions that she has yet to decide. She also acknowledged the complexity of the national security mishandling allegations in the case, describing them as \"novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nWhile all parties agreed that the case would not be ready for trial by May, prosecutors advocated for a trial date in July, whereas Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Trump's legal team has consistently argued in court filings that holding a trial before the election would be unfair.\n\nThe further delay in the trial could potentially result in Trump's two federal cases converging.\n\nIn Washington, DC, Trump faces charges related to alleged crimes committed during his presidency aimed at overturning the 2020 election results. This case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith's team, has been paused while the Supreme Court deliberates on Trump's claims of extensive immunity. A ruling from the Supreme Court is anticipated by July, according to CNN.\n\nIn the Florida case, Trump is accused of mishandling classified documents and obstructing the Justice Department's investigation in collaboration with co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. All three defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nJudge Cannon announced in her new scheduling order that she will conduct a hearing on Trump's request for records from the Biden administration, previously considered a longshot. The hearing is scheduled to begin on June 24 and is expected to last three days.\n\nThis decision by Judge Cannon represents a significant victory for Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The hearing will provide Trump and his legal team with an opportunity to present unfounded theories about the prosecution, including claims of political motivation.\n\nAttorneys representing special counsel Jack Smith have vehemently refuted allegations of political bias and opposed the decision to hold the hearing, considering it unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nAdditionally, Judge Cannon has scheduled a hearing for June 21 to address Trump's assertions that Smith's appointment was unlawful.\n\nTrump's request for records from the Biden administration is grounded in the argument that various federal agencies, including those within President Joe Biden's White House, are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nHowever, Smith's office has dismissed these claims as baseless and the discovery request as frivolous, asserting that the defence's arguments do not meet the required threshold for such a proceeding, CNN reported.

She otherwise shuffled the schedule to spend more time on legal issues raised as far back as February.\n\nTrump's other federal charges are also facing roadblocks to reaching trial before the election, with proceedings in his Jan. 6 case on pause until the Supreme Court resolves a bid by the former president to toss the case by arguing he is immune from prosecution as a onetime executive.\n\nAnd the possibility of any Trump trial in Georgia in his election interference case there took a hit when a state appeals court on Wednesday agreed to review a lower court's decision not to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) following her romantic relationship with another prosecutor on the case.\n\nThe mounting issues present a series of new wrinkles to any of the cases reaching trial before the election. If Trump wins the White House, his Justice Department would almost certainly drop all charges.\n\n\"It is entirely possible that the Manhattan case is the only one that makes it to verdict before the election,\" said Brad Moss, a national security attorney. Trump is now under trial in New York concerning allegations about covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to conceal an affair.\n\n\"Georgia and the Mar-a-Lago documents cases are almost certainly delayed at this point. The D.C. election fraud case hinges on how and when SCOTUS rules. It is possible but by no means certain that the fall campaign could see that trial take place. Or it could remain bogged down in legal fights too,\" Moss said.\n\nIn a Tuesday order issued less than two weeks before Trump's trial in the documents case was set to begin, Cannon laid out a new calendar for considering numerous motions and other issues raised by Trump.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nShe noted that she still has \"eight substantive pretrial motions\" she must rule on, including various arguments by Trump seeking to kill the case.\n\nCannon is spending considerable time on issues that some outside observers say other judges likely would have addressed more quickly.\n\nHer decision also punts until midsummer litigation over how the classified information at issue in the case will be presented in court -- a process governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA).\n\n\"By delaying the CIPA proceedings even further, Judge Cannon has effectively set the case back at least three months when compared to the schedule DOJ last proposed, which had the case going to trial in July,\" Brian Greer, a former CIA attorney, told The Hill.\n\n\"In light of this, it's going to be almost impossible to have the trial prior to the election.\"\n\nNow on the calendar are three days devoted to exploring a motion from Trump that prosecutors described as \"difficult to decipher\" that seeks to expand the scope of who must turn over evidence in the case. Trump argues he needs information from the White House and various intelligence agencies due to political animus.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any precedent for a court holding an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Intelligence Community is within the scope of the prosecution team. The role of the IC agencies is to work with prosecutors to protect their classified equities in the documents that were compromised by Trump,\" Greer said.\n\n\"They are victims of crime, not prosecutors of it.\"\n\nWhile the Justice Department has tangled with Cannon before -- it challenged and got reversed her order installing a special master to review the documents -- the new schedule is not appealable.\n\n\"Cannon isn't going anywhere,\" Moss said. \"She has carefully ensured her actions on substance don't merit appeal to the 11th Circuit, and her procedural actions easily fall within her discretionary authority.\"\n\n\"No one other than Judge Cannon really knows why she is doing things this way. It may be inexperience, it may be deliberate obfuscation, or it may just be that she wants to be thoroughly comprehensive and cautious in her approach to the issues. Another judge probably would have handled this differently, but Judge Cannon is the one to whom the case was assigned, and that is just the way the cookie crumbles,\" he added.\n\nWhat about the Jan. 6 case?\n\nThe inaction on the Mar-a-Lago case does clear the way, however, for progress in the federal Jan. 6 case.\n\nBut that case is facing its own circular route to a trial -- one that could easily end up at the Supreme Court for a second time.\n\nTrump has asked the Supreme Court to toss the case, arguing the criminal immunity presidents enjoy while in office carry over once they are no longer an executive.\n\nDuring the April trial, the Supreme Court seemed open to carving out some type of immunity for former presidents, suggesting the case could be remanded back to the federal circuit court for further review of Trump's claims.\n\nIf that's the case, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan would once again weigh Trump's immunity argument in light of the high court's guidance.\n\nTrump's team might then appeal her determination -- setting the stage for yet another lengthy battle to work its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nSuch a pathway would be similar to Trump's efforts to block Congress's efforts to review his tax returns, an issue weighed by the justices both in 2020 and then again in 2021.\n\nIt's possible the Supreme Court could rule against Trump, paving the way for resumption of the Jan. 6 case ahead of the election. Prosecutors recently indicated during a hearing in the Mar-a-Lago case that continuing to trial in a case where charges have already been filed would not violate the DOJ's guidance against pursuing litigation in the 60 days ahead of an election.\n\nGeorgia case faces potential Willis detour\n\nAnd in Georgia, prosecutors faced another setback when the Georgia Court of Appeals granted the request from Trump and several allies charged alongside him to review their bid to disqualify Willis.\n\nThat battle already led to a months-long detour that forced Willis and prosecutor Nathan Wade to testify about their relationship.\n\nTrump's team has yet to file a motion to pause proceedings in the lower court while the appeals court considers their challenge, but it remains an option.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news",

documents trial", "body": "Judge Aileen Cannon has indefinitely postponed former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago documents case, punting some court dates into late July while declining to set a trial date.\n\nThe Tuesday order -- issued less than two weeks before Trump's trial was still on the books to kick off on May 20 -- leaves unclear when Trump's case will ever come before a jury.\n\nCannon pinned the delay on the need to resolve numerous issues dealing with how classified information will be handled at trial, details governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA).\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent

one of the first requests by Trump's legal team -- to not set a trial date.\n\nThe last-minute scuttling of the trial date comes as Cannon has failed to act on a number of motions before her, including numerous efforts by Trump urging her to toss the case.\n\nIn laying out the new schedule, Cannon noted that she still has \"eight substantive pretrial motions\" she must rule on.\n\nThe new slate of trial deadlines pushes until July most of the litigation on CIPA, which will determine how classified information is presented at trial.\n\nCannon earlier Tuesday suspended another CIPA-related deadline in the case after Trump's legal team complained about prosecutors' handling of the documents.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith's team acknowledged in court filings last week that some boxes of documents may not have been preserved in the exact order they were found but dismissed the significance of the detail in preparing for trial.\n\n\"The filter team took care to ensure that no documents were moved from one box to another, but it was not focused on maintaining the sequence of documents within each box,\" prosecutors wrote in a Friday filing.\n\nThey also noted that Trump's co-defendant and valet Walt Nauta \"failed to raise with the Government his current 'issue' about intra-box sequencing until over nine months after the boxes were made available to him.\"",

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election on November 5. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signalled support for Trump's defence on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognise that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions.\n\nThat outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an August 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and

Judge Cannon is not exactly handling herself well.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has been on the federal bench for less than four years, and yet is likely already in the midst of the most consequential case of her legal career. Yet Cannon consistently has shown little urgency to match the import of special counsel Jack Smith's classified documents case against former President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Cannon announced that the trial for the man who appointed her will be postponed indefinitely due to the large number of pretrial issues that have yet to be resolved.\n\nTo say that Cannon finds herself in an entirely avoidable situation is an understatement. The primary speed bump preventing a swift speedy resolution of the issues she cites in explaining her delay is none other than Cannon herself. It's impossible at this juncture to definitively apportion the blame for this cascading failure on inexperience, partisan malice and simply being dealt a bum hand. What is clear though is that Cannon has made what should have been one of the most straightforward cases against Trump into a quagmire of her own creation.\n\nOn paper, Cannon largely blames the slow-moving process on the Classified Information Procedures Act, a 1980 law that lays out rules for the use of classified documents in criminal trials. \"Finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" she wrote in Tuesday's order.\n\nIt's true that cases covered by CIPA do tend to be more difficult to handle than those with less potentially sensitive charges, as judges balance the accused's ability to mount a viable defense without revealing government secrets. Cannon is clearly aware of charges that she is intentionally slow-rolling the case: In a footnote to Tuesday's order, she says that since March she has heard and resolved five motions from the defense, including Trump and co-defendants, as well as multiple CIPA-related motions. She adds that she's ruled upon other matters as well in the weeks since March, including redaction and sealing requests and \"other miscellaneous motions.\" It's an impressive list -- but not exactly one that inspires sympathy when you consider some of the reasons why she may be struggling to handle the workload.\n\nCannon's name first became widely known soon after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 and seized boxes of documents that Trump had refused to return to the federal government, which were found to include hundreds of pages of classified documents. When Trump's lawyers demanded a \"special master\" to slow down the Justice Department's examination of the seized material, citing \"executive privilege,\" Cannon obliged. Her ruling was smacked down in the usually very conservative 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, but not before it drew a lot of scrutiny on Cannon and the fact that she was a Trump appointee.\n\nLawyer and legal commentator David Lat wrote last month that in the special master case, \"Judge Cannon thought like a pointy-headed appellate judge, not a commonsensical trial judge,\" seizing on the novel legal issues at play rather than the matter directly at hand. This led to her \"grossly overthinking the matter\" and issuing an opinion that \"was too clever by half -- and just plain wrong -- which is why the Eleventh Circuit made short work of it,\" he continued in his Substack newsletter. Since then, Lat reported, Cannon's office has struggled with the heavy workload, higher than normal turnover in her chambers, the required clearances her clerks need to handle classified material, and a new propensity for micromanaging given the increased scrutiny on her after the special master ruling.\n\nIt's entirely possible that a more experienced judge would be facing similar problems. But that Cannon is even in a position to make these decisions is due to an almost literary twist of fate. There are more than two dozen federal district judges in the southern district of Florida. Cases are assigned at random among them. It is only through the luck of the draw that Trump would see his classified documents case fall before Cannon. With the shadow of the special master case looming over her, she's opted to take her time to get things right. Yet that has opened her up to an entirely different set of criticisms. That includes her frankly bizarre decision to have the prosecution and defense spend time on crafting potential jury instructions and arguments regarding the Presidential Records Act rather than deal with the more pressing issues on her plate.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone who isn't a co-defendant in this case, Cannon's careful treading fits perfectly with Trump's preferred strategy of delaying his court appearances for as long as possible. The trial had originally been scheduled to begin on May 20 -- though given that Trump is in the middle of a separate criminal trial in New York, that was clearly not going to happen. Both Smith, who brought the charges against Trump last year, and the former president's lawyers agreed that a delay would be necessary. Smith's team argued that a summer trial was still possible, while Trump naturally pushed for a trial date after Election Day. Since a hearing on the matter in March, Cannon had only given hints at when a rescheduled trial would take place, the last of which was Monday when she bumped back a key CIPA-related filing deadline.\n\nAgain, the evidentiary role of classified material would likely slow down any criminal trial, let alone one involving a former president.

The trial start date was initially scheduled for May 20.\n\nCannon wrote that \"finally setting a trial date at this point...would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pretrial motions pending before the Court, criticizing [Classified Information Procedures Act] questions, and the additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\n\nThe special prosecutor declined to comment.\n\nCannon's long-awaited scheduling order came more than two months after hearing arguments from the legal teams representing Trump and special counsel Jack Smith. The former president's lawyers urged her to avoid taking the case to trial before the next 2024 presidential election, but they also admitted that if Cannon decides to move forward, August or September would be feasible . Prosecutors said they would be ready to stand trial in July.\n\n\"The only thing the parties can agree on is that this case can go to trial this summer,\" Assistant Special Prosecutor Jay Bratt argued in court in March. Cannon called some of the Justice Department's proposed pretrial deadlines \"unrealistic\" and said she needed space in the case to \"allow for some flexibility.\"\n\nAt the same hearing, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche countered that the former president's civil fraud trial in New York, which began April 15, would mean Trump \"cannot effectively prepare for this trial by July.\"\n\nBlanche argued that the \"easy way out\" would be to begin the trial of the documents in late November, after the election, to avoid \"pushing ourselves into a sort of frenzy.\" Trump's team argued that having the case go to trial in the fall constituted a form of \"election interference.\" Prosecutors rejected that assertion, telling Cannon that Justice Department guidelines against bringing charges near an election do not apply to the trials themselves, which are within the jurisdiction of the courts.\n\nSmith filed charges against Trump and two co-defendants -- his aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira -- in a sprawling indictment alleging that Trump mishandled numerous documents bearing classified marks and had worked with his aides to obstruct the ensuing federal investigation.\n\nAll three have pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe delay comes amid an ongoing dispute between Trump's legal team, his co-defendants and special counsel Jack Smith over the placement of classified documents into evidence. Trump's lawyers have claimed in recent days that markers for the classified documents he is accused of mishandling were not properly placed in evidence boxes.\n\nThe special prosecutor noted this discrepancy last week and has revealed in the past that the documents had been reviewed by the relevant intelligence community agencies. The defendants say these discrepancies raise questions about the investigation.\n\nSmith also charged Trump with four counts in Washington, D.C., stemming from his alleged efforts to thwart the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in that case. That case remains on hold while the Supreme Court reviews Trump's presidential immunity claims. A High Court decision is likely by June.\n\nScott MacFarlane contributed to this report.\n\nInvestigations into Trump More More Robert Legare\n\nRobert Legare is a CBS News multi-platform reporter and producer who covers the Justice Department, federal courts and investigations.

While Trump was in criminal court Tuesday for his hush money trial in New York, Cannon's move means there are no trial dates currently set for the other three criminal cases against him.\n\nBy indefinitely postponing the classified documents trial, Cannon's order pushes it closer to the 2024 election - and potentially afterward.\n\nThe judge's new schedule lays out all the legal disputes that Cannon must decide before a jury could hear the case. Cannon said that process will take at least until late July of this year.\n\nCannon noted in her Tuesday order that there are eight substantive pending motions she has yet to decide. She also reiterated that she believes the national security mishandling allegations in the case \"present novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nThough all parties agreed that the case wouldn't be ready to go before a jury in May, prosecutors still pushed for a July trial date, while Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Although Trump's attorneys have continuously asserted in court filings that a pre-election trial would be \"unfair.\"\n\nThe further delayed trial also could put Trump's two federal cases on a collision course.\n\nIn Washington, DC, the former president is charged with alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. That case, also brought by special counsel Jack Smith's team, has been on pause while the Supreme Court considers Trump's claims of sweeping immunity. A decision from the high court is expected by July.\n\nTrump is charged in the Florida case with mishandling classified documents and with working with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, to obstruct the Justice Department's investigation. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nCannon said in her new scheduling order that she will hold a hearing on what had been considered Trump's longshot request for records from the Biden administration.\n\nThe hearing will start on June 24 and is scheduled to last three days.\n\nThe move by Cannon is a significant win for the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The proceeding will give Trump and his attorneys a platform to air unfounded theories about the prosecution, including the accusation that it is politically motivated.\n\nAttorneys for Smith have vehemently denied allegations of political bias and opposed the move to hold the hearing as unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nCannon also scheduled a June 21 hearing on Trump's claims that Smith was unlawfully appointed.\n\nIn his bid for records from the Biden administration, Trump has argued that he is entitled to a broad swath of records from various federal agencies, including from President Joe Biden's White House, because Trump claims those agencies are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nSmith's office countered that Trump's theories were \"baseless,\" that the discovery request was \"frivolous,\" and that the defense lawyers' arguments had fallen well short of the high threshold for holding such a proceeding.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election on November 5. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signalled support for Trump's defence on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognise that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions.\n\nThat outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an August 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and

While Trump was in criminal court Tuesday for his hush money trial in New York, Cannon's move means there are no trial dates currently set for the other three criminal cases against him.\n\nBy indefinitely postponing the classified documents trial, Cannon's order pushes it closer to the 2024 election - and potentially afterward.\n\nThe judge's new schedule lays out all the legal disputes that Cannon must decide before a jury could hear the case. Cannon said that process will take at least until late July of this year.\n\nCannon noted in her Tuesday order that there are eight substantive pending motions she has yet to decide. She also reiterated that she believes the national security mishandling allegations in the case \"present novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nThough all parties agreed that the case wouldn't be ready to go before a jury in May, prosecutors still pushed for a July trial date, while Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Although Trump's attorneys have continuously asserted in court filings that a pre-election trial would be \"unfair.\"\n\nThe further delayed trial also could put Trump's two federal cases on a collision course.\n\nIn Washington, DC, the former president is charged with alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. That case, also brought by special counsel Jack Smith's team, has been on pause while the Supreme Court considers Trump's claims of sweeping immunity. A decision from the high court is expected by July.\n\nTrump is charged in the Florida case with mishandling classified documents and with working with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, to obstruct the Justice Department's investigation. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nCannon said in her new scheduling order that she will hold a hearing on what had been considered Trump's longshot request for records from the Biden administration.\n\nThe hearing will start on June 24 and is scheduled to last three days.\n\nThe move by Cannon is a significant win for the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The proceeding will give Trump and his attorneys a platform to air unfounded theories about the prosecution, including the accusation that it is politically motivated.\n\nAttorneys for Smith have vehemently denied allegations of political bias and opposed the move to hold the hearing as unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nCannon also scheduled a June 21 hearing on Trump's claims that Smith was unlawfully appointed.\n\nIn his bid for records from the Biden administration, Trump has argued that he is entitled to a broad swath of records from various federal agencies, including from President Joe Biden's White House, because Trump claims those agencies are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nSmith's office countered that Trump's theories were \"baseless,\" that the discovery request was \"frivolous,\" and that the defense lawyers' arguments had fallen well short of the high threshold for holding such a proceeding.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news",

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing U.S. government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signaled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Will Dunham and Scott Malone)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors":

This decision means that there are currently no trial dates set for the other three criminal cases against Trump.\n\nAlso Read | AstraZeneca Withdraws COVID-19 Vaccine Worldwide, Cites Commercial Reasons Amid Side-Effect Row.\n\nThe indefinite postponement of the classified documents trial by Judge Cannon could potentially push it closer to the 2024 election or beyond, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe new schedule outlined by the judge details the legal disputes that must be resolved before the case can proceed to trial by jury. Judge Cannon stated that this process would take at least until late July of the current year.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Ukrainian Secret Service Uncovers 'Russian Plots' Against Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn her order, Judge Cannon highlighted that there are eight substantive pending motions that she has yet to decide. She also acknowledged the complexity of the national security mishandling allegations in the case, describing them as \"novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nWhile all parties agreed that the case would not be ready for trial by May, prosecutors advocated for a trial date in July, whereas Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Trump's legal team has consistently argued in court filings that holding a trial before the election would be unfair.\n\nThe further delay in the trial could potentially result in Trump's two federal cases converging.\n\nIn Washington, DC, Trump faces charges related to alleged crimes committed during his presidency aimed at overturning the 2020 election results. This case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith's team, has been paused while the Supreme Court deliberates on Trump's claims of extensive immunity. A ruling from the Supreme Court is anticipated by July, according to CNN.\n\nIn the Florida case, Trump is accused of mishandling classified documents and obstructing the Justice Department's investigation in collaboration with co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. All three defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nJudge Cannon announced in her new scheduling order that she will conduct a hearing on Trump's request for records from the Biden administration, previously considered a longshot. The hearing is scheduled to begin on June 24 and is expected to last three days.\n\nThis decision by Judge Cannon represents a significant victory for Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The hearing will provide Trump and his legal team with an opportunity to present unfounded theories about the prosecution, including claims of political motivation.\n\nAttorneys representing special counsel Jack Smith have vehemently refuted allegations of political bias and opposed the decision to hold the hearing, considering it unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nAdditionally, Judge Cannon has scheduled a hearing for June 21 to address Trump's assertions that Smith's appointment was unlawful.\n\nTrump's request for records from the Biden administration is grounded in the argument that various federal agencies, including those within President Joe Biden's White House, are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nHowever, Smith's office has dismissed these claims as baseless and the discovery request as frivolous, asserting that the defence's arguments do not meet the required threshold for such a proceeding, CNN reported.

But many legal experts responded to the action by saying that such considerations have been incredibly generous to Trump, who is seeking to become president again in this fall's elections, and who, if he wins, can appoint an attorney general who will dismiss the case altogether.\n\nTrump is accused of removing thousands of government documents, hundreds of them marked classified, from the White House after his departure from office. Public evidence of Trump's actions demonstrates that, after agreeing to turn over the classified documents to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the early summer of 2022, he knowingly held on to at least 100 additional materials, stashing them in various unsecured locations at Mar-a-Lago mere steps from areas that could be accessed by guests.\n\nBecause the charges against Trump involve classified documents, several considerations have to be made regarding how the documents are presented as evidence at trial, in compliance with rules established under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA). It's not unusual for trials to undergo brief delays in order to hear CIPA concerns from both the prosecution and defense teams, and Cannon made clear in her ruling that this was why she was indefinitely suspending the start of the trial.\n\nThe court \"determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court,\" Cannon stated in her opinion.\n\nThe order included a rescheduling of pretrial hearings, with the latest occurring in late July. The delays, plus the possibility of other motions from Trump's legal team between now and then, mean the trial is unlikely to take place before the election.\n\nCannon, who is inexperienced in these types of trials, has been subject to widespread criticism from legal experts, who have noted that the delays she's granting are unusual and that she has made exceptions for Trump in pretrial motions despite him now being a private citizen. Critics have also pointed out that Trump was the one who appointed Cannon to the position in which she now serves.\n\n\"Her incompetence is so gross that I think it clearly creates the perception of partiality and her attempt to put her thumb on the scale,\" said former White House lawyer Ty Cobb, who served in the Trump administration but has since become a vocal critic of his former boss.\n\nSome commentators have even suggested that DOJ special counsel Jack Smith should seek to have Cannon removed from the case.\n\n\"Based on the totality of the circumstances of MAGA Judge Cannon's handling of the docs case, I do believe Smith must ask for her removal on grounds of both bias & incompetence,\" former assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Signorelli said on X. \"Nothing to lose now, everything to gain.

He now has a chance to dodge it entirely.", "body": "Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago documents trial has been delayed indefinitely. It's now extremely unlike that it would take place before the 2024 election. The scheduling may allow Trump to get rid of the case if he's elected president.\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal case over his holding onto secret government documents following his presidency delayed the trial indefinitely -- giving him the chance to get rid of the charges if he wins the 2024 election.\n\nIn an order Tuesday afternoon, US District Judge Aileen Cannon scheduled more than a dozen more hearings and deadlines for lawyers through July. The trial, she said, couldn't happen until she decided \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining,\" referring to laws related to handling classified information.\n\nCannon -- who Trump nominated for the judgeship while he was in the White House -- had previously scheduled jury selection to commence on May 20, but it had long been clear the trial would not be ready to take place by then.\n\nFor months, lawyers for Trump and his two co-defendants -- Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira and aide Waltine Nauta -- had been sparring with federal prosecutors over how to share discovery information, which includes classified documents.\n\nJustice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith, in an indictment last June, accused Trump of violating a slew of criminal national security and obstruction laws by spiriting away sensitive government documents from the White House to Mar-a-Lago and other personal properties, holding on to them after his presidency, and lying about it to authorities.\n\nThe co-defendants, de Oliveira and Nauta, each helped Trump hide the documents and mislead investigators, prosecutors alleged. (A PAC controlled by Trump is paying lawyers representing de Oliveira and Nauta with political donor funds.)\n\nTrump's busy trial schedule is playing out in the thick of the 2024 election\n\nIt's one of four ongoing criminal cases against Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2024 election and the only former president to be charged with any crime.\n\nTrump is currently about halfway through his first criminal trial, in Manhattan, where prosecutors accused Trump of illegally falsifying business records when he covered up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with him, ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nUnlike in civil cases -- Trump recently went through two -- criminal cases generally require that the defendant be present during the entire trial, making scheduling a complicated task.\n\nTrump may also have the power, if he were to be reelected president, to dispose of the cases brought by the Justice Department.\n\nAnother criminal case overseen by Smith, in a federal court in Washington, DC, was previously scheduled for March 4. In that case, Smith alleged Trump broke criminal laws through his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But it has been paused as the US Supreme Court weighs whether Trump would be immune from prosecution in the case, and may not be decided in time to complete the trial process before the 2024 election.\n\nTrump's attorneys have also made immunity arguments in the classified documents case.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis also brought election interference charges against Trump, for trying to overturn the results in Georgia. That case is not expected to go to trial until 2025 at the earliest.\n\nAt a hearing in February for the New York case, Juan Merchan, the presiding judge, grew impatient with Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, as he tried to lodge the trial from its original March 25 start date. Blanche is also the lead attorney representing Trump in the government documents case.\n\n\"Stop interrupting me, please,\" Merchan said, when Blanche said the Florida case might move forward in May. \"You don't have a trial date, not a real one.\"\n\nBlanche had suggested that everyone reconvene in March and then decide on a new schedule going forward. Merchan held firm, pointing out that the DC case had been indefinitely delayed, and that he expected the Manhattan trial to last six weeks -- meaning it would end even if Cannon had held onto her May start date.\n\n\"I'm sure that the trial cannot start on May 20th if this trial is ongoing May 20th and Mr. Trump is present in this courtroom on May 20th, which I don't expect,\" Merchan said. \"I expect this trial to last about six weeks. Even so, we can't have two simultaneous criminal trials.\"\n\nMerchan later pushed back the trial to April, based on a last-minute snafu related to the production of new records from a separate criminal investigation from federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stormy Daniels took the stand, testifying about sex she says she had with Trump in 2006 -- and threats she said she experienced later.\n\nTrump filed several motions to dismiss the Florida case in February, claiming he's immune from criminal charges and that it was OK for him to hold on to the records.\n\nCannon has thus far declined to dismiss the case on some of Trump's arguments, but is weighing others.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType":

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing U.S. government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signaled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Will Dunham and Scott Malone)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, said on Tuesday the trial would no longer begin May 20 but did not set a new date.\n\nDonald Trump's trial in Florida on charges of illegally keeping classified documents after leaving office has been indefinitely postponed, a judge decided on Tuesday, greatly reducing the odds he will face a jury in either of the two federal criminal cases against him before the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Trump, seeking to regain the presidency, previously had been scheduled to go to trial on May 20 in the documents case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, but the prosecution and defense had both acknowledged that date would need to be delayed.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, said on Tuesday the trial would no longer begin May 20 but did not set a new date. Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing U.S. government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago. Smith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Trump's defense on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to recognize that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions. That outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield. Trump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an Aug. 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump's lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces. \"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators. In an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump's legal team. \"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself. Smith's team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signaled that Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith claimed that Trump tried to hide the documents from authorities, including storing boxes in a bathroom at the mansion.\n\nThe documents case, considered by some legal experts to be the strongest of four criminal cases brought against Trump, is one of a pair brought by Smith, who also indicted the former president for his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 elections.\n\nThat case is stalled while the U.S. Supreme Court decides the scope of Trump's immunity for acts committed while in office. A trial in another Georgia election interference case has yet to be scheduled, after a delay caused in part by the withdrawal of a special prosecutor who had a romantic relationship with the prosecutor.\n\nThe documents case moved slowly, as Trump's lawyers found a sympathetic ear in Cannon. Following a series of motions that made the original May 20 trial date unfeasible, the former president's legal team recommended a new trial date of August 12, while reiterating its position that a A fair trial cannot take place until after the conclusion of the 2024 presidential election. Smith requested the trial begin on July 8.\n\nNeither date now appears possible, with Cannon having scheduled a series of pretrial hearings through the end of July.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The DoJ declined to comment.\n\nRecommended\n\nIt is the general policy of the DoJ not to initiate politically sensitive prosecutions within 60 days of an election. But a prosecutor told Cannon that a trial within that time frame would not violate that unwritten rule because charges had already been filed.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, the maximum prison sentence for each of his 40 counts ranges from five to 20 years.\n\nBecause the case is federal, some have speculated that Trump might attempt to pardon himself if elected president, or that he might at least attempt to influence the matter through his DoJ appointees.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Boxes of documents were removed from the White House during his final days in office and stored at Mar-a-Lago in easily accessible ballrooms, restrooms and elsewhere on the sprawling estate.\n\nFederal agents raided Mar-a-Lago in 2022 and seized dozens of classified and top secret documents. Trump and several of his associates were indicted in July 2023.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the federal bench when Donald Trump was president, had initially set the trial date for May 20. At a March 1 hearing, attorneys from special counsel Jack Smith's office urged Cannon not to delay the trial beyond that date. July. Trump's legal team wanted the trial to begin after the presidential election.\n\nIn a written order issued Tuesday evening, Judge Aileen Cannon said there were too many pretrial motions and classified matters that needed to be resolved and said a trial date could not be finalized. The trial is unlikely to begin before the November election.\n\nCannon filed a series of pretrial motions until July 22.\n\nA spokesperson for Special Counsel Jack Smith declined to comment to NPR's Ryan Lucas.\n\nSmith's other case against Donald Trump in federal court in Washington, D.C., regarding Trump's efforts to derail Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is on hold.

However, both the prosecution and defense acknowledged that this date would need to be postponed.Judge Cannon, appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, confirmed the trial would not start on May 20 but did not provide a new date. Instead, she scheduled pre-trial hearings to continue through July 22.\n\nTrump has entered a plea of not guilty to 40 federal counts, which accuse him of \"retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\" As the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him in the previous election, Trump faces significant challenges.\n\nSmith encounters substantial obstacles in getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon has yet to make rulings on several critical legal issues in the documents case and has indicated support for Trump's defense on some matters. Trump's lawyers had argued for a trial date after the election, but also suggested August 12 in response to Cannon's order to propose a timeline. Smith, on the other hand, proposed a July start date.\n\nRandall Eliason, a law professor at George Washington University and an expert in white-collar criminal cases, commented on the unprecedented situation, stating, \"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution. That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nIn addition to the federal cases, Trump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15, facing charges of unlawfully seeking to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in Georgia state court over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n(With inputs on agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

United States District Judge Aileen Cannon issued an order Tuesday afternoon, May 7, resetting the court calendar in the case. Cannon, a Trump appointee, had initially set trial commencement for May 20. The judge wrote that she would not set a new trial date until significant pretrial matters are decided, likely in late July. The ruling effectively pushes whatever new trial date is issued past Election Day, November 5.\n\nThe ruling is a massive defeat for the Biden/Garland Department of Justice's all-in effort to criminalize Donald Trump in advance of the presidential election. Would-be Trump-slayer Jack Smith - specially selected for that very purpose - petitioned Cannon in February for a trial date of July 8. Smith's proposal did not set forth a briefing schedule for all the many pretrial arguments, rulings, and requirements. Instead, he started with the July trial date and suggested the court work backward from there.\n\nJudge Cannon's ruling starts with what comes next; the pretrial business. She wrote:\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture - before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pretrial and CIPA [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues remaining and forthcoming - would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pretrial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nThe DOJ seemed particularly interested in fast-tracking the criminal charges against Trump. The former president argues the extraordinary charges are designed to hobble his chances of returning to the White House. Prosecutors recently admitted to Cannon, Trump, and other defendants that they didn't preserve the evidence boxes in the manner they represented to the court. They have mixed up some of the papers instead of maintaining the contents of boxes in the order in which they were seized in the raid on Mar-a-Lago. How to treat that issue is one of many Cannon will have to decide in the coming months.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan launched an investigation of Special Prosecutor Smith on May 6. He gave the DOJ a May 20 deadline to schedule a briefing and deliver documents regarding the ethical improprieties revealed in this case. Mr. Trump's counsel sent a letter to senior DOJ chiefs claiming prosecutors engaged in a \"pattern of inaccurate claims regarding the status and substance of discovery\" and that \"it is now clear that even the most fundamental premise of the criminal justice process does not apply in this case.\"\n\nLast month, Donald Trump posted a screed to social media about Jack Smith, calling him \"deranged\" and the classified documents case a \"FAKE Documents Hoax case in Florida.\"\n\nWith this case being pushed past Election Day, should the former president win another term, he will almost certainly direct the Department of Justice to drop the matter entirely. He could also choose to issue himself a pardon. Other cases against Trump are also racing against the clock. The election interference case - also led by Jack Smith - is on hold until the Supreme Court makes its ruling on presidential immunity. The Georgia case against Trump now seems likely to miss its proposed trial start date due to hearings over Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' affair with her lead prosecutor. As of now, the ongoing NYC-based prosecution of Trump for an alleged \"hush money\" payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels is the only case that seems likely to be decided before November.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_d_cosenza@libertynation.com", "name": "Scott D.

This decision means that there are currently no trial dates set for the other three criminal cases against Trump.\n\nThe indefinite postponement of the classified documents trial by Judge Cannon could potentially push it closer to the 2024 election or beyond, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe new schedule outlined by the judge details the legal disputes that must be resolved before the case can proceed to trial by jury. Judge Cannon stated that this process would take at least until late July of the current year.\n\nIn her order, Judge Cannon highlighted that there are eight substantive pending motions that she has yet to decide. She also acknowledged the complexity of the national security mishandling allegations in the case, describing them as \"novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nWhile all parties agreed that the case would not be ready for trial by May, prosecutors advocated for a trial date in July, whereas Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Trump's legal team has consistently argued in court filings that holding a trial before the election would be unfair.\n\nThe further delay in the trial could potentially result in Trump's two federal cases converging.\n\nIn Washington, DC, Trump faces charges related to alleged crimes committed during his presidency aimed at overturning the 2020 election results. This case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith's team, has been paused while the Supreme Court deliberates on Trump's claims of extensive immunity. A ruling from the Supreme Court is anticipated by July, according to CNN.\n\nIn the Florida case, Trump is accused of mishandling classified documents and obstructing the Justice Department's investigation in collaboration with co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. All three defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nJudge Cannon announced in her new scheduling order that she will conduct a hearing on Trump's request for records from the Biden administration, previously considered a longshot. The hearing is scheduled to begin on June 24 and is expected to last three days.\n\nThis decision by Judge Cannon represents a significant victory for Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The hearing will provide Trump and his legal team with an opportunity to present unfounded theories about the prosecution, including claims of political motivation.\n\nAttorneys representing special counsel Jack Smith have vehemently refuted allegations of political bias and opposed the decision to hold the hearing, considering it unnecessary and unjustified.\n\nAdditionally, Judge Cannon has scheduled a hearing for June 21 to address Trump's assertions that Smith's appointment was unlawful.\n\nTrump's request for records from the Biden administration is grounded in the argument that various federal agencies, including those within President Joe Biden's White House, are effectively part of the prosecution team.\n\nHowever, Smith's office has dismissed these claims as baseless and the discovery request as frivolous, asserting that the defence's arguments do not meet the required threshold for such a proceeding, CNN reported.

She scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nThe charges include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nMr Trump's lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an August 12 date in response to an order from the judge to propose a timeline for the case.\n\nThe prosecution proposed a July start date and has pushed aggressive deadlines, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial.\n\nProsecutor Jay Bratt told Judge Cannon that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the vote.\n\nJudge Cannon has denied two bids by Mr Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending.\n\nShe also has signalled that Mr Trump's claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Mr Trump to trial before the election.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Mr Smith involving Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognise that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions.\n\nThat outcome mostly likely would further delay Mr Trump's election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nMr Trump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nHe has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMr Trump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated and his lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\"We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases.\n\n\"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\"\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Mr Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before November 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Mr Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said lawyer Kel McClanahan, who specialises in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury.

He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.", "source": {"uri": "cbs12.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPEC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_magnoli@cbs12.com", "name": "Mike Magnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pierce,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax exemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cbs12.com/resources/media/d863e015-0dc2-46b0-986d-3623a6397caa-large16x9_AP24128759025927.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 346, "textEnd": 352}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

His weeks-long insistence that he hadn't lost and got to stay president meant that his team had less time to transition out of the building. He departed Jan. 20, taking boxes of souvenirs and documents with him to Florida. Other boxes went to a transition office in Virginia before being shipped to him at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe National Archives discovered that it was missing several records from his administration and sent a letter to Trump's attorneys asking that they be returned. This triggered what followed: Trump personally picking through the material (per federal prosecutors) to send boxes back to Washington, the discovery by the Archives that some material was marked as classified, and a probe that determined that he probably had more classified material. After his attorneys gave Justice Department officials a package of documents in June 2022, attesting that it was everything Trump had, further investigation revealed that this wasn't true. In August 2022, the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, finding more than 100 additional marked documents.\n\nThe indictment obtained by special counsel Jack Smith included other elements - an alleged attempt to hide security-camera footage, movement of boxes just before federal investigators came, discussion of classified material with uncleared individuals - but the case largely centers on the documents. Of the indictments Trump faces, the case in Florida was often regarded as the most clear-cut.\n\nAnd then it was assigned to Judge Aileen M. Cannon.\n\nBy the time a federal grand jury indicted Trump in June 2023, Cannon had already raised eyebrows for her handling of the Mar-a-Lago search. Cannon ordered that the material seized in the search be reviewed by a \"special master,\" a third party who could determine whether any material should be excluded from the investigation because it was covered by attorney-client privilege. And Cannon went further: Until the review was done, prosecutors couldn't use the material to move their investigation forward.\n\nThat stipulation was quickly reversed by an appeals court. A few months later, the same court dismissed the special master in highly critical terms.\n\n\"All these arguments\" offered by Trump's attorneys for the special master, the ruling stated, \"are a sideshow.\" Yet Cannon accepted them. Legal experts speaking to The Washington Post and New York Times presented significant skepticism about Cannon's actions.\n\nThe indictment was handed down. The random process of assigning it to a judge resulted in it landing, once again, in Cannon's lap.\n\nAs the government and Trump's team have jockeyed over pretrial motions and the determination of when the trial might begin, Cannon has repeatedly accommodated Trump's position.\n\nProsecutors pushed for a December 2022 trial start date. Trump wanted it to begin later - ostensibly because his legal team needed time to review evidence, but clearly, in part, because it wanted to push the trial past the presidential election. Cannon opted for May 2024 but hinted even in November that she might push it out further.\n\nTrump's team wanted to argue in its defense that Trump was authorized to identify any documents he wanted as personal records. This is clearly not the case, but Cannon in mid-March ordered both sides to draft jury instructions that treated the argument as viable.\n\nThen there was the debate over the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which covers the handling of classified material in criminal proceedings. Under Section 5 of CIPA, defendants have to inform the government about which documents they plan to use at trial. The deadline for doing so was originally set in mid-November.\n\nShortly before that deadline, Cannon pushed the deadline out, saying she would set a new one after hearings in early March. It wasn't until early April, as Lawfare's Roger Parloff has reported, that Cannon set a new deadline of May 9 - a bit before the June 17 date Trump's team wanted but nearly six months after the original deadline. The May 20 trial start date, already wobbly, was about to topple over.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, Cannon finally blew the whole thing apart. In a ruling outlining a new schedule, Cannon not only moved the Section 5 deadline to June 17 (as Trump's team had originally sought) but she also pulled the trial start date indefinitely. In part, she wrote, it was because of \"the myriad and interconnected pretrial and CIPA issues\" - presumably including the CIPA issues that had been left unresolved for a half-year.\n\nIn the new order, she offered another accommodation for Trump's team. In an April 22 filing, it argued that the \"prosecution team\" in this case should include \"Agencies And Attorneys That Participated In The Investigation,\" including, among others, the White House, National Archives and Secret Service. Should Cannon determine that to be the case, the special counsel's office \"has an affirmative obligation to collect and produce discoverable evidence in the possession of the entire prosecution team,\" the filing argued.\n\nSmith responded, arguing that the Trump team \"seeks non-discoverable materials based on speculative, unsupported, and false theories of political bias and animus.\" Looping in other parties, the filing read, relies on \"a pervasively false narrative of the investigation's origins.\"\n\nCannon's order Tuesday sets aside three days in late June specifically to consider this point.\n\nWhether the trial occurs before or after the election is likely to matter politically. There's no reason to think that a conviction of Trump on the Florida charges would result in a significant decline in his support. By kicking the trial out past the election, though, it does offer Trump a specific legal advantage: If he wins the presidency, he can delay or kill the prosecution entirely.\n\nTrump is obviously cognizant that the prosecution being managed by Cannon is going his way. He has repeatedly excoriated the judge in his Manhattan trial, for example, as well as the judge overseeing his civil fraud case. His supporters on Truth Social - the social media echo chamber he created after being booted off Twitter in January 2021 - have echoed his disparagements.\n\nCannon gets different treatment in Trumpworld, where her rulings are generally hailed as uniquely wise. She's been celebrated by adherents of the QAnon movement, given that a May 2018 post from the anonymous \"Q\" showed an image of a cannon titled \"justice.jpg.\" Trump has remained uncharacteristically mum.\n\nSome of Cannon's approach may be explained by inexperience. She has not been a judge for long. Her appointment (by Trump) came despite her having limited trial experience; she'd spent 14 days trying four criminal trials before being tapped for her current position. She also has reportedly seen two clerks resign in the past year.\n\nIf there were a judge who actively wanted to delay Trump's Florida trial, though, it's not clear what they might have done much differently.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philip_bump@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Philip Bump", "type": "author",

Smith's team added that the evidence may be in a different order as things shift easily when the boxes are carried.\n\nTrump, who has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal charges in relation to the classified documents case, accused Smith of \"blatant evidence tampering\" in the wake of the filings and called for him to be arrested.\n\nTrump Jr. has now expressed similar criticism of Smith while sharing a clip of his online show ,Triggered, featuring an interview with reporter Julie Kelly.\n\n\"So as it turns out, Jack Smith and his team tampered with evidence. Or to put it another way: Mishandled classified materials,\" Trump Jr. wrote. \"Whatever the left accuses everyone else of doing is exactly what they're doing themselves!!!\"\n\nDuring the clip he shared on social media, Trump Jr. also repeated the suggestion that the federal case against the presumptive Republican 2024 candidate is politically motivated.\n\n\"If this was Trump doing it to Biden or Obama before him [MSNBC host] Rachel Maddow would talk about this thing 24/7, 365 for 15 years,\" Trump Jr. said. \"It would be the only talking point of the left, they'd run elections around it ...it's not like it's one thing that's an error. It's just one after the other after the other and it's like, well, if they get away with one, then it's just a snowball effect.\"\n\nSmith's office has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nTrump Jr. made the remakes before Cannon pushed back the start of the classified documents trial indefinitely, increasing the likelihood the former president will not appear before a Florida jury before November's election.\n\nIn a court filing on Tuesday, Cannon said there are several other legal issues and deadlines that need to be resolved before she can confirm the start of the proceedings. The trial was originally set for May 20, but Cannon was long expected to postpone it beyond this date.\n\nInstead of confirming a new trial date, Cannon rescheduled a number of pretrial deadlines, including one related to the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) on July 22, meaning the trial will definitely not start before then.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_palmer@newsweek.com", "name": "Ewan Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Maddow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Maddow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_&_Imaging_Products_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camera & Imaging Products Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic_Wimpout", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic Wimpout", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389642/donald-trump-jr-south-carolina.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9a1ac0c289ac4281d1a869c9b6507184", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2419, "textEnd": 2425}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-22", "textStart": 2658, "textEnd": 2665}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The trial, originally set for May 20, has been delayed, significantly reducing the likelihood of Trump facing a jury in the two federal criminal cases against him before the upcoming November 5 US election. US District Judge Aileen Cannon, appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, announced the delay, stating that the trial would not commence on the previously scheduled date. Instead, pre-trial hearings are now slated to continue until July 22, with no new trial date set.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing U.S. government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nThe charges include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nProsecutor Jay Bratt told Judge Cannon that an autumn trial would not violate Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the vote.\n\nTrump is currently also on trial in a court in New York in connection with hush money payments to a porn actress. But this trial is not Trump's only legal problem.\n\nLast year, former President Trump found himself entangled in federal charges related to the mishandling of classified documents during his tenure from 2017 to 2021. The accusations point towards the unlawful possession of highly-sensitive information, prompting an intense legal battle.

It is possible that the documents trial, along with the two others, could be postponed until after their expected rematch in the November election.\n\nIf Trump were to beat Biden in that race, then as president he would be in a position to ask the Justice Department to drop all of the pending charges against him.\n\nCannon's procedural but significant ruling follows her decision in April rejecting Trump's bid to throw out the classified documents case, concluding that the Presidential Records Act \"does not provide a pre-trial basis to dismiss\" the 42-count indictment.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued at a hearing in March in the Fort Pierce federal courthouse that he designated the documents as his own personal property when he took them from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach after leaving office and therefore he had the authority to keep them.\n\nIn her three-page order, Cannon rejected the Trump legal team's reasoning, saying most of the counts in the indictment fall under the Espionage Act, which states that without authorization it is illegal to retain any national defense documents and fail to turn them over to the U.S. government. She noted that the indictment's 32 espionage charges make no reference to the Presidential Records Act.

He now has a chance to dodge it entirely.", "body": "By clicking \"Sign Up\", you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can opt-out at any time.\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal case over his holding onto secret government documents following his presidency delayed the trial indefinitely -- giving him the chance to get rid of the charges if he wins the 2024 election.\n\nIn an order Tuesday afternoon, US District Judge Aileen Cannon scheduled more than a dozen more hearings and deadlines for lawyers through July. The trial, she said, couldn't happen until she decided \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining,\" referring to laws related to handling classified information.\n\nCannon -- who Trump nominated for the judgeship while he was in the White House -- had previously scheduled jury selection to commence on May 20, but it had long been clear the trial would not be ready to take place by then.\n\nFor months, lawyers for Trump and his two co-defendants -- Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira and aide Waltine Nauta -- had been sparring with federal prosecutors over how to share discovery information, which includes classified documents.\n\nJustice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith, in an indictment last June, accused Trump of violating a slew of criminal national security and obstruction laws by spiriting away sensitive government documents from the White House to Mar-a-Lago and other personal properties, holding on to them after his presidency, and lying about it to authorities.\n\nThe co-defendants, de Oliveira and Nauta, each helped Trump hide the documents and mislead investigators, prosecutors alleged. (A PAC controlled by Trump is paying lawyers representing de Oliveira and Nauta with political donor funds.)\n\nIt's one of four ongoing criminal cases against Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2024 election and the only former president to be charged with any crime.\n\nTrump is currently about halfway through his first criminal trial, in Manhattan, where prosecutors accused Trump of illegally falsifying business records when he covered up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with him, ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nUnlike in civil cases -- Trump recently went through two -- criminal cases generally require that the defendant be present during the entire trial, making scheduling a complicated task.\n\nTrump may also have the power, if he were to be reelected president, to dispose of the cases brought by the Justice Department.\n\nAnother criminal case overseen by Smith, in a federal court in Washington, DC, was previously scheduled for March 4. In that case, Smith alleged Trump broke criminal laws through his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But it has been paused as the US Supreme Court weighs whether Trump would be immune from prosecution in the case, and may not be decided in time to complete the trial process before the 2024 election.\n\nTrump's attorneys have also made immunity arguments in the classified documents case.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis also brought election interference charges against Trump, for trying to overturn the results in Georgia. That case is not expected to go to trial until 2025 at the earliest.\n\nAt a hearing in February for the New York case, Juan Merchan, the presiding judge, grew impatient with Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, as he tried to lodge the trial from its original March 25 start date. Blanche is also the lead attorney representing Trump in the government documents case.\n\n\"Stop interrupting me, please,\" Merchan said, when Blanche said the Florida case might move forward in May. \"You don't have a trial date, not a real one.\"\n\nBlanche had suggested that everyone reconvene in March and then decide on a new schedule going forward. Merchan held firm, pointing out that the DC case had been indefinitely delayed, and that he expected the Manhattan trial to last six weeks -- meaning it would end even if Cannon had held onto her May start date.\n\n\"I'm sure that the trial cannot start on May 20th if this trial is ongoing May 20th and Mr. Trump is present in this courtroom on May 20th, which I don't expect,\" Merchan said. \"I expect this trial to last about six weeks. Even so, we can't have two simultaneous criminal trials.\"\n\nMerchan later pushed back the trial to April, based on a last-minute snafu related to the production of new records from a separate criminal investigation from federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stormy Daniels took the stand, testifying about sex she says she had with Trump in 2006 -- and threats she said she experienced later.\n\nTrump filed several motions to dismiss the Florida case in February, claiming he's immune from criminal charges and that it was OK for him to hold on to the records.\n\nCannon has thus far declined to dismiss the case on some of Trump's arguments, but is weighing others.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors":

The Washington Post reported in September of the same year that some materials related to US nuclear secrets, Iran's missile program, and Washington's intelligence activities in China.\n\nA year later, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami, Florida. The former president has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial was initially set to begin on May 20, 2024. However, in a ruling on Tuesday, US District Judge Aileen Cannon reset the date, arguing that there were eight substantive pending motions on which she has yet to decide. The judge also said she believed the national security mishandling allegations to \"present novel and difficult questions.\"\n\nCannon said that the finalization of a trial date at this point \"would be imprudent and inconsistent with the court's duty to fully and fairly consider\" numerous issues in the case, noting that \"additional pretrial and trial preparations [are] necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nTrump's legal team had previously argued that holding the trial close to the election, scheduled for November, could be tantamount to interference.\n\nGiven the new ruling, it is unclear whether the trial will start before the election, in which Trump is almost certain to face a rematch with US President Joe Biden. The Washington Post noted that, if the GOP frontrunner were to win, he could appoint an attorney general who would drop the federal charges against him. The Justice Department has a long-standing policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nTrump, who is the first former president in US history to face criminal charges, is also fighting several other legal battles.

Her decision is a boon to the former president and his legal team, which has pushed the judge repeatedly to delay the trial until after the presidential election in November.\n\nTrump, accused of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, has pleaded not guilty to the 40 charges against him. The classified documents case is one of four criminal trials in store for the former president, including one underway in New York concerning alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nWho is Aileen Cannon?

Now that it's off the calendar, the DC election interference case can proceed as soon as (or IF) the Supreme Court gives the green light.\"\n\nCannon's order does not hint at potential trial dates. Prosecutors have suggested it could begin in early July, while Trump's lawyers have argued it should start no earlier than August. The Republican National Convention is scheduled for July 15-18 in Milwaukee.\n\nThe judge has yet to rule on several outstanding motions, too, including numerous attempts to dismiss the case by Trump and his codefendants. In his latest, Trump invoked the names of political rivals who he says retained classified documents and received no more than a slap on the wrist.\n\nUnlike them, prosecutors say Trump engaged in a \"multifaceted scheme of deception and obstruction\" to thwart those documents' safe return.\n\nAttorneys representing the former president's employees and codefendants, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, argued in their own motions to dismiss the case that they had \"no clue\" what was in the boxes they moved around Mar-a-Lago at Trump's instruction.", "source": {"uri":

Carter", "body": "Breaking Tuesday, Former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in Florida, where he faces charges of mishandling classified documents, has been postponed indefinitely. The trial, initially scheduled for later this month, has been delayed as the judge orders a new pretrial schedule for motions and discovery. The trial's postponement likely means it will not take place before the 2024 presidential election in November.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, cited unresolved pretrial issues and critical concerns related to classified information as reasons for the delay. \"Finalization of a trial date at this juncture would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions,\" Cannon stated in her order.\n\nNational Review reports that the decision to delay the trial follows a recent admission by special counsel Jack Smith's team of prosecutors that evidence was rearranged after the FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in August 2022. This admission raised concerns, as the government had previously assured the court that the evidence remained intact.\n\nHouse Republicans have launched an investigation into the handling of evidence by Smith's team, particularly the shuffling of documents. Smith is prosecuting Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency concluded. The charges stem from Trump's refusal to hand over classified documents to the National Archives, as required by law.\n\nThe delay is the latest setback for Smith's efforts to bring Trump to trial. Smith is also prosecuting Trump in Washington, D.C., for his alleged role in the January 6th, 2021 Capitol riot.

She then issued another ruling delaying a trial indefinitely.\n\nTo set a trial date, Cannon wrote, \"would be imprudent and inconsistent\" with the court's need \"to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions,\" The Washington Post reported. An indefinite postponement, she continued, is consistent with Trump's \"right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nThe next scheduled conference in the case is set for July 22. That means there can be no trial before then - it was once scheduled to begin this month - and probably not before voters head to the polls. If Trump wins the presidential election, he could have his handpicked attorney general kill off the case altogether.\n\nBut if Cannon, a former federal prosecutor appointed in 2020, feels overwhelmed by the case and all the pre-trial motions she has yet to rule on, legal experts said she has only herself to blame. Brandon Von Grack, a former Justice Department lawyer who served on Bob Mueller's team, noted, for example, that it's \"highly unusual\" for a judge to hold three days of hearings on a defense motion aimed at defining the \"scope\" of the prosecution's legal team.\n\nCannon is also expected to further delay the case by entertaining a defense argument that Trump and his valet, Walter Nauta, are victims of \"prosecutorial misconduct and vindictive and selective prosecution,\" noted Lawfare senior editor Roger Parloff, who added that Cannon has \"already shown herself receptive to these themes.\"\n\nIndeed, as The New York Times' Alan Feuer wrote Tuesday, the delays are not merely a product of a complex case with an unusually high-profile defendant. \"Over and over,\" he commented, \"Judge Cannon ... has treated seriously arguments that many, if not most, federal judges would have rejected out of hand.\"\n\nEric Holder, who served as U.S. attorney general under former President Barack Obama, said Cannon's behavior has been downright \"disturbing,\" writing on social media that \"this whole process in the documents case has simply not been on the up and up.\"\n\nBut while liberal critics are quick to point out that Cannon is overseeing a case involving the man who gave her the job she has today, there is an alternative explanation for her behavior: she is also highly inexperienced. As Reuters previously reported, she made several elementary mistakes in a criminal trial she handled last year, such as apparently forgetting to swear in the prospective jury pool and barring the public from observing the selection process, forcing her to later restart the whole process.\n\nBut Ty Cobb, who served as legal counsel for the Trump White House before becoming a critic of the former president, told CNN there's no reason to choose between the two possible explanations for Cannon's handling of the classified documents case. Why not both?\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer?

Appearing on MSNBC, he said he had \"lost any hope of seeing this trial take place before November.\"\n\n\"This decision, and the handling of this case, start to finish, have been atrocious,\" Katyal said. \"This is not a hard case, it does not require the amount of delay that we've had. The case is pretty simple... a guy stole some documents, he hid them, when the government came and looked for them, he lied and hid them,\" he continued. \"That's it. It's not rocket science. And yet this judge has slow-walked this thing to death.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare_(blog)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare (blog)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutorial_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutorial misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ty Cobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/03/judge_aileen_cannon_donald_trump_2072040215.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-22", "textStart": 1050, "textEnd": 1057}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Cannon said there were eight outstanding substantive pending motions for her to rule on and predicted this will take until at least late July. She didn't set a new court trial date meaning it is unclear whether the case will get underway before the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump is facing 40 federal charges over claims he improperly held onto classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021 and then obstructed attempts to get them returned to the relevant authorities. He has pled not guilty and claimed the charges against him, along with those in three separate criminal trials, are politically motivated.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, a number of legal experts hit out at Cannon's decision.\n\nAsha Rangappa, a lawyer and former FBI agent with over 831,000 X followers, wrote: \"I think that Judge Cannon is intellectually out of her league and is having some weird analysis paralysis because her personal partisanship makes her place Trump's bizarre arguments (like that nuclear secrets are his personal records) on par with [special counsel Jack] Smith's *actual* legal arguments.\n\n\"She's afraid of making any mistake, lest Smith have a basis to appeal and perhaps get her removed, and so in this lost, ineffective, and paranoid state, the best she can hope for is that Trump gets elected and the case just goes away. So that's her play.\"\n\nJoyce Alene, a lawyer and former U.S. district attorney, commented: \"This is news but it's hardly unexpected. Judge Cannon seems desperate to avoid trying this case. This isn't justice. defendants aren't the only ones with speedy trial act rights, we the people have them too.\"\n\nIn another X post Robert Reich, a lawyer who served as U.S. Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton, claimed Trump will \"never face trial\" in the case if elected for a second White House term in November.\n\nHe wrote: \"Four facts: 1. If Trump stole nat'l secrets, he must face justice.\n\n\"2. Thanks to Judge Cannon, it now seems impossible for a trial to happen before the election. 3. If he's reelected, he will never face trial. 4. Therefore, Trump must be defeated as a matter of nat'l [national] security.\"\n\nAuthor and Daily Beast columnist David Rothkopf suggested Smith needed to \"remedy\" the \"problem\" he believes Cannon has become, in a possible hints at calls for the special counsel to try and get her removed from the case.\n\nHe commented: \"Justice delayed is justice denied. Both the defendant and the public have the right to a trial \"without unnecessary delay.\" (Sixth Amendment.) When does Jack Smith seek a remedy for the problem Judge Cannon clearly represents? Tick freaking tock.\"\n\nHowever, speaking to Newsweek in April, attorney Neama Rahmani, president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers law firm, said it is unlikely Cannon could be removed from the case.\n\n\"Cannon seems in over her head and not ready for a case of this magnitude. It's still unlikely that she will be removed from the case, however,\" he said.\n\n\"Being reversed on appeal isn't enough, even if she is reversed multiple times. Smith would have to prove Cannon is partial and reassignment is necessary.

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOutside of the trial date question, the classified documents case has yielded other revelations about Mr Trump's time since leaving office.\n\nIn documents unsealed this week, the former president's valet and co-defendant, Walt Nauta, described Mr Trump essentially choosing at random which documents to return to the National Archives as he wrapped up his presidential affairs.\n\n\"What I recall is every time he would leave for the evening, they would come up, and they would collect all the papers that he threw on the floor; or that - at the time - we understood that he didn't need any more,\" Mr Nauta told FBI agents investigating the case.\n\nThe decision from Judge Cannon means that the former president's ongoing hush money trial in New York may be the only one of the many legal battles facing Mr Trump that will play out before the 2024 election is complete.\n\nThe other case from special counsel Jack Smith against Mr Trump, which accuses the former president of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results, is currently on hold as the Supreme Court weighs whether Mr Trump is protected by presidential immunity.\n\nMeanwhile, in Georgia, a case accusing the former president and his associates of conspiring to interfere with the 2020 election results does not yet have a trial date, despite Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's stated goal of trying Mr Trump before the election.\n\nThe case there was derailed for weeks as courts considered the legal implications of a romantic relationship between Ms Willis and Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor who was involved in the Trump case and has since resigned.\n\nThe greatest immediate threat to Mr Trump is the New York case.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Juan Merchan found the former president in contempt of court and in violation of a trial-related gag order, fining Mr Trump $1,000 and threatening him with jail time if he continues to violate court orders around his public commentary on the case.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type":

She joined PEOPLE in 2023 and covers entertainment and human interest stories. Her previous work can be found in OK! Magazine, MyLondon, GRM Daily, and more.\n\nTwo of Donald Trump's criminal cases are facing new court delays, pushing the former president one step closer to escaping their long-awaited trials.\n\nOn May 7, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon revealed in a court filing that the federal classified documents trial in Florida -- which was scheduled to begin on May 20 -- would be postponed indefinitely due to multiple pretrial issues.\n\nIn the filing, Cannon -- who's been accused by critics of being partial to Trump -- wrote \"that finalization of a trial date at this juncture ... would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nShe added, \"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nPEOPLE previously reported in June 2023 that Trump had been charged with violating the Espionage Act after the Justice Department's investigation into how he handled classified documents after his presidential term.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, at least seven counts were included in the federal indictment, such as conspiring to obstruct justice, making false statements and willfully retaining national defense secrets in violation of the Espionage Act.\n\nThe trial was initially scheduled to take place in August 2023 before getting delayed.\n\nOn the heels of Cannon's decision in the Florida case, Trump secured another court victory -- this time in his Georgia election interference case.\n\nTrump previously tried to get the Fulton County district attorney disqualified from the case after it came to light that she had been in a relationship with one of her prosecutors. When the county judge allowed the DA to stick around, Trump appealed the decision.\n\nOn May 8, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to hear Trump's challenge, which will further delay the trial. In that case, he is charged with 13 felony counts including violating the Georgia RICO Act.\n\nTrump has been indicted on felony charges in four separate criminal cases.\n\nSince the charges were announced, the former president's strategy has been to prevent as many cases from going to trial as possible by delaying them past the November election. His plan has largely worked, and it appears that only one of the four indictments -- which has been nicknamed the Manhattan \"hush money\" case -- will result in a verdict this year.\n\nTrump's Manhattan case centers around 34 felony counts of falsified business records, as prosecutors aim to prove that he used unlawful means to sway the 2016 presidential election. If the former president is convicted on any of the counts, he faces up to four years in prison.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Legal experts and political strategists say it's the latest win the Trump-appointed judge has handed him. It's also the latest example of one of Trump's cases being delayed potentially in his favor.\n\nUS District Judge Aileen Cannon handed former President Donald Trump yet another legal win when she delayed his classified documents case indefinitely on Tuesday.\n\nCannon, who was appointed by Trump, had previously scheduled jury selection for the case to begin on May 20. However, in her Tuesday order, she scheduled more than a dozen additional hearings and deadlines for lawyers through July so that she could rule on \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues,\" referencing the Classified Information Procedures Act, before the trial could begin.\n\nTrump has been charged with 37 counts, including 31 alleged violations of the Espionage Act for \"willful retention of national defense information,\" related to his handling of classified documents taken to his Mar-a-Lago club after leaving office. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLegal experts and political strategists who spoke with Business Insider said the move wasn't a surprise since she has repeatedly sided with Trump on issues that have come up during the case's proceedings, throwing a wrench in special counsel Jack Smith's case. Smith's office declined to comment on the latest order.\n\n\"With Judge Canon reversing her own decision today, there is a high likelihood the case will get pushed out past the election,\" litigation and appeals attorney Katie Charleston, whose background in jury trials includes extensive experience reviewing government contracts and procedures, told BI.\n\nIf that's the case, and Trump is elected President again in November's presidential election, it's possible he could get rid of each of the cases brought by the Justice Department -- meaning he could dodge this trial entirely.\n\nIt's just the latest legal win for Trump in the classified documents case handed to him by Cannon. Previously, she ruled that a special master should review the classified documents seized by the FBI from Mar-A-Lago, though the decision was ultimately reversed in a blistering opinion by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCannon has also previously denied the special counsel's request to hide the names of potential witnesses in the case, though legal experts earlier this year told BI that decision would also probably be overturned on appeal. Last month, Cannon agreed to the prosecutor's request to redact witness names, per the Associated Press, though she refused to prevent witness statements from being disclosed in pretrial motions.\n\nCNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid pointed out that Cannon's critics have questioned whether her favorable rulings to Trump are due to bias, inexperience, or \"analysis paralysis.\" The US District Court of Southern Florida did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Judge Cannon has ruled in Trump's favor at almost every possible turn, so I'm not surprised that she delayed the trial indefinitely,\" Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told BI following the latest trial delay. \"She is inexperienced and seems in over her head. She's made a number of bizarre rulings that aren't supported by logic or the law, and she has already been overturned by the 11th Circuit multiple times.\"\n\nRahmani added that the delay is a significant benefit to the former president, \"especially in the middle of another trial and the presidential campaign,\" making this ruling \"yet another win for Trump in South Florida.\"\n\nTy Cobb, a former Trump White House attorney, told CNN on Tuesday that Cannon's latest decision was \"a combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\n\"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" he said.\n\nOn the political front, Cannon's decision galvanizes Trump's allies, according to Charlie Kolean, the chief strategist at RED PAC, which supports Republican candidates, including Trump. Kolean told BI that to his supporters, the decision \"proves Trump's point\" that the prosecution is \"a political witch hunt,\" indicating that Trump's supporters generally see the ruling as evidence that the law is on Trump's side.\n\nWhile many legal experts have suggested that Cannon has offered Trump favorable treatment throughout the proceedings, the confidential information at hand in the case does require careful consideration, which means such delays are to be expected, according to attorney and legal analyst Tre Lovell.\n\nBut regardless of her intention, it's still a win for Trump, whose legal strategy in his four criminal cases is \"delay, delay, delay,\" according to Doron Kalir, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.\n\nIt's just the latest example of one of Trump's trials getting delayed. The January 6 trial is on hold while the Supreme Court decides on presidential immunity, and the Georgia case was delayed due to allegations of a romantic relationship between DA Fani Willis and lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nTrump's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn light of Cannon's latest delay, Kalir said it was not surprising given her prior actions on the case.\n\nHe also noted that Trump's lawyers have succeeded in delaying three of the four cases against him -- the exception being the hush-money case which is currently at trial in New York -- calling it \"quite an impressive record!\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business

Judges have extremely broad discretion over their trial calendar, which is what gives Judge Cannon the ability to avoid setting a trial date at this time,\" Mr. Mariotti wrote on social media.\n\nAnother former federal prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, wrote that Mr. Smith's team will have \"a bumpy ride\" ahead of them because of Judge Cannon's \"numerous other scheduled hearings on pretrial motions\" from President Trump and two co-defendants, which he indicates that Judge Cannon believes \"have merit.\"\n\nHarry P. Litman, a law professor and a former U.S. attorney, echoed those claims, saying that the case is now in a \"deep freeze\" after the latest order.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple television legal analysts claimed that with her latest order, Judge Cannon is intentionally trying to delay the case. The Epoch Times contacted the court for comment.\n\n\"This is news but it's hardly unexpected. Judge Cannon seems desperate to avoid trying this case. This isn't justice. defendants aren't the only ones with speedy trial act rights, we the people have them too,\" wrote former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance, who currently works for MSNBC, on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut Tim Fitton, the head of the Judicial Watch legal group, wrote that complaints about Judge Cannon's decisions are unwarranted, arguing that such a timeline \"is normal and not surprising.\"\n\n\"But the Left's election riggers and civil rights abusers believe that Trump has no rights and will attack Judge Cannon for proceeding normally in this case and for not violating Trump's constitutional rights,\" he wrote on X, formerly known Twitter.\n\nIn that post, he pointed out that Mr. Smith's team last week submitted court papers to Judge Cannon essentially saying that his team misled the court because the contents of a box of documents were re-arranged. Prosecutors did not disclose the exact reason why the materials may have been shifted.\n\n\"There are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,\" Mr. Smith's team wrote, adding that the update contrasts with what they told the judge several weeks ago during a hearing.\n\nThe boxes in question have \"items smaller than standard paper such as index cards, books, and stationary, which shift easily when the boxes are carried, especially because many of the boxes are not full,\" they added.\n\nAfter the disclosure, President Trump wrote his Truth Social platform that he believes Mr. Smith should be arrested before calling for the case to be immediately dropped.\n\nJudge Cannon has denied two bids by President Trump to dismiss the charges. She has signaled that President Trump's arguments that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.\n\nIn the meantime, there has been speculation that the classified documents case will not go to trial before the 2024 election. If it does, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from President Trump's legal team.\n\n\"Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\" said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nA Trump win in November could mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, President Trump could direct the Department of Justice to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nPresident Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 charges connected to allegations that he illegally retained classified documents at his home after leaving in January 2021 and obstructed officials' attempts to retrieve them. Two of his aides, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, have also been charged in the case.\n\nHe also faces charges in New York, where a trial is currently ongoing in which he is accused of falsifying business records during the 2016 election. Election interference charges were also filed in Fulton County, Georgia, and Washington.\n\nHe's pleaded not guilty to those charges, too, arguing they're part of an orchestrated plot to imperil his 2024 reelection chances.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)",

A new briefing is scheduled for July 22. In an order issued Tuesday, Judge Cannon said setting a new trial date at this time \"would be imprudent and inconsistent with the court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the court.\"\n\nThis is a victory for Donald Trump. Currently, he's on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records over an NDA agreement with prostitute and aging porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThere is also no news about the DC or the Georgia cases. It's all going to be up to Judge Merchan to put Donald Trump in jail or at least humiliate him so he loses votes in November.\n\nJudge Cannon said that the interest of the court outweighs any need to rush the Florida trial.\n\nIf Trump wins in November, he could have this case dismissed.

Cannon's decisions on pivotal legal matters in the documents case are pending, with indications of leaning towards Trump's defense on certain fronts.\n\nIn a separate case concerning Trump's endeavors to overturn the 2020 election results, the U.S. Supreme Court appears inclined to grant some level of immunity to former presidents regarding official actions, potentially prolonging Trump's election-related case as lower courts navigate the scope of this legal protection.\n\nTrump's legal team had proposed an August 12 date for the documents case trial, responding to Cannon's directive to outline a timeline. Smith suggested a July commencement.\n\nTrump's lawyers have consistently pursued postponements in all four criminal cases against him, prompting legal scholars to raise concerns about the unprecedented prospect of a defendant influencing the course of their own prosecution.\n\nTrump currently faces trial in New York state court over allegations of concealing hush money payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, alongside charges in Georgia for his role in disputing the 2020 election outcome.\n\nTrump has characterized all legal proceedings against him as politically motivated maneuvers.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case encompass violations of the Espionage Act, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and providing false statements to investigators.\n\nAccording to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, a significant portion of Republican respondents and a majority of independents indicated they would not support Trump if convicted of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case proceeds to trial before the election, it would likely occur shortly before November 5, potentially triggering accusations of election meddling from Trump's legal team.\n\nAttorney Kel McClanahan, specializing in national security issues, highlighted the judicial caution surrounding trying a presidential candidate in the weeks leading up to an election.\n\nHowever, a Trump victory in November could prevent either case from reaching trial, with the possibility of him directing the Justice Department to drop charges or issuing a self-pardon.\n\nSmith's legal team has been assertive in pushing for swift trial proceedings, arguing for the public's right to a prompt trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt assured Cannon that an autumn trial would not breach Justice Department guidelines regarding election impact.\n\nCannon has rejected two dismissal attempts by Trump but has several unresolved matters pending. She has also indicated that Trump's claim of the documents being personal records could influence future jury instructions, potentially leading to appeals and further delays.", "source": {"uri":

The judge, a Trump appointee, said it would be \"imprudent\" to set a trial date now considering the number of issues she's left unresolved.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" the order said. \"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nWhile conservatives cheered Cannon's ruling, framing the hearings on the scope of the prosecution and Trump's selective prosecution claims as a near \"extended mini-trial\" of Jack Smith (see also: defense's evidence mishandling allegations and certain prosecutorial admissions), lawyers on X, MSNBC, and CNN severely criticized Cannon, several of them directly bashing the judge's intelligence.\n\nThough at least one reporter who's been in Cannon's courtroom has since advised against \"psycho-analyzing\" the judge, former FBI special agent and legal commentator Asha Rangappa concluded that the jurist is \"intellectually out of her league\" and is operating in \"paranoid state\" given the special counsel's prior threat to appeal.\n\n\"I think that Judge Cannon is intellectually out of her league and is having some weird analysis paralysis because her personal partisanship makes her place Trump's bizarre arguments (like that nuclear secrets are his personal records) on par with Smith's *actual* legal arguments,\" Rangappa said on X. \"She's afraid of making any mistake, lest Smith have a basis to appeal and perhaps get her removed, and so in this lost, ineffective, and paranoid state, the best she can hope for is that Trump gets elected and the case just goes away. So that's her play.\"\n\nTy Cobb, Trump's former White House lawyer during the Mueller probe, was already on record with full-throated criticisms of Cannon's decision-making as legally \"embarrassing.\" He went a step beyond on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"All she's really done today is make official what everybody, including Jack Smith, already knew which was: She had no intention of getting this case to trial and she wasn't competent to get this case to trial,\" Cobb said. \"She talks about her duty to fully and fairly consider the pending motions. She's had months to do that and did very little. She's ruled on only three of the 12 motions to dismiss -- all of which could have been easily resolved by now.\"\n\nThen came the sharpest criticisms.\n\n\"This is something that, I think it was always her objective frankly to prevent this from going to trial, but also I think her inability -- wholesale inability -- to do it was made palpable,\" he said, chalking up the decision to a \"combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\nCobb said that the hearing on the scope of the prosecution team would not have been set by any other judge.\n\n\"[T]hat's a frivolous motion, no other judge would actually have a hearing on that. But she has scheduled one,\" he said, describing the judge's moves as \"really inexplicable\" and \"tragic\" for the country.\n\n\"She has not honored the public's interest for one day in this case, as she has sat in her office apparently paralyzed from ruling on easily resolvable motions. And sadly, this case will not go to trial -- notwithstanding the fact that it's one of the most important cases in history and could have easily been tried in advance of the election,\" Cobb continued.\n\nIn parting shots, Cobb stated that Cannon is \"not capable of ruling intelligently or fairly on most of the motions that will be pending and certainly classified information issues.\" He predicted that Cannon will be removed from the case before trial but acknowledged her latest order would not plausibly form the basis of such an effort.\n\nAt least one other figure from the Mueller investigation era also appeared to be perplexed by Cannon's \"struggling with the merits\" of the Espionage Act case.\n\n\"Really worth noting that the Court has actually seen all of the highly classified docs at issue that were not returned to Archives and DOJ -- and still appears to be struggling with the merits of the case,\" commented former Mueller probe prosecutor Brandon Van Grack.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor and legal analyst Renato Mariotti, for one, agreed with Cobb there's \"nothing\" Jack Smith can do to speed up the court calendar.\n\n\"Realistically there is nothing Jack Smith can do to move the Mar-a-Lago case forward to trial before the election. Judges have extremely broad discretion over their trial calendar, which is what gives Judge Cannon the ability to avoid setting a trial date at this time,\" Mariotti said on x.\n\nEven so, other criticisms blamed Cannon for \"literally\" engineering the trial delay herself by not resolving pending motions.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat in Connecticut and lawyer, chimed in Wednesday by calling Cannon's rulings \"aberrant\" and \"erratic\" enough to hasten her exit from the case.\n\n\"The kind of aberrant & erratic decisions made by this judge raise serious questions about whether she should be sitting on a case.. that's so highly challenging,\" Blumenthal said, according to CBS News' Scott MacFarlane.\n\nAlong similar lines, during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Wednesday, legal correspondent Lisa Rubin attributed the decisions Cannon has and hasn't made to her being in over her head and to \"anxiety.\"\n\n\"This is a judge who is overwhelmed and is second guessing herself at every corner. She seems to be overwhelmed with anxiety about the import of the case. And so, a combination of insecurity in your own decisions, the gravity of the case before you, and maybe also some inclination to slow-walk where you don't have trust in yourself, that's a toxic brew and, you know, we are all drinking it right now,\" Rubin said.\n\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen, the former Obama administration ethics czar, ultimately predicted, like Cobb, that the end result will be: No Mar-a-Lago trial start this year. If that happens and if Trump wins the 2024 election, the federal case disappearing is viewed as a fait accompli.\n\n\"It's an atrocious decision. It's the latest in a series of blunders dating back to her interfering with the investigation of these classified documents alleged mishandling before the indictment was even brought,\" Eisen said in one CNN segment. \"And she was severely criticized by extremely conservative judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals twice for her behavior there. But unfortunately, there's very little that can be done about it at this stage. It is a miscarriage of justice nevertheless.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

When the county judge allowed the DA to stick around, Trump appealed the decision.\n\nRelated: DA Fani Willis Can Stay on Trump's Election Interference Case Under One Condition, Georgia Judge Rules\n\nOn May 8, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to hear Trump's challenge, which will further delay the trial. In that case, he is charged with 13 felony counts including violating the Georgia RICO Act.\n\nRelated: N.Y.C. Mayor Eric Adams Says Rikers Island Will 'Be Ready' if Donald Trump Gets Jail Time over Gag Order\n\nTrump has been indicted on felony charges in four separate criminal cases.\n\nSince the charges were announced, the former president's strategy has been to prevent as many cases from going to trial as possible by delaying them past the November election. His plan has largely worked, and it appears that only one of the four indictments -- which has been nicknamed the Manhattan \"hush money\" case -- will result in a verdict this year.\n\nTrump's Manhattan case centers around 34 felony counts of falsified business records, as prosecutors aim to prove that he used unlawful means to sway the 2016 presidential election. If the former president is convicted on any of the counts, he faces up to four years in prison.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

It was supposed to start in just a couple weeks, on May 20. But alas, there are all these pretrial motions and questions to be resolved -- most of them originated by Cannon -- and they therefore couldn't possibly get started any time soon.\n\nWhen is the new trial date? Ha ha, Aileen Cannon will get back to you on that one when she's good and ready, or never.\n\nProbably best to wait until after the election, at which point (Cannon obviously hopes) Trump will be president again and she doesn't have to pretend to be a real judge anymore and maybe he will appoint her to something else fun, like Supreme Court Justice Of Doing Whatever Donald Trump Says.\n\nCan Jack Smith indict this partisan hack judge for obstruction of justice? We are just asking a fantastical, unserious layman's question. You know, because we are literally dealing here with a case about a former president indicted for willfully stealing and retaining America's closely guarded secrets, and we don't really know yet exactly why. Perhaps so he could sell/trade them to America's enemies AKA his friends, in exchange for Doing Him A Favor, Though?\n\nWith Trump, it's best to assume the worst, most treasonous possibility and work backward from there.\n\nIn Mar-a-Lago Mildred's latest ruling, she writes that on top of the pretrial motions she hasn't ruled on yet -- like motions to dismiss the case because Trump's bitch ass is screaming that Special Counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed -- there are all these confusing questions to be resolved about the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), and as we've all seen, Mar-a-Lago Mildred gets confused extremely easily, because she's not really qualified for the job she holds.\n\nOr at least she understands she's supposed to pretend she's dumb, while running out the clock for su jefe.\n\n\"The Court [...] determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nShe knows her role, and it isn't the oath she swore to uphold.\n\nAlterNet collected some reactions from your favorite analysts on Legal Twitter. Here are a couple:\n\n\"This is news but it's hardly unexpected,\" declared professor of law, former U.S. Attorney, and MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance wrote. \"Judge Cannon seems desperate to avoid trying this case. This isn't justice. defendants aren't the only ones with speedy trial act rights, we the people have them too.\" [...]\n\nForeign policy, national security, and political affairs analyst David Rothkopf added, \"Justice delayed is justice denied. Both the defendant and the public have the right to a trial 'without unnecessary delay.' (Sixth Amendment.) When does Jack Smith seek a remedy for the problem Judge Cannon clearly represents? Tick freaking tock.\"\n\nAnd this, from Asha Rangappa, really captures what a completely out-of-her-league dipshit Aileen Cannon is:\n\n\"I think that Judge Cannon is intellectually out of her league and is having some weird analysis paralysis because her personal partisanship makes her place Trump's bizarre arguments (like that nuclear secrets are his personal records) on par with Smith's *actual* legal arguments. She's afraid of making any mistake, lest Smith have a basis to appeal and perhaps get her removed, and so in this lost, ineffective, and paranoid state, the best she can hope for is that Trump gets elected and the case just goes away. So that's her play.\"\n\n\"Analysis paralysis.\" That's lovely.\n\nFar be it from Wonkette to tell Jack Smith how to do his job -- he doesn't come to our work and slap the dick jokes out of our mouth -- but at this point, with Trump's illegitimate partisan hack Supreme Court set to give him a sloppy rimjob in the election-stealing case and Cannon doing whatever the hell she's doing here, we'd be thinking about activating any \"break glass in case of emergency\" scenarios we might have right about now.\n\nI have profiles those other places but I think I forgot how to log on.", "source":

He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nTrump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the New York prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election.\n\nThe Supreme Court is weighing Trump's arguments that he is immune from federal prosecution in a separate case from special counsel Jack Smith charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia have also brought a separate case related to election subversion, though it's not clear when that might reach trial.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And the question of when -- or even whether -- the charges against Trump will go before a jury will now largely hinge on how Cannon handles an array of pretrial matters in the next few months, issues that many legal experts have said she could dispense with much more quickly.\n\nCannon, who was appointed by Trump in his final days in office, has been on the bench for only four years. She has limited experience overseeing trials of any kind -- let alone one involving explosive allegations that a former president and current candidate illegally took highly classified state secrets from the White House after he left office and then obstructed the government's repeated efforts to retrieve them.\n\nFor months now, she has stood in the glare of the spotlight with each of her most minute decisions scrutinized by an often critical gallery of legal scholars and reporters.\n\nNancy Gertner, a former federal judge who was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, said that rookie jurists handling prominent matters deserve some measure of leeway. But she added that Cannon had put herself outside the normal boundaries with her languid pace and her willingness to grant a sober audience to several of Trump's \"meshuggeneh motions.\"\n\n\"For a new judge in a big case, she could just be being careful, but the length of time all of this has taken and things she is allowing seems way beyond that,\" Gertner said. \"She is treating everything the defense has done as if they all raise substantial and important issues, and that's just not true.\"\n\nThroughout the case, Cannon has shown herself willing to devote significant time to hearing legal motions in person that many federal judges would likely have rejected out of hand or at least decided more quickly on the merits of written filings.\n\nIn April, for example, she conducted a hearing to consider giving Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, what is known as a bill of particulars, a detailed recitation of the charges in the case supplementing those laid out in the indictment.\n\nSuch documents are almost never granted to criminal defendants. And while Cannon ultimately denied the requests, her decision to open her courtroom to the issue in the first place was unusual.\n\nEven more unusual, perhaps, was a separate decision, contained in her new scheduling order, to set a hearing in late June to decide what is known as the scope of the prosecution team working under Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to oversee the federal prosecutions of Trump.\n\nProsecutors vehemently fought the move in March, telling Cannon that no such proceeding had ever been held in the Southern District of Florida where she sits and that there was neither case law nor any other legal authority to permit it.\n\nBut the hearing will now take place over the course of three full days. Her decision to hold it means Trump's lawyers will presumably be able to explore a twisted question of the law: whether they are entitled to learn more from prosecutors about how they went about pulling together the evidence turned over to the defense team as part of the discovery process.\n\nThat issue began percolating four months ago, when Trump's lawyers told Cannon in court papers that they needed more discovery. They asked specifically for information about how Smith may have worked with officials at the National Archives and with a vast swath of the U.S. national security establishment -- including top intelligence, defense and Justice Department personnel -- in bringing the case against Trump.\n\nThe lawyers want that information to bolster their claims that Smith worked hand in glove with the White House and other officials to prosecute Trump. And if Cannon tells them they can have it, the case will be further delayed as prosecutors make their way through various federal agencies to collect it and turn it over to the defense.\n\nMore delays are likely to emerge from another of Cannon's decisions this week: to postpone until mid-June the deadline for Trump's lawyers to submit a critical filing detailing an inventory of the classified materials they intend to use at trial.\n\nThe filing of that inventory is enormously important because it will begin a pitched and probably lengthy battle between the defense and prosecution over what sorts of classified materials the jury and the public will ultimately hear about.\n\nSmith's team had originally asked Cannon to force the defense to submit the classified filing by mid-March. Trump's lawyers, on the other hand, had initially pushed for June 17.\n\nAppearing to split the difference last month, Cannon set the deadline for May 9. But after last-minute pleas by Trump and Nauta to postpone it, she abruptly changed her mind Tuesday and granted the defense's original request.\n\n\"The way this is playing out makes it extraordinarily unlikely that there will be a trial before November,\" said Brian Greer, a former lawyer for the CIA who specializes in issues involving classified material.\n\nGreer, who has followed the case closely, noted that Cannon's new date for the briefing was actually the second time she had changed the deadline, which had initially been set for November.\n\nHe also pointed out that the judge's new calendar did not include all of the necessary filings concerning classified documents. The government will still have to file its own set of papers about what sorts of sensitive materials should be revealed at trial -- a process that, of course, will take more time.\n\nComplicating matters even further, Cannon's calendar said nothing at all about the deadlines to consider -- let alone decide -- some of Trump's most difficult and potentially consequential motions. Two of those motions have been under seal for more than two months and have not even been placed on the public docket yet.\n\nOne of the sealed motions revolves around undisclosed claims by Trump that members of Smith's team engaged in prosecutorial misconduct -- an accusation that is sure to be hotly contested by the government.\n\nThe other sealed motion -- also likely to result in a long fight -- has challenged the legality of the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club and residence in Florida. It also disputes the way in which the government pierced the normal protections of attorney-client privilege and obtained the audio notes of one of Trump's former lawyers, M. Evan Corcoran.\n\nBeyond all of that, there are more tough issues looming, which could add further layers of complexity and delay.\n\nJust this week, for instance, Trump's lawyers said they might soon file a motion accusing prosecutors of failing to preserve the integrity of the classified documents at the heart of the case. But it remains unclear, if the motion is filed, how seriously Cannon would actually take it.\n\nGreer said that Cannon's record in the case suggests she has been open to whatever the defense has chosen to send her.\n\n\"Certainly, her proclivity so far,\" he said, \"has been to listen to almost anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

On Friday, Smith's team admitted to misleading Cannon and tampering with the evidence that had been used as the basis for his case against Trump.\n\nLast month, Cannon unsealed a trove of new documents in the case that also revealed that an FBI agent had testified that the General Services Administration (GSA) was in possession of Trump's boxes in Virginia before ordering Trump's team to come get them. The same boxes that the GSA had been holding and ordered Trump's team to retrieve ended up being the boxes that contained classified markings, raising questions about whether the Biden administration had set up Trump.\n\n\"So an entire pallet full of boxes that had been held by GSA somewhere outside of DC is dumped at Mar-a-Lago,\" independent journalist Julie Kelly noted. \"Apparently these are the boxes that ended up containing papers with 'classified markings.'\"\n\nThe Supreme Court also heard oral arguments over Trump's claims to presidential immunity, which may affect this cause.\n\nRelated: Jack Smith's Case Against Trump Appears to Be Falling Apart\n\nCannon's decision is a major win for President Trump, who has repeatedly sought to delay the case until after the presidential election in November. In early April, Cannon rejected Trump's previous attempt to dismiss the case, which he based on the argument that the documents found at his estate were personal records. Trump had filed multiple motions for dismissal back in February, employing various arguments, such as asserting presidential immunity and questioning the legitimacy of Smith's appointment.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden had classified information that he was never entitled to have stored in boxes in his garage for years but was not charged. In February Special Counsel Robert Hur's report concluded that Biden \"willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen\" and that his actions \"present[ed] serious risks to national security.\" However, Hur wouldn't bring charges against him because Biden \"would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nBecause of this, Hur concluded it would be \"difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him [...] of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.\" Hur found that Biden's memory was \"significantly limited, both during his recorded interviews with the ghostwriter in 2017 and in his interview with our office in 2023\" and that he couldn't remember the years he was vice president or when his son Beau died.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Services_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Services Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

"body": "Donald Trump's classified documents trial has been delayed indefinitely, a judge ruled on Tuesday, making it unlikely the former president will be tried before the 2024 election.\n\nIn a win for the former US president, district judge Aileen Cannon axed the 20 May start date without scheduling a new timeline.\n\nMr Trump had been scheduled to go to trial in less than two weeks for the case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, but the prosecution and defense had both acknowledged that date would need to be delayed.\n\nIt comes as Mr Trump is currently in court in New York for his hush money case, in which he is accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nMs Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge, said to finalise the date before resolving a \"myriad\" of pre-trial issues would be \"imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty\".\n\nShe scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nThe postponement means Mr Trump is unlikely to face any of his further three criminal trials before voters go to the polls in November.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nMs Cannon is yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signaled support for Mr Trump's defence on some matters.\n\nThe charges include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nMr Smith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Mr Trump to trial before the election.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Mr Smith involving Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the results of 2020 election, the US Supreme Court appears poised to recognise that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions.\n\nThat outcome would likely further delay the case, which is being overseen by Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nMr Trump has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe latest delay is victory for Mr Trump, whose lawyers have worked to try and push his criminal cases back in the hope he wins the 2024 election.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Mr Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nMr Trump has denied all the charges against him, claiming he is the victim of a political witch hunt.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_coen@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Susie

However, in her Tuesday order, she scheduled more than a dozen additional hearings and deadlines for lawyers through July so that she could rule on \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues,\" referencing the Classified Information Procedures Act, before the trial could begin.\n\nTrump has been charged with 37 counts, including 31 alleged violations of the Espionage Act for \"willful retention of national defense information,\" related to his handling of classified documents taken to his Mar-a-Lago club after leaving office. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLegal experts and political strategists who spoke with Business Insider said the move wasn't a surprise since she has repeatedly sided with Trump on issues that have come up during the case's proceedings, throwing a wrench in special counsel Jack Smith's case. Smith's office declined to comment on the latest order.\n\n\"With Judge Canon reversing her own decision today, there is a high likelihood the case will get pushed out past the election,\" litigation and appeals attorney Katie Charleston, whose background in jury trials includes extensive experience reviewing government contracts and procedures, told BI.\n\nIf that's the case, and Trump is elected President again in November's presidential election, it's possible he could get rid of each of the cases brought by the Justice Department -- meaning he could dodge this trial entirely.\n\nIt's just the latest legal win for Trump in the classified documents case handed to him by Cannon. Previously, she ruled that a special master should review the classified documents seized by the FBI from Mar-A-Lago, though the decision was ultimately reversed in a blistering opinion by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCannon has also previously denied the special counsel's request to hide the names of potential witnesses in the case, though legal experts earlier this year told BI that decision would also probably be overturned on appeal. Last month, Cannon agreed to the prosecutor's request to redact witness names, per the Associated Press, though she refused to prevent witness statements from being disclosed in pretrial motions.\n\nCNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid pointed out that Cannon's critics have questioned whether her favorable rulings to Trump are due to bias, inexperience, or \"analysis paralysis.\" The US District Court of Southern Florida did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Judge Cannon has ruled in Trump's favor at almost every possible turn, so I'm not surprised that she delayed the trial indefinitely,\" Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told BI following the latest trial delay. \"She is inexperienced and seems in over her head. She's made a number of bizarre rulings that aren't supported by logic or the law, and she has already been overturned by the 11th Circuit multiple times.\"\n\nRahmani added that the delay is a significant benefit to the former president, \"especially in the middle of another trial and the presidential campaign,\" making this ruling \"yet another win for Trump in South Florida.\"\n\nTy Cobb, a former Trump White House attorney, told CNN on Tuesday that Cannon's latest decision was \"a combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\n\"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" he said.\n\nOn the political front, Cannon's decision galvanizes Trump's allies, according to Charlie Kolean, the chief strategist at RED PAC, which supports Republican candidates, including Trump. Kolean told BI that to his supporters, the decision \"proves Trump's point\" that the prosecution is \"a political witch hunt,\" indicating that Trump's supporters generally see the ruling as evidence that the law is on Trump's side.\n\nWhile many legal experts have suggested that Cannon has offered Trump favorable treatment throughout the proceedings, the confidential information at hand in the case does require careful consideration, which means such delays are to be expected, according to attorney and legal analyst Tre Lovell.\n\nBut regardless of her intention, it's still a win for Trump, whose legal strategy in his four criminal cases is \"delay, delay, delay,\" according to Doron Kalir, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.\n\nIt's just the latest example of one of Trump's trials getting delayed. The January 6 trial is on hold while the Supreme Court decides on presidential immunity, and the Georgia case was delayed due to allegations of a romantic relationship between DA Fani Willis and lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nTrump's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn light of Cannon's latest delay, Kalir said it was not surprising given her prior actions on the case.\n\nHe also noted that Trump's lawyers have succeeded in delaying three of the four cases against him -- the exception being the hush-money case which is currently at trial in New York -- calling it \"quite an impressive record!\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cannon said there were eight outstanding substantive pending motions for her to rule on and predicted this will take until at least late July.\n\nIt is unknown whether the case will begin before the November 2024 presidential election. If elected, Trump has a number of options to kill the trial, including pardoning himself or appointing a favorable attorney general to drop the charges.\n\nCannon is overseeing the case in which the former president is accused of illegally retaining classified documents, hoarding them at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and obstructing attempts by federal officials to retrieve them.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential election, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.

She's made a number of bizarre rulings that aren't supported by logic or the law and she has already been overturned by the Eleventh Circuit multiple times.\"\n\nRahmani, president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers law firm in California, said that delays benefit the former president, \"especially in the middle of another trial and the presidential campaign.\"\n\nHe said Cannon's ruling \"is yet another win for Trump in south Florida.\"\n\nNew York University law professor Stephen Gillers told Newsweek that Cannon was never going to put Trump on trial before election day.\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" he said. \"You don't have to be a mind reader to predict that a trial before Election Day was never going to happen. Her slow pretrial pace made it rather clear that she was in no hurry to bring the case to trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com", "name": "Sean O'Driscoll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norm Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brookings Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gillers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Gillers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389539/florida-judge-aileen-cannon.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9c8cd1b6f3b5772b6094e0f58b9eb3e5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Jack Smith, the special counsel, had charged Trump with thirty-two counts under the Espionage Act, for allegedly hoarding national-security documents at Mar-a-Lago, and with another eight counts involving obstruction and false statements. The trial had tentatively been set for May 20th. Now, following Judge Cannon's order, the prosecutors will have to hope for an update at a \"status conference\" hearing on July 22nd -- which, as it happens, is four days after the Republican National Convention, where Trump will almost certainly get his party's formal Presidential nomination, wraps up in Milwaukee. Cannon, in her order, said in effect that the whole business of the case has become much too complicated to proceed sooner. Unfortunately, for many reasons -- not all of them under Cannon's control -- that may, indeed, be true.\n\nThere were, Cannon said, \"myriad and interconnected\" unresolved issues and \"novel and difficult questions,\" which made it \"imprudent\" to proceed sooner. For Smith's team, these supposed mysteries might be boiled down to a couple of simple questions: Why can't Cannon just move faster? Why won't she shut Trump down, when he clearly wants delay for delay's sake? (If Trump wins the election, he might kill the case.) \"Each time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment,\" the prosecutors wrote in a filing a few weeks ago. \"That must stop.\"\n\nThat view, though, is too facile, even if the Smith team's frustration is understandable. Trump's motives may be obstructionist, and his legal arguments are often outrageous, but he's also got some nonfrivolous material to work with. There are three other criminal cases pending against him, which, in different ways, pose challenges for this one. Any trial involving classified evidence, as this one does, has an extra layer of complexity, governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA, and there are built-in problems with the Espionage Act itself. It's not an easy law to decipher, and the fact that the defendant is a former President makes it less so. And Cannon, who was appointed by Trump and has made a number of questionable rulings, is relatively new to the bench.\n\nThe complications build on one another, though. For example, Trump and his lawyers can examine certain evidence only in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. (In addition to delays, national-security trials involve a lot of acronyms.) The SCIF in question is in Florida; Trump is currently on trial in New York, for allegedly falsifying business records, which he denies. He has argued that one of his lawyers, Emil Bove, is a crucial part of his legal team in both cases. (Bove and other lawyers obtained security clearances to work with the evidence.) Cannon, in her order, moved one key CIPA-related deadline from this Thursday to June 17th.\n\nOn Tuesday, the same day that Cannon issued her order on the timing of the Florida trial, Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actor, took the stand in New York to talk about having sex with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, including her amusement at the brand of shampoo she saw in his hotel bathroom (Pert Plus). To put it mildly, her revelations are not on par with the facts in the Florida case, in which the interesting items allegedly spotted in a bathroom (this time at Mar-a-Lago) were boxes holding sensitive documents.\n\nThe New York trial had gone forward first because Trump's other trials were delayed for various reasons; with the delays, too, there is something of a negative-feedback loop. Jack Smith's other indictment against Trump, in Washington, D.C., which is related to January 6th, has been stalled because Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution for his \"official acts\" while President has made it to the Supreme Court. A further delay to the case brought in Georgia by the Fulton County D.A., Fani Willis -- in which Trump is charged with a conspiracy to overturn that state's election results -- emerged on Wednesday, when the Georgia Court of Appeals said that it would allow Trump and other defendants to argue again that Willis should be disqualified, because she had a romantic relationship with a lawyer she hired to handle Trump's prosecution. And so New York moved up in line, and now it, in turn, is contributing to the delay in Florida.\n\nBy the time of the July status conference, the Supreme Court should, at any rate, have handed down a ruling in the immunity case, Trump v. United States. Judging from the oral arguments in late April, the Justices are not likely to give Trump everything he wants, but they appear poised, at the very least, to require more proceedings that will delay the D.C. trial. It may not be obvious that such a decision would affect the Florida trial; the documents in question were stored in Mar-a-Lago well after Trump left office. But Trump has argued, in a motion filed in February, that all the Espionage Act charges stem from his alleged initial decision, in his last days as President, to \"cause the records to be moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago,\" and that that decision was an immunized official act. Cannon may be stalling to see whether the Supreme Court agrees in any way.\n\nThe most difficult aspect of the Florida case, though, may be the Espionage Act itself. Getting a conviction is not as simple as demonstrating that the documents at Mar-a-Lago were marked classified, because the relevant part of the Espionage Act does not actually mention classification. (Trump has been charged under section 793 (e); there is no allegation that he has committed espionage in the vernacular sense of spying.) In fact, although there have been some revisions over the years, the bulk of the Espionage Act dates back to 1917, before there was a classification system, which Truman introduced by means of an executive order. Instead, the act criminalizes \"unauthorized\" possession of information \"relating to the national defense\" -- now usually referred to as national-defense information, or N.D.I. This is, needless to say, a term that encompasses a lot. There is a body of case law about what N.D.I. may mean, which has developed over the decades -- often with reference to classification, although, confusingly, N.D.I. does not have to be designated classified, and things stamped classified are sometimes not regarded as N.D.I. -- but the Supreme Court hasn't spoken to the question in any definitive way since 1941, in Gorin v. United States. And that decision was not a model of clarity: it described \"national defense\" as \"a generic concept of broad connotations.\" (I wrote about the Espionage Act's complexities in a longer piece in 2023.)\n\nPartly as a result of the act's vagueness, the Justice Department does not prosecute every Espionage Act case it possibly could. If it did, a lot of journalists, who often publish classified information, would be in prison. In the case of Joe Biden, who kept documents marked classified in his Delaware home and office, the decision not to prosecute, according to Robert Hur, the special counsel in that case, turned on another required element of the law: \"willfulness.\" (My colleague Jeannie Suk Gersen has written about Hur's reasoning.)\n\nThere have, at least, been many Espionage Act cases that Cannon can look to when considering, for example, whether the Mar-a-Lago documents are N.D.I. But Trump's lawyers have zeroed in on yet another foggy term: \"unauthorized.\" What does that mean when it comes to former Presidents, who often do continue to have access to classified information, in one form or another? Roughly put, Trump is arguing that he was authorized to hold on to the documents by the Presidential Records Act, which allows outgoing Presidents to designate certain documents as \"personal records,\" while mandating that they hand over Presidential ones.\n\nThere is clearly some Trumpian absurdity here; a document about nuclear secrets, which the prosecutors allege Trump had, does not sound very personal. Even worse, he claims that no court can ever second-guess the personal designation -- if a President says that something is personal, it is. By that logic, the P.R.A. itself would become meaningless, because a President could issue a blanket order calling everything in the Oval Office personal. But the prosecutors' contention -- that the P.R.A is irrelevant to the Espionage Act, and that the executive order on the classification system should provide any answers that Cannon needs -- has holes, too. For example, what does the law say if something that has traditionally been recognized as a President's personal record (diaries, perhaps, such as the ones Ronald Reagan kept) also contains classified or national-defense information? Is it authorized? How do the laws interact? To be clear, a P.R.A.-based defense probably wouldn't (or shouldn't) ultimately help Trump if the records aren't plausibly personal; but it is another legal box to check, with the potential for more

He has pleaded not guilty and claimed the charges against him, along with those in three separate criminal trials, are politically motivated.\n\nCannon wrote in an order that the trial start date originally scheduled for May 20 would be delayed to address issues concerning classified evidence that need to be resolved before the federal criminal case can be presented before a jury. She did not set a new date.\n\nCannon wrote in the filing that \"finalization of a trial date at this juncture ... would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pretrial motions before the Court ...\" stating there were \"eight substantive pretrial motions\" that would take until at least late July.\n\nTuesday's decision by Cannon followed her granting Trump a delay in the trial a day earlier. On Monday, she temporarily stayed a May 9 deadline for Trump and his two co-defendants in the federal case to submit court filings.\n\nShe didn't set a new court trial date meaning it is unclear whether the case will get underway before the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nCannon's handling of the case, including the delay on Tuesday, has led to calls for her recusal. Multiple online petitions, which have received hundreds of thousands of signatures, have called for her to stand down with commentators joining in too.\n\nA post on X, formerly Twitter, by left-leaning news site Palmer Report, posted on May 8, 2024, viewed 122,500 times, said \"Once again, Judge Aileen Cannon does NOT have magical powers. She can't just decide to delay a trial forever. If that's indeed what she's trying to do with today's ruling, Jack Smith will get the 11th Circuit to overrule or remove her.\"\n\nActivist group Occupy Democrats also wrote \"This is a stunning betrayal of the American justice system. Judge Cannon should be removed from the bench immediately. It's undeniable now that she's a partisan MAGA operative.\"\n\nThe most significant maneuver toward recusal came in March after Cannon requested lawyers to file proposed jury instructions.\n\nCannon laid out two different legal scenarios, one which would instruct the jury to decide whether Trump did not have the authorization to keep classified documents found on his property, and the second in which it is assumed that Trump did have the authority to keep the records because he was president, per the Presidential Records Act (PRA).\n\nThe order was criticized by legal analysts and led to more calls for her removal from the case.\n\nIn his response, Jack Smith said her proposed instructions \"rest on an unstated and fundamentally flawed legal premise.\"\n\nHow Could Recusal Work?\n\nProfessor Todd Landman a professor of political science at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham, told Newsweek that many of the indictments in the case were not even based on PRA but under section 793(e) of the Espionage Act 1917, something Smith stated in his response to Cannon's request.\n\nSmith also wrote he may request a writ of mandamus, requiring the 11th Circuit of Appeals to review her legal rulings and actions to date, which could lead to her removal. However, Professor Landman said this remains a high bar for removal, would add to more delays, and leave open the possibility that she has been acting in remit.\n\n\"In either scenario, we can expect further delays to this case that will likely push it past the November election,\" Landman added.\n\n\"The 11th circuit would need to review her actions to determine if she is not acting impartially in the case and if it concluded she had not acted impartially, she could be removed and another judge would take over the case. This is the legal route that Jack Smith has at his disposal.\n\n\"It is not unprecedented in that it is a standard legal route. The judgment comes down to whether the review demonstrates that Judge Cannon has in some way been intentionally delaying matters or requiring both sides to engage in unnecessary proceedings.\"\n\nRichard Painter, a former White House Ethics Lawyer, told Newsweek that he had called for her recusal last June citing concerns regarding her impartiality.\n\n\"The prosecution should have requested her recusal then, or even earlier at the time of the 11 Circuit overturning her outrageous decision refusing to give the government access to its own documents after the Mar A Lago raid,\" Painter said.\n\n\"We are where we are now and recusal becomes more difficult as time goes on, although at the same time the evidence is mounting that this judge is not able to preside over this case fairly and expeditiously.\n\n\"The government should file a motion for her to recuse so the case can be assigned to another judge.\"\n\nThe potential success of moves now to remove Cannon, however, is disputed. In an interview with CNN this week, former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb said he didn't believe Jack Smith had a recourse on delaying the trial indefinitely.\n\n\"Scheduling is an area traditionally where judges have wide latitude. I don't think he would have the ability to have her removed on this or overruled on this,\" Cobb said.\n\nProfessor Bennett Gershman, a law professor at Pace University, also told Newsweek that as it stands now any effort by Smith to have her disqualified \"will almost certainly fail.\"\n\n\"Despite her bizarre rulings and delaying tactics, there is no clear evidence that she is biased against the government or has manifested an appearance of bias,\" Gershman said.\n\n\"There is really nothing in her conduct thus far that suggests she is not trying to be a diligent and careful jurist, however poorly she has comported herself in the bench.\"\n\nTrump is currently on trial in Manhattan in a separate case over claims he falsified business records to cover up the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels, a former pornographic actress, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and denies Daniels' claim that they had an affair in 2006.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Fani Willis' fornication is destroying the RICO case.\n\n\"Judge Aileen Cannon has indefinitely postponed the documents case trial. Lack of evidence is killing Alvin Bragg's case TRUMP IS WINNING BIGLY EVERYWHERE!\"\n\nPodcast host Benny Johnson wrote: \"Literally every case against Trump is running into a brick wall: Fani Willis -- CORRUPT Letitia James -- CORRUPT,\" a reference to New York Attorney General General Letitia James, who successfully sued Trump for filing fraudulent financial statements.\n\n\"Judge Merchan -- COMPROMISED Jack Smith -- LIAR. Why? Because these are FRAUDULENT cases are being run by CRIMINALS. And we are exposing them ONE BY ONE,\" Johnson added.\n\nState Freedom Caucus Network communications director Greg Price added: \"The Florida sham Trump trial is postponed indefinitely, the DC sham trial hangs on the SCOTUS immunity ruling, the Georgia sham trial is heading to appeal for Fani Willis' disqualification, and even liberals are admitting the New York sham trial is a clown show.\"\n\nAnother pro-Trump X user posted: \"Wow Fani's case is dead. Jack's case is teetering, Merchan is likely done with the lies from Stormy and the insurrection was planned by the agencies. Trump has momentum.\"\n\nTrump's legal team has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nIn a court filing on Tuesday, Cannon, who is overseeing the classified documents trial, said there are several other legal issues and deadlines that need to be resolved before she can confirm the start of the proceedings. The trial was originally set for May 20, but Cannon was long expected to postpone it beyond this date. Trump denies all wrongdoing in the case.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, rescheduled a number of pretrial deadlines, including one related to the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) on July 22, meaning the trial will definitely not start before then.\n\nThe following day, the Georgia Court of Appeals said it would consider an appeal to have Willis disqualified from overseeing the Georgia 2020 Election case which was another sign that the racketeering trial -- which does not have a confirmed start date -- could also be delayed for months.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee previously ruled Willis can remain as removed as the lead prosecutor after she was accused of having improper relationship with Nathan Wade. McCaffe ruled that Willis could remain on the case, only if Wade left.\n\nThe Supreme Court will also rule on whether the federal charges against Trump over his alleged criminal attempts to overturn the 2020 election results can be dismissed as the allegations relate to his time in the White House. The nation's highest court heard oral arguments on the immunity defense on April 25.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York after pleading not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to the $130,000 hush money he arranged for his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen to pay adult film star Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election. The payment was listed in Trump's company records as Cohen's \"legal fees.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mandamus is a way to get appellate review in extreme cases where appeal is not possible but the trial judge's decision is clearly wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"The scope of review by the circuit [court] on mandamus is very narrow. Mandamus would be a big gamble here and almost certainly lose.\"\n\nCannon is overseeing the case, in which former president Donald Trump is accused of illegally retaining classified documents, hoarding them at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and obstructing attempts by federal officials to retrieve them.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential election, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. He has denied any wrongdoing in the case and has said the documents he retained were personal.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, indefinitely postponed the trial on Tuesday, citing legal disputes around classified evidence. Cannon said there were eight outstanding substantive pending motions for her to rule on and predicted this will take until at least late July.\n\nIt is unknown whether the case will begin before the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nIf elected, Trump has a number of options to kill the trial, including pardoning himself or appointing a favorable attorney general to drop the charges.\n\nNewsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney and Cannon's office on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony V. Alfieri, a law professor at Miami University, told Newsweek that the decision to delay the trial indefinitely could be a reason for Smith to ask a higher court to remove her from the case.\n\nHe said Cannon's delay \"highlights continuing case management problems in her chambers and amplifies calls for her recusal.\"\n\n\"The recurrence of these seemingly insurmountable problems saps public confidence and trust in the judicial system,\" he said.\n\nJohn J. Perlstein, a Los Angeles-based litigation attorney, said that there were significant issues in handling the classified documents at the center of the indictment and therefore the case needed considerable time.\n\nHe said the delay is \"not surprising because the judge is a Trump appointee and in addition there are some significant legal issues involving the classified documents that will need hearings thus the case will take time.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com", "name": "Sean O'Driscoll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mandamus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389539/florida-judge-aileen-cannon.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9c8cd1b6f3b5772b6094e0f58b9eb3e5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

This case involves accusations related to attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nIn Fort Pierce, Florida, where the hearing took place, Trump faces numerous felony charges. These include willful retention of national defense information, false statements and representations, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, and corruptly concealing a document.\n\nTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHis co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, have also entered not guilty pleas. Nauta, Trump's former valet, and De Oliveira, a property manager at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, are accused of attempting to erase security video footage sought by the Justice Department.\n\nDe Oliveira faces additional charges of making false statements to prosecutors.\n\nThis postponement marks another significant delay in a series of legal challenges facing the former president, affecting

Cannon, a Trump appointee, said that setting a date would be \"imprudent\" before a number of pre-trial motions were addressed in her ruling. Special counsel Jack Smith unsealed a superseding indictment on July 27, 2023, that included charges against Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate owned by Trump after the special counsel initially secured a 37-count indictment against Trump and aide Walter Nauta in June 2023.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote. \"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\n\"There are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,\" Smith's filing said. \"There are several possible explanations, including the above-described instances in which the boxes were accessed, as well as the size and shape of certain items in the boxes possibly leading to movement of items. For example, the boxes contain items smaller than standard paper such as index cards, books, and stationary, which shift easily when the boxes are carried, especially because many of the boxes are not full.\"\n\nSmith's Friday filing also admitted in a footnote that the statement was \"inconsistent\" with what Cannon had been told in previous arguments.\n\nTrump's attorneys filed a motion Tuesday to address the reported violations, saying they would likely file additional motions.\n\n\"It never occurred to us, until last Friday, that the prosecution team could not be trusted to perform the basic task of maintaining the integrity of such evidence despite the expansive resources at their disposal,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.\n\n\"These issues implicate, for example, President Trump's motion to suppress evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and the motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct,\" Trump's attorney's added. \"President Trump will move to compel further disclosures regarding these issues in the event the Office does not turn over the materials sought in the May 4, 2024 letter. Moreover, after those further required disclosures, it is likely that President Trump will file additional motions for sanctions based on spoliation, including a motion to dismiss the charges if the Office cannot prove in a reliable way how it seized and handled the key evidence in the case, which will be a central issue at any trial.\"\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suppression of evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutorial_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutorial misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://tennesseestar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DCNF_logo-300.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1167, "textEnd": 1173}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts accusing him of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging US Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him four years ago.\n\nSmith faces significant obstacles to getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon has yet to rule on several legal issues crucial to the documents case and has signalled support for Trump\u2019s defence on some matters.\n\nIn a separate case brought by Smith involving Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, the US Supreme Court seems poised to recognise that former presidents have at least some immunity from prosecution over official actions.\n\nThat outcome mostly likely would further delay Trump\u2019s election-related case as lower courts determine which allegations against him are covered by that legal shield.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had said a trial in the documents case should not start until after the election, but also suggested an August 12 date in response to an order from Cannon to propose a timeline for the case. Smith proposed a July start date.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have worked to delay all four criminal cases he faces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution,\u201d said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason, an expert in white-collar criminal cases.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.\u201d\n\nTrump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15 on charges he unlawfully sought to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in state court in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to portray all the legal cases against him as politically motivated.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalises the unauthorised possession of national defence information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, nearly a quarter of Republican respondents and more than half of independents indicated they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicts him of a felony.\n\nIf either federal case reaches a jury before the election, it would probably be in the weeks immediately before November 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from Trump\u2019s legal team.\n\n\u201cAny judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,\u201d said lawyer Kel McClanahan, who specialises in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.\n\nBut a Trump win in November may mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, Trump could direct the Justice Department to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nSmith\u2019s team has pushed aggressive deadlines in the Florida case, arguing that the public has a right to a speedy trial. Prosecutor Jay Bratt told Cannon during a hearing that an autumn trial would not violate US Justice Department guidelines that prohibit taking investigative steps close to an election that could impact the outcome of the vote.\n\nCannon has denied two bids by Trump to dismiss the charges, but several remain pending. She also has signalled that Trump\u2019s claims that the documents were personal records may be relevant to how she instructs the jury at a future trial, a decision that could lead to an appeal by prosecutors and more delays.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Win McNamee/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on May 7 reset deadlines in the case special counsel Jack Smith is prosecuting against former President Donald Trump, blowing past the original May 20 trial date with pretrial deadlines running through July.\n\nJudge Cannon did not set a new trial date in the order, finding it premature.\n\nThe judge had signaled this possibility earlier in the year, referencing the amount of litigation around what classified information will be used in the case. Such litigation will continue through July 22 according to the judge's new calendar, which lists several major hearings.\n\nPresident Trump was charged with 40 counts related to allegedly mishandling classified information. His valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira were charged alongside him as codefendants.\n\nAdding to the classified information issues, President Trump is currently on trial in New York where prosecutors estimate needing up to three more weeks to present their case, and he is required to be present during the trial. If defense attorneys call additional witnesses, it may add to the trial length in New York.\n\nJudge Cannon wrote that to set a date now before resolving the \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues\" would not be fair or prudent.\n\nThe judge still has before her several motions to dismiss charges or the indictment entirely, motions to unseal information the defendants argue are critical in the case, and ongoing discovery issues to resolve.\n\nJudge Cannon revealed that there are eight substantive motions to rule on, two of which have not been publicly docketed, and \"extensive\" discovery issues.\n\nMr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira had demanded a speedy trial, which puts prosecutors and the court on a clock to bring the case to trial, and Judge Cannon said she has weighed the Speedy Trial Act against due process rights.\n\n\"Upon such review, the Court finds that the ends of justice served by this continuance, through the last deadline specified in this Order, July 22, 2024, outweigh the best interest of the public and Defendants in a speedy trial,\" she wrote.\n\nPossibly complicating matters is the prosecutors' recent admission that the order of the documents in the boxes seized is not the same as the order of the scanned copies given to the defense, leading defendants to argue for additional discovery that could further move deadlines.\n\nThe judge had previously already scheduled a sealed May 8 hearing over grand jury matters, as defendants have requested some grand jury transcripts be made public. She has scheduled a deadline to resolve seal requests by May 20, the original trial date.\n\nOn May 22, the court will hold a hearing on Mr. Nauta's motion to dismiss the indictment for selective and vindictive prosecution, a motion that was just recently unsealed. The judge will hear arguments on the defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment for insufficient pleading on the same day.\n\nOn June 21, the court will hear arguments on whether the special counsel's appointment was lawful. The argument that Mr. Smith's office is unconstitutional is one that has been advanced by former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, in amicus briefs, in both cases Mr. Smith is prosecuting against President Trump. Defense attorneys in these cases have adopted these arguments to various degrees.\n\nFrom June 24 to June 26, partial evidentiary hearings will be held regarding the defense's motion to compel discovery from prosecutors, and the scope of what the prosecution is required to hand over.\n\nAmici wishing to argue at any hearing have a June 3 deadline to request permission from the court.\n\nJudge Cannon has set a July 22 status conference, after which a trial date is likely to emerge.\n\nMajor deadlines for disclosures have also been updated.\n\nOn May 31, parties are required to submit an update regarding discovery.\n\nThe defense's original May 9 deadline to disclose what expert testimonies they will use regarding classified information was postponed a month, to June 10.\n\nDefendants have a June 17 deadline to submit notice of all classified information they intend to disclose. Prosecutors have a July 9 deadline to supplement expert disclosures if necessary, and a July 10 deadline for reciprocal classified information discovery.\n\nThe judge noted that such a deadline would normally not be set until classified information disclosures by the defense are resolved, which is scheduled for a sealed July 22 hearing, but she has set one to accommodate the prosecutors' requests.\n\nDefendants were also given a July 19 deadline to submit a speedy trial report.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due Process Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docket_(court)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Docket (court)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Meese", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edwin Meese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amicus curiae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/id991270-Trump-trial-GettyImages-2151409855.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Postpones Trump's Classified Documents Trial", "body": "Judge Aileen Cannon issued an order on Tuesday afternoon setting a second set of \"pre-trial deadlines/hearings\" in the case dealing with former President Donald Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and, perhaps most notably, indefinitely postponed the start date for a trial.\n\nThe second set of deadlines to \"manage pending discovery and disclosure matters, adjudicate pre-trial motions before the Court, and advance through additional stages of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA)\" set by Judge Cannon on Tuesday range from a May 8 hearing on grand jury matters to a supplemental CIPA hearing on July 22.\n\nAccording to Judge Cannon, the court determined \"that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nAs a result of that determination, Judge Cannon vacated the \"current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nJudge Cannon also explained that there are \"eight substantive pretrial motions,\" \"extensive defense motions to compel discovery on a host of issues spanning hundreds of pages of classified and unclassified briefing and exhibits,\" \"a contested motion to define and enforce the scope of the prosecution team for discovery purposes,\" and \"partially resolved CIPA \u00a7 4 litigation requiring a supplemental hearing to be set following resolution of certain aspects of Defendants' pending motions to compel.\"\n\nThe current state of play, Judge Cannon concluded, means that \"the ends of justice served by this continuance, through the last deadline specified in this Order, July 22, 2024, outweigh the best interest of the public and Defendants in a speedy trial\" and said the indefinite delay of a start date will \"permit adequate time for hearings and adjudication of substantive pretrial motions, discovery disputes, and CIPA issues, many of which present novel and difficult questions.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType":

Specifically, a collective mourning over the fact that this trial won't go before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMost emblematic of the coverage: ABC, with its lengthy (for a brief) anchor introduction and framing question. Watch the full report as aired on ABC World News Tonight on Tuesday, May 7th, 2024:\n\nDAVID MUIR: And meanwhile, there's another breaking headline involving the former president tonight. The judge overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case at Mar-a-Lago has now indefinitely postponed that trial. Is there any chance this now happens before Election Day? Let's get right to our Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas, live in Washington. Pierre, what have you learned?\n\nPIERRE THOMAS: David, the likelihood there will be a trial in the classified documents case before the election is fading fast. Judge Aileen Cannon has officially taken a May 20th trial date off the calendar, saying there were too many pretrial motions and legal issues to resolve before trial could go forward. Some of the issues have sat for months, and some are not even scheduled for hearings until later this month or June. The special counsel tonight declining to comment. But David, this delay makes it all but certain the classified documents case will not go to trial before the election.\n\nMUIR: Pierre Thomas tonight with us as well. Pierre, thank you.\n\nABC Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas felt compelled to provide a full rundown as to the procedural reasons why the classified documents trial isn't going forward, complaining that \"some of the issues have sat for months\". Thomas then whines that this case will not go to trial before the election.\n\nA similar tone was struck at CBS, as far as whining over a lack of a trial before the general election. Below is the transcript of the full report as aired on CBS Evening News on Tuesday, May 7th, 2024:\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL: And Robert, I do need to ask you about a separate trial involving that classified documents. What have we learned today about that trial?\n\nROBERT COSTA: Norah, a stunning development late today. Florida federal judge Aileen Cannon has now decided to indefinitely postpone that classified documents trial that was looming on the horizon for the former president, raising a real question about whether Trump will ever face a trial on that front before the election, or even this year.\n\nO'DONNELL: Robert Costa, thank you.\n\nDespite Costa's hysterics, the development is not all that stunning. Not mentioned in these reports is that at least some of the hangup in the classified documents case is due to the procedures governing discovery under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which governs discovery in this trial. Costa might not have been so stunned, perhaps, had he read CBS's own primer on CIPA.\n\nFun fact, per the report: the CIPA bill was originally introduced by Senator Joe Biden.\n\nFinally, on NBC, the same lamentations citing the same complex motions, with one added bonus: Lester Holt and Laura Jarrett work in the January 6th trial, which is also on hold pending the Supreme Court's opinion on presidential immunity. Below is the transcript of the full report as aired on NBC Nightly News on Tuesday, May 7th, 2024:\n\nLESTER HOLT: And Laura, at the top of the newscast, I mentioned a big development in another Trump case, this, the classified documents case in Florida. What happened?\n\nLAURA JARRETT: Yes, Lester, the judge tonight making official what was already widely expected, putting that trial date officially on hold, wiping it away, saying essentially there are too many unresolved issues and complex motions left to resolve here, Lester.\n\nHOLT: And one more federal case, the one focusing on election interference. Where does that stand?\n\nJARRETT: Lester, that one too also in limbo, with no trial date as we await a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court about whether the former president is in fact immune from prosecution at all, making this case in New York, Lester, perhaps the only case that will be complete before the November election. Lester.\n\nHOLT: All right. Laura Jarrett, thanks.\n\nLaura Jarrett closes her report by noting that the New York trial may well be the only one to conclude before the 2024 presidential election, thus forcing the left to settle for one quarter of its originally-scheduled judicial election interference- much to the chagrin of the Regime Media.", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trump had appointed Cannon, who previously decided that the case's jury selection would begin on May 20.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the judge went on to schedule over a dozen additional hearings and deadlines for lawyers through July. She said she could rule on \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues\" before the trial started, referring to the Classified Information Procedures Act.\n\nLegal experts and political strategists told Business Insider that Cannon's move did not come as a surprise and on earlier occasions too, she has sided with the former president. \"With Judge Canon reversing her own decision today, there is a high likelihood the case will get pushed out past the election,\" litigation and appeals attorney Katie Charleston said.\n\nIf this is the case, Trump might dodge the trial completely if he is elected president in November. He might as well get rid of the cases brought against him by the Justice Department.\n\nThe former president has been charged with as many as 37 counts, including 31 alleged violations of the Espionage Act for \"willful retention of national defense information\" in connection with his handling of classified documents that were taken to his Mar-a-Lago club. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCannon had previously ruled that the classified document should be reviewed by a special master. However, the decision was reversed in an opinion by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. In the past, Cannon also refused to comply with the special counsel's request to hide the names of the case's potential witnesses. However, last month, she agreed to redact witness names. She said that witness statements, however, will be disclosed in pretrial motions.\n\nCannon's critics have wondered whether her favouring Trump is due to bias, inexperience, or \"analysis paralysis,\" as noted by CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, said, \"Judge Cannon has ruled in Trump's favor at almost every possible turn, so I'm not surprised that she delayed the trial indefinitely. She is inexperienced and seems in over her head. She's made a number of bizarre rulings that aren't supported by logic or the law, and she has already been overturned by the 11th Circuit multiple times.\"\n\nRahmani said that the delay is indeed a win for Trump, \"especially in the middle of another trial and the presidential campaign,\" making this ruling \"yet another win for Trump in South Florida.\"\n\nTy Cobb, a former Trump White House attorney, said that the judge's latest decision was \"a combination of bias and incompetence,\" according to CNN. \"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" he said.\n\nDoron Kalir, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law, echoed the others' thoughts, saying Trump's egal strategy in his four criminal cases is \"delay, delay, delay.\"",

It is possible that the documents trial, along with the two others, could be postponed until after their expected rematch in the November election.\n\nIf Trump were to beat Biden in that race, then as president he would be in a position to ask the Justice Department to drop all of the pending charges against him.\n\nCannon's procedural but significant ruling follows her decision in April rejecting Trump's bid to throw out the classified documents case, concluding that the Presidential Records Act \"does not provide a pre-trial basis to dismiss\" the 42-count indictment.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued at a hearing in March in the Fort Pierce federal courthouse that he designated the documents as his own personal property when he took them from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach after leaving office and therefore he had the authority to keep them.\n\nIn her three-page order, Cannon rejected the Trump legal team's reasoning, saying most of the counts in the indictment fall under the Espionage Act, which states that without authorization it is illegal to retain any national defense documents and fail to turn them over to the U.S. government. She noted that the indictment's 32 espionage charges make no reference to the Presidential Records Act. She also pointed out that the remaining obstruction of justice and other charges are not based on the Presidential Records Act either.\n\n\"More generally, the superseding indictment specifies the nature of the accusations against Defendant Trump in a lengthy speaking indictment with embedded excerpts from investigative interviews, photographs, and other content,\" Cannon wrote, emphasizing that the charges \"track the statutory language\" of the Espionage Act.\n\nPreviously, after the March 14 hearing in her courtroom, Cannon also rejected another dismissal motion by Trump's lawyers, who argued that the Espionage Act was vague and should be struck down entirely.\n\nIn the classified documents case, Trump's lawyers argued that he is \"immune from prosecution ... because the charges turn on his alleged decision to designate records as personal under the Presidential Records Act and to cause the records to be moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"As alleged in the superseding indictment, President Trump made this decision while he was still in office,\" their motion states. \"The alleged decision was an official act, and as such is subject to presidential immunity.\"\n\nJustice Department: No right to the documents\n\nJustice Department lawyers on special counsel Jack Smith's team urged Cannon to reject Trump's dismissal motion, saying the former president had no legal right to retain the classified records at his Palm Beach estate as he refused to turn them over to federal authorities for storage at the National Archives in Washington.\n\nThe criminal case over Trump's retention of classified documents was brought against the former president last June, and was expanded the following month in an indictment naming two other defendants: Walt Nauta, a former White House aide who still works with the ex-president, and Carlos De Oliveira, a property manager of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nMiami grand jury\n\nThe indictment, returned by a Miami federal grand jury, alleges Trump brought a few underlings at his Palm Beach estate into a close circle that prosecutors say assisted him in trying to hide boxes of classified documents from authorities and to delete video security footage of Mar-a-Lago's storage area and nearby hallway linked to the residence.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Trump spoke with De Oliveira for 24 minutes after the Justice Department informed his legal team on June 22, 2022, of a draft grand jury subpoena for the surveillance footage at Mar-a-Lago. Two days later, the subpoena was officially delivered to Trump's residence.\n\nOn June 25, after changing his travel plans, Nauta flew to the Palm Beach estate. Then, on June 27, Nauta collaborated with De Oliveira to find and destroy the surveillance video, the indictment states.\n\nThe indictment does not say whether Trump, Nauta or De Oliveira were successful in deleting any of the video footage. But previous filings in the unprecedented case show that a June 2022 grand jury subpoena uncovered video images that prosecutors with the special counsel's office say revealed damning evidence.\n\nSearch of Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe information provided the basis for FBI agents to obtain a court-approved warrant to search Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8, 2022, when they found and seized more than 100 classified documents in the former president's office and the club's storage area.\n\nCannon was nominated by Trump and joined the federal bench in South Florida at the end of his term in 2020. She drew criticism after she made a controversial call in 2022 to appoint an independent expert, at Trump's behest, to examine classified government materials seized by FBI agents from his Palm Beach residence before the former president was indicted the following year.\n\nA federal three-judge appellate panel, all Republican-appointees like Cannon, reversed her decision to name a \"special master\" because she had no authority to do so and effectively killed Trump's civil case aiming to thwart the impending indictment.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Cannon, a Trump appointee, said that setting a date would be \"imprudent\" before a number of pre-trial motions were addressed in her ruling. Special counsel Jack Smith unsealed a superseding indictment on July 27, 2023, that included charges against Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate owned by Trump after the special counsel initially secured a 37-count indictment against Trump and aide Walter Nauta in June 2023.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote. \"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nSmith admitted in a Friday afternoon filing that evidence had not been properly maintained by federal investigators following the Aug. 8, 2022, raid on Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate owned by the former president.\n\n\"There are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,\" Smith's filing said. \"There are several possible explanations, including the above-described instances in which the boxes were accessed, as well as the size and shape of certain items in the boxes possibly leading to movement of items. For example, the boxes contain items smaller than standard paper such as index cards, books, and stationary, which shift easily when the boxes are carried, especially because many of the boxes are not full.\"\n\nSmith's Friday filing also admitted in a footnote that the statement was \"inconsistent\" with what Cannon had been told in previous arguments.\n\nTrump's attorneys filed a motion Tuesday to address the reported violations, saying they would likely file additional motions.\n\n\"It never occurred to us, until last Friday, that the prosecution team could not be trusted to perform the basic task of maintaining the integrity of such evidence despite the expansive resources at their disposal,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.\n\n\"These issues implicate, for example, President Trump's motion to suppress evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and the motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct,\" Trump's attorney's added. \"President Trump will move to compel further disclosures regarding these issues in the event the Office does not turn over the materials sought in the May 4, 2024 letter. Moreover, after those further required disclosures, it is likely that President Trump will file additional motions for sanctions based on spoliation, including a motion to dismiss the charges if the Office cannot prove in a reliable way how it seized and handled the key evidence in the case, which will be a central issue at any trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Daily-Caller-News-Foundation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1167, "textEnd": 1173}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Judge Scott McAfee previously ruled that Willis could stay on the case following a trial over her relationship with attorney Nathan Wade.\n\nMcAfee ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped down, but Trump's legal team filed an appeal to McAfee's ruling.

Why are 3 of Trump's 4 criminal trials delayed indefinitely?", "body": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's public defense against his four, distinct prosecutions in four, separate jurisdictions is that they are a coordinated hit job and a political persecution - evidence, he says, of a double standard of justice.\n\nDisproving Trump's allegation is the likelihood, which seems to be growing this week, that three of the four criminal prosecutions might not reach the courtroom before Election Day.\n\nThe other prosecution - generally seen as the weakest case against Trump - has provided salacious and embarrassing moments for the former president. But the facts of that case in New York, focused on his effort to hide an alleged affair rather than his conduct as president or his effort to overturn the 2020 election, feel like something from a different time.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases.\n\nIf Trump could manufacture a conspiracy theory out of the fact that separate grand juries in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, DC, all independently approved charges against him, what would he make of the following series of events?\n\nClassified documents case postponed indefinitely\n\nTrump appointed the judge in the Florida case, Aileen Cannon, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But Cannon has angered critics who see slow-walking in the length of time she takes to return decisions and pandering in her deference to Trump's requests to delay the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cannon scratched the planned May trial date and did not pencil in a new one. With multiple outstanding issues in the federal case, legal experts are now doubting the trial - in which special counsel Jack Smith alleges Trump mishandled classified data he refused to turn over to the National Archives - will occur before November.\n\nTrump's former White House counsel Ty Cobb, now a Trump critic, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday night that Cannon has so far failed in the trial.\n\n\"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" Cobb told Burnett. In the judge's slow work, Cobb sees \"a combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's slow schedule is helping Trump\n\nThe other federal case, in which Smith accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results and rob Americans of their democratic rights, is also on hold in Washington, DC, thanks to the US Supreme Court.\n\nFirst, justices refused to fast-track reviewing Trump's dubious claim of \"absolute immunity\" from criminal prosecution, instead preferring to allow that claim to proceed through oral arguments before a panel of judges in a lower court.\n\nWhen that lower court rejected Trump's absolute immunity claim, however, the Supreme Court suddenly wanted to have its say. Conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, seemed to not necessarily buy into the more outlandish extremes of his argument during a hearing last month - such as the hypothetical scenario of Seal Team 6 being ordered to take out a political rival - but they were intrigued enough to suggest their decision will not simply allow the trial to go forward.\n\nWhenever they get around to issuing it, that is. Could be June or July! Which would leave little time for a trial.\n\nTrump's effort to disqualify the prosecutor in Georgia continues\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' relationship with a prosecutor shouldn't necessarily have anything to do with the allegations against Trump, which are related to his effort to overturn election results in Georgia in 2020. But the fallout of her decision to employ her former boyfriend is helping Trump.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it would consider Trump's appeal of Judge Scott McAfee's decision to allow Willis to remain on the case.\n\nThe New York Case is salacious, but where does it lead?\n\nThe tawdry details of Trump's alleged affair with adult-film star Stormy Daniels are nothing Trump wanted to see, as he stared Daniels down in court on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's lawyers may drag out the cross-examination of Daniels when the trial resumes on Thursday as they seek to impeach her credibility. That should be a preview of the trial's coming showdown between Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, an admitted liar and convicted felon, and attorneys for the boss for whom Cohen says he broke campaign finance law.\n\nThere may have been a good reason federal prosecutors passed on this case and decided not to pursue it.\n\nThe point here is that for all of Trump's controversial actions as president and his clear attempt to change election results, a conviction for falsifying business records, if it even comes, may not be what sways those few voters in swing states who will decide this election.\n\nTrump's prosecutions are no grand conspiracy of election interference. They're part of a slow-working justice system in which it helps to have the resources, thanks to donors, to pay an army of lawyers who can gum up the works. Trump's long-standing strategy is to delay his trials, get elected and then work to make them go away. From that perspective, this has been a good week for him.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

ruled to indefinitely postpone the trial, citing a burdensome number of \"outstanding pre-trial motions\" unlikely to be resolved by the anticipated May 20 trial date.\n\nThe \"finalization of a trial

His legal strategy of delays, appeals and other tactics has allowed him to avoid having to see the inside of a courtroom in three of his four trials for likely the remainder of 2024.\n\nREAD MORE: GA reporter: Here's what happens with Trump's Fulton County trial after Fani Willis decision\n\n\"Trump is a master at denial and delay,\" Ayres said. \"He's got a lot of experience with it, but he also has a Justice Department that waited a long time to get serious about prosecuting [the Mar-a-Lago case].\"\n\nThe former president's indictment in the Southern District of Florida is seen as the most damning for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith has compiled a wealth of evidence since the FBI's 2022 raid on Mar-a-Lago, in which boxes of classified government documents are seen in official photos strewn about the ex-president's home in a haphazard fashion. Ayres called that case \"strong as battery acid.\"\n\n\"If any of us had done what Trump had done with the documents, not only would we be indicted now, we would be in jail,\" Ayres said.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Mary McCord agreed, telling Bloomberg that the ex-president benefited from the luck of the draw when the 11th Circuit randomly assigned a conservative judge he appointed in the final year of his presidency to the case. She said a different judge may not have been as \"accommodating to Trump\" and likely would have kept the pre-trial process moving at a steady clip.\n\nREAD MORE: Former Trump lawyer slams Judge Cannon for indefinitely postponing docs trial\n\n\"It's been a combination of the legal strategy, which is delay, and then certain courts and certain actions by some of the courts that have allowed that strategy to be successful,\" McCord said.\n\nAside from his Georgia case and his Mar-a-Lago case, Trump has also succeeded in pushing off his DC election interference trial to a much later date as well -- potentially also beyond Election Day. The Supreme Court agreed to hear his appeal of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to not grant him absolute immunity from criminal prosecution, and may not issue a ruling until its term ends in June. And because U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has said that both sides would get up to three months of preparation before going to trial, that could mean Trump won't receive a verdict in the January 6 case until after the general election.\n\nCurrently, Trump's Manhattan trial is still underway, and is expected to conclude in June. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records relating to hush money payments he allegedly orchestrated to women who claimed to have had extramarital affairs with him prior to the 2016 election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg maintains that those payments were in the furtherance of Trump's political ambitions, making them illegal campaign contributions.\n\nClick here to read Bloomberg's report in full (subscription required).", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

Will it be held before Election Day?", "body": "The odds against Donald Trump facing trial before the presidential election on charges of withholding classified documents from the government at his Palm Beach estate rose dramatically Tuesday when a federal judge indefinitely postponed the former president's originally scheduled May 20 trial.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over the documents case at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, found that \"the finalization of a trial date at this juncture ... would be imprudent and inconsistent with the court's duty\" to resolve numerous legal issues \"necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nCannon rescheduled various pressing matters, including a motion to dismiss the indictment for selective and vindictive prosecution as well as the use of sensitive national security records at trial, through the end of July.\n\nHer decision comes as Trump, the expected Republican nominee for president in November, is on trial in New York on criminal charges of paying hush-money to a porn star, and hiding that in order to boost his election chances in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAfter hearing oral arguments in April, the U.S. Supreme Court is also preparing to issue an opinion on whether Trump has immunity against criminal prosecution.\n\nHanging in the balance is not only Trump's classified documents case but his federal trial in Washington, D.C., and state trial in Georgia on charges accusing him of interfering in the outcome of the November 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. It is possible that the documents trial, along with the two others, could be postponed until after their expected rematch in the November election.\n\nIf Trump were to beat Biden in that race, then as president he would be in a position to ask the Justice Department to drop all of the pending charges against him.\n\nCannon's procedural but significant ruling follows her decision in April rejecting Trump's bid to throw out the classified documents case, concluding that the Presidential Records Act \"does not provide a pre-trial basis to dismiss\" the 42-count indictment.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued at a hearing in March in the Fort Pierce federal courthouse that he designated the documents as his own personal property when he took them from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach after leaving office and therefore he had the authority to keep them.\n\nIn her three-page order, Cannon rejected the Trump legal team's reasoning, saying most of the counts in the indictment fall under the Espionage Act, which states that without authorization it is illegal to retain any national defense documents and fail to turn them over to the U.S. government. She noted that the indictment's 32 espionage charges make no reference to the Presidential Records Act. She also pointed out that the remaining obstruction of justice and other charges are not based on the Presidential Records Act either.\n\n\"More generally, the superseding indictment specifies the nature of the accusations against Defendant Trump in a lengthy speaking indictment with embedded excerpts from investigative interviews, photographs, and other content,\" Cannon wrote, emphasizing that the charges \"track the statutory language\" of the Espionage Act.\n\nPreviously, after the March 14 hearing in her courtroom, Cannon also rejected another dismissal motion by Trump's lawyers, who argued that the Espionage Act was vague and should be struck down entirely.\n\nIn the classified documents case, Trump's lawyers argued that he is \"immune from prosecution ... because the charges turn on his alleged decision to designate records as personal under the Presidential Records Act and to cause the records to be moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"As alleged in the superseding indictment, President Trump made this decision while he was still in office,\" their motion states. \"The alleged decision was an official act, and as such is subject to presidential immunity.\"\n\nJustice Department: No right to the documents\n\nJustice Department lawyers on special counsel Jack Smith's team urged Cannon to reject Trump's dismissal motion, saying the former president had no legal right to retain the classified records at his Palm Beach estate as he refused to turn them over to federal authorities for storage at the National Archives in Washington.\n\nThe criminal case over Trump's retention of classified documents was brought against the former president last June, and was expanded the following month in an indictment naming two other defendants: Walt Nauta, a former White House aide who still works with the ex-president, and Carlos De Oliveira, a property manager of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nMiami grand jury\n\nThe indictment, returned by a Miami federal grand jury, alleges Trump brought a few underlings at his Palm Beach estate into a close circle that prosecutors say assisted him in trying to hide boxes of classified documents from authorities and to delete video security footage of Mar-a-Lago's storage area and nearby hallway linked to the residence.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Trump spoke with De Oliveira for 24 minutes after the Justice Department informed his legal team on June 22, 2022, of a draft grand jury subpoena for the surveillance footage at Mar-a-Lago. Two days later, the subpoena was officially delivered to Trump's residence.\n\nOn June 25, after changing his travel plans, Nauta flew to the Palm Beach estate. Then, on June 27, Nauta collaborated with De Oliveira to find and destroy the surveillance video, the indictment states.\n\nThe indictment does not say whether Trump, Nauta or De Oliveira were successful in deleting any of the video footage. But previous filings in the unprecedented case show that a June 2022 grand jury subpoena uncovered video images that prosecutors with the special counsel's office say revealed damning evidence.\n\nSearch of Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe information provided the basis for FBI agents to obtain a court-approved warrant to search Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8, 2022, when they found and seized more than 100 classified documents in the former president's office and the club's storage area.\n\nCannon was nominated by Trump and joined the federal bench in South Florida at the end of his term in 2020. She drew criticism after she made a controversial call in 2022 to appoint an independent expert, at Trump's behest, to examine classified government materials seized by FBI agents from his Palm Beach residence before the former president was indicted the following year.\n\nA federal three-judge appellate panel, all Republican-appointees like Cannon, reversed her decision to name a \"special master\" because she had no authority to do so and effectively killed Trump's civil case aiming to thwart the impending indictment.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Cannon, a Trump appointee, said that setting a date would be \"imprudent\" before a number of pre-trial motions were addressed. Special Counsel Jack Smith unsealed a superseding indictment on July 27, 2023, that included charges against Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate owned by former President Trump after the special counsel initially secured a 37-count indictment against Trump and his aide Walter Nauta in June 2023\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote. \"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court, consistent with Defendants' right to due process and the public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\n\"There are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,\" Smith's filing said. \"There are several possible explanations, including the above-described instances in which the boxes were accessed, as well as the size and shape of certain items in the boxes possibly leading to movement of items. For example, the boxes contain items smaller than standard paper such as index cards, books, and stationary, which shift easily when the boxes are carried, especially because many of the boxes are not full.\"\n\nSmith's Friday filing also admitted in a footnote that the statement was \"inconsistent\" with what Cannon had been told in previous arguments.\n\nTrump's attorneys filed a motion Tuesday to address the reported violations, saying they would likely file additional motions.\n\n\"It never occurred to us, until last Friday, that the prosecution team could not be trusted to perform the basic task of maintaining the integrity of such evidence despite the expansive resources at their disposal,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.\n\n\"These issues implicate, for example, President Trump's motion to suppress evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and the motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct,\" Trump's attorneys added. \"President Trump will move to compel further disclosures regarding these issues in the event the Office does not turn over the materials sought in the May 4, 2024 letter. Moreover, after those further required disclosures, it is likely that President Trump will file additional motions for sanctions based on spoliation, including a motion to dismiss the charges if the Office cannot prove in a reliable way how it seized and handled the key evidence in the case, which will be a central issue at any trial.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

You might ask, isn't she the person tasked with sorting through those questions, and shouldn't that have happened already? But that would betray a fundamental misunderstanding of what Cannon's job is here, which is to serve as a warm-up comic for a talk show host who isn't actually coming to the set that day.\n\nCannon's decision is part of a months-long standoff with Special Counsel Jack Smith, who has grown increasingly frustrated with Cannon's transparent delay tactics. In April, Cannon requested jury instructions regarding the Presidential Records Act -- which isn't the statute under which Trump is being prosecuted. That would be the Espionage Act. Cannon requested jury instructions that reflected \"different scenarios,\" including one with the Trump defense's premise that he was legally entitled to walk out of the White House with basically whatever classified information he wanted. \"That legal premise is wrong,\" Smith wrote last month, \"and a jury instruction... that reflects that premise would distort the trial.\"\n\nA brief recap of the case is probably in order. When Trump left office in a childish huff weeks after trying to overthrow the American system of government in early 2021, he carted reams of classified material with him to his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. The prosecution alleges that he was deeply involved in preparing these materials and spiriting them away to Florida. He bragged about it to whoever was listening, basically dared the federal government to come and retrieve its property and then refused to cooperate with government officials who were bending over backward to avoid a scene -- or a prosecution of a former president already facing a litany of other potential charges for other crimes committed before, during, and after his presidency. Trump was ultimately charged with 37 counts of violating the Espionage Act, making false statements, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThis isn't the first delay in the trial. Cannon took two months to rule on a February 2024 motion to dismiss the case from the defense, based on the idea that he was entitled to take whatever he wanted to Mar-a-Lago under the Presidential Records Act. She had already managed to push the trial back months, by insisting, for example, on a plodding third-party review of the documents. The very real complications of conducting a trial about classified documents (including restrictions on who can see the documents and where they can see them) means that they are going to run headlong into the schedule for Trump's D.C.-based election interference and insurrection trial, which is itself being delayed by the Supreme Court's outrageous decision to consider Trump's total immunity from any crime committed as president.\n\nThe endgame here is not subtle. Trump's entire legal strategy for this has been from the very beginning to somehow delay it until after the 2024 election. At that point, Trump hopes to be president-elect, and then to pardon himself, his associates and anyone else involved with his vast criminal enterprise after he is inaugurated. Cannon, cleverly, has never directly endorsed that logic but with every decision big and small, she has sought to indirectly manifest it. That leaves Trump and Cannon with the best of both worlds -- the appearance of impartiality but the practical effect of making it impossible to prosecute the case until the 2024 election has been decided.\n\nThe fact that Cannon is a Trump appointee -- a controversial one at that, given her lack of jury trial experience at the time of her nomination in 2020 -- is not necessarily the issue. Federal judges are appointed by presidents of both parties and their provenance should not have any bearing on individual cases. A strong argument for recusal could be made here, though, given Trump's role in elevating her to her position in the first place. The truly troubling pattern that has emerged from Cannon's courtroom, however, is a bizarre deference to every half-baked scheme put forward by the Trump legal team and her refusal to move the trial along at even a snail's pace.\n\nCannon's delay tactics are now merely part of a tapestry of judicial and prosecutorial failure that has left the federal government incapable of prosecuting a man who still makes open threats to the constitutional order. If you can't prosecute a former government official, particularly one who is seeking to once again claim the presidency and the near-total impunity that the Supreme Court apparently thinks comes along with it, in the four long years between presidential elections, the American system of governance is much more vulnerable to authoritarian takeover than was previously understood. It means that virtually any president or White House official can commit crimes with impunity knowing that their team will probably be back in power by the time the wheels of justice start grinding along.\n\nWhat happens next is anyone's guess. Smith could seek to have Cannon removed from the trial, a richly deserved outcome but perhaps not one that will move things along more swiftly. Ultimately, it looks like it will once again fall to America's voters to hold up the country's once-vaunted democratic guardrails, since no one in the federal government seems interested in or capable of keeping the republic away from this criminal huckster who is openly telegraphing his plans to subvert democracy - again.\n\nDavid Faris is an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University and the author of It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics.

They say she has failed to manage her courtroom efficiently, showing a lack of experience on the bench.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the chair of the Senate Judiciary panel's federal courts and oversight subcommittee, said it looks like Cannon is \"deliberately slow-walking the case.\"\n\n\"Judges are responsible for managing their calendars and for seeing to it that issues are addressed timely, so it is hard for me not to reach the conclusion that this [judge] is deliberately slow-walking the case to put it into a position where should [Trump] be elected, he can order that the investigation and prosecution be terminated,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nWhat does it mean for Trump's charges?\n\nDemocrats are close to giving up hope that the 40 felony charges accusing Trump of mishandling classified documents, obstructing justice and making false statements will reach a verdict before Election Day.\n\nAnd they fear he will immediately kill the case if he defeats President Biden in November and returns to the Oval Office.\n\n\"Justice deferred is often justice denied. It is profoundly frustrating that the judge is managing this case in a way that is making it highly unlikely that it will be resolved in a timely fashion,\" said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSenate Democrats are pointing to a series of rulings by Cannon, a longtime member of the Federalist Society whom Trump nominated to the federal bench in 2020, that are unusual and favorable to the former president's defense.\n\nWhat has Cannon done?\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who is handling the case, complained in a 24-page filing last month that Cannon had issued a \"fundamentally flawed\" order to file preliminary jury instructions contemplating the possibility that Trump was authorized under the Presidential Records Act to turn classified documents into his personal property.\n\nSmith's legal team warned that the \"adoption of a clearly erroneous jury instruction that entails a high probability of failure of prosecution\" would create an \"extraordinary situation\" and \"distort the trial.\"\n\nCannon made another highly favorable ruling for Trump in September 2022, ordering the appointment of an independent arbiter to review the more than 11,000 documents the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago before prosecutors could fully review the materials.\n\nThese moves are fueling Democrats' suspicions that Cannon is pushing a political agenda from the bench.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said Cannon bears responsibility for leaving legal questions unresolved for months, delaying the start of the trial.\n\n\"Why are they not resolved? Some of it's because she hasn't issued decisions on things that have already been briefed for a while,\" said Hirono, a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"I don't think that she's being objective. I think she has an ideological agenda. I also think that she's not very experienced in dealing with trials,\" she added. \"If there's a way that she can be reassigned, I certainly would support that.\"\n\nThe court for the Southern District of Florida does not list a phone number for Cannon's chambers while it does for other judges. A staff member at the court said Cannon would review any complaints submitted to her in writing via the mail.\n\nOther Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say there's little chance of removing Cannon from the case unless she voluntarily decides to recuse herself.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) called the lengthy delay \"truly unfortunate.\"\n\n\"There have been questions from the start as to whether or not she was up to the task of handling a complex case like this in a timely manner and even more serious questions as to whether her politics had anything to do with the rulings,\" he said.\n\nWho is Judge Cannon?\n\nCannon, who is 43, graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 2007 and worked for a corporate law firm before becoming an assistant federal prosecutor in Florida. She had limited trial experience and just met the American Bar Association's requirement of 12 years of legal practice when she was nominated.\n\nDurbin said Trump is \"entitled to his day in court\" and \"due process\" but emphasized \"a timely trial is important for the cause of justice.\"\n\nThe senior Democrat said it's unlikely Cannon could be removed from the case.\n\n\"I don't think that's a possibility. My understanding is there would have to be some effort to change venue, and she would be the first judge to rule on that,\" he said.\n\nWhitehouse said the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals could intervene but that it would be \"quite unusual.\"\n\nSen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Cannon's \"at it again, doing everything she can to delay.\"\n\nHe called it \"disappointing\" but \"not surprising.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee and former state attorney general, called the cancellation of the start of Trump's trial \"really regretful.\"\n\n\"It's denying justice to America,\" he said. \"I question whether this judge understands the magnitude or the legal import of this trial.\"\n\nBlumenthal said Smith could ask Cannon to recuse herself but expressed doubt he would risk adding to the tension with the judge.\n\n\"There is a procedure to seek recusal, but I also understand the reluctance of a litigant asking for recusal because it alienates the judge. It's a classic dilemma for justice that a particular judicial officer may be conducting a trial that could be better done by somebody else,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType":

Aileen Cannon, the Trump-appointed judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, has postponed the former (and perhaps future) president's classified documents trial, which had been set to begin on May 20, with no new date for its resumption. As Judge Cannon explained, \"The Court ... determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\" This doesn't mean Judge Cannon's courtroom will grind to a halt, though. On the contrary, she's scheduled a hearing for today, a hearing for May 20, and another for May 22 to hear defendant Waltine Nauta's motion to dismiss. In addition, as Fox News reports, she's \"scheduled deadlines for reports on May 31, June 10, June 17, and another nonevidentiary hearing on a motion to dismiss on June 21, 'based on unlawful appointment and funding of special counsel.'\" This, of course, is Hatchet Jack Smith's trial, and it's the one that legal experts believe most imperils the former president.

To receive it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's public defense of his four separate lawsuits in four separate jurisdictions is that it is a coordinated effort and political persecution, evidence, he says, of a double standard of justice.\n\nTrump's claim is refuted by the likelihood, which appears to be increasing this week, that three of the four criminal charges will not reach court before Election Day.\n\nThe other prosecution generally considered the weaker charge against Trump provided some salacious and embarrassing moments for the former president. But the facts of this New York case, focusing on his efforts to hide an alleged affair rather than his conduct as president or his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, seem to come from another era.\n\nIf Trump could fabricate a conspiracy theory out of the fact that separate grand juries in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C., all independently approved the charges against him, what would he think of the next series of events?\n\nIndictment: June 8, 2023, with a superseding indictment filed July 27, 2023.\n\nTrump named the judge in the Florida case, Aileen Cannon, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But Cannon has drawn anger from critics who see a slowness in the time she takes to issue decisions and a deference to Trump's requests to delay the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cannon crossed out the scheduled May trial date and did not set a new one. With many outstanding questions in the federal case, legal experts now doubt whether the trial in which special counsel Jack Smith alleges that Trump mishandled classified data he refused to turn over to the National Archives will take place before November.\n\nFormer Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb, now a Trump critic, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday night that Cannon has so far failed at trial.\n\nI think frankly his goal has always been to keep this case from going to trial, Cobb told Burnett. In the judges' slow work, Cobb sees a combination of bias and incompetence.\n\nThe other federal case, in which Smith accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and strip Americans of their democratic rights, is also pending in Washington, D.C., thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFirst, the justices declined to expedite consideration of Trump's dubious claim for absolute immunity from criminal prosecution, preferring instead to allow that claim to proceed through oral arguments before a panel of justices. a lower court.\n\nHowever, when that lower court rejected Trump's request for absolute immunity, the Supreme Court suddenly wanted to have a say. The conservative judges, three of whom were appointed by Trump, did not necessarily seem to buy into the more outlandish extremes of his argument during a hearing last month, such as the hypothetical scenario that Seal Team 6 was ordered to eliminate a political rival, but they were intrigued. enough to suggest that their decision will not simply allow the trial to move forward.\n\nWhenever they decide to release it, of course. Maybe June or July! Which would leave little time for a trial.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' relationship with a prosecutor shouldn't necessarily have anything to do with the allegations against Trump, which are linked to his efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. But the fallout from her decision to employ her former boyfriend helps her. Asset.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it will consider Trump's appeal of Judge Scott McAfees' decision to allow Willis to remain on the case.\n\nThe sordid details of Trump's alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels are nothing Trump wanted to see as he stared down Daniels in court Tuesday.\n\nTrump's lawyers could extend Daniels' cross-examination when the trial resumes Thursday as they seek to cast doubt on his credibility. This should be a preview of the upcoming trials between former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, an admitted liar and convicted felon, and lawyers for the boss Cohen says he broke campaign finance law for.\n\nThere may be a good reason why federal prosecutors dropped this case and decided not to pursue it.\n\nThe point here is that despite all of Trump's controversial actions as president and his clear attempt to change the election results, a conviction for falsifying business records, if it happens, may not be what will sway the few swing state voters who will decide this election. .\n\nTrump's lawsuits do not constitute a grand election interference conspiracy. They are part of a slow-moving justice in which it is useful to have the resources, thanks to donors, to pay an army of lawyers who can sully the works. Trump's long-standing strategy is to delay his trials, get elected, and then work to make them go away. From that point of view, it was a good week for him.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The district court judge has faced some criticism for being too Trump-friendly in pre-trial proceedings.\n\nIn an the order filed on Tuesday, Cannon wrote that the trial start date originally scheduled for May 20 is delayed in order to address issues concerning classified evidence that need to be resolved before the case can be presented before a jury. She did not set a new date.\n\nMorning Joe co-host Willie Geist asked Rubin on Wednesday if Cannon was \"slow walking\" the case.\n\n\"I think she is, but I also think based on some reporting from David Lat that this is a judge who is overwhelmed and is second-guessing herself at every corner,\" Rubin replied. \"She seems to be overwhelmed with anxiety about the import of the case.\"\n\nRubin continued: \"A combination of insecurity in your own decisions, the gravity of the case before you and maybe also some inclination to slow walk where you don't have trust in yourself -- that's a toxic brew and we're all drinking it right now.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida via email for comment, however, they said Cannon does not comment on pending cases.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal charges concerning allegations he illegally retained classified materials after he left the White House in January 2021 and then obstructed the federal attempt to retrieve them. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nCannon Afflicted with 'Anxiety' and 'Insecurity'\n\nLat, who Rubin mentioned on Morning Joe, is a lawyer and legal commentator. In a blog post titled Clerking For Judge Cannon: A Behind-The-Scenes Look on Substack from March, he quoted some of Cannon's early law clerks, who spoke anonymously, and he wrote that they had \"positive experiences\" working under her.\n\nHowever, he said this changed when she was assigned Trump's classified documents case.\n\n\"As the months passed, the stress and workload increased in chambers. Judge Cannon became afflicted with an unfortunate combination of anxiety, from handling a matter of national importance, and insecurity, from never having run a case of this complexity. Understandably affected by all the pressure, the judge -- whom her early clerks described as a wonderful mentor -- started to change. And not for the better,\" wrote Lat, who also spoke to unnamed law clerks who worked under Cannon post-Trump case.\n\nWhile Trump's classified documents trial is on hold, he is currently on trial in Manhattan for allegedly falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made during his 2016 presidential campaign to adult film actress Stormy Daniels over a rumored affair in the early 2000s. Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nHe also faces two other criminal indictments relating to election interference (one on the state level and one on the federal level). In both of those cases he has pleaded not guilty. Trump continues to say that all of the civil and criminal court actions he faces are politically motivated.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Geist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie Geist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389953/donald-trump.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=1ae13a5279d260c37df04e036f5edeec", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 395}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump, who has denied wrongdoing, is facing 40 federal felony charges in the case including willfully retaining national defense information, destroying evidence and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The charges' punishments range from five to up to 20 years in prison. The trial delay is welcome news for Trump, who has sought to delay his four criminal trials until after the election. If he wins the presidency, he would have the ability to bring in new prosecutors at the Department of Justice who could drop the federal charges against him. However, a trial for Trump's New York hush money case is already underway, with the former president facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records linked to alleged illegal reimbursement payments he made to his former attorney, Michael Cohen, who paid adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to cover up allegations she and Trump had an affair. Trial dates have still not been set for Trump's election interference case in Georgia and his federal Jan. 6 case.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nStormy Daniels Testifies About Alleged Night With Trump: 'Left As Fast As I Could' -- As Judge Denies Mistrial Bid (Live Updates) (Forbes)\n\nTrump May Have Signed Hush Money Checks From White House, Witness Testifies (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Why are 3 of Trump's 4 criminal trials delayed indefinitely? - KION546", "body": "(CNN) -- Former President Donald Trump's public defense against his four, distinct prosecutions in four, separate jurisdictions is that they are a coordinated hit job and a political persecution - evidence, he says, of a double standard of justice.\n\nDisproving Trump's allegation is the likelihood, which seems to be growing this week, that three of the four criminal prosecutions might not reach the courtroom before Election Day.\n\nThe other prosecution - generally seen as the weakest case against Trump - has provided salacious and embarrassing moments for the former president. But the facts of that case in New York, focused on his effort to hide an alleged affair rather than his conduct as president or his effort to overturn the 2020 election, feel like something from a different time.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases.\n\nIf Trump could manufacture a conspiracy theory out of the fact that separate grand juries in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, DC, all independently approved charges against him, what would he make of the following series of events?\n\nTrump appointed the judge in the Florida case, Aileen Cannon, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But Cannon has angered critics who see slow-walking in the length of time she takes to return decisions and pandering in her deference to Trump's requests to delay the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cannon scratched the planned May trial date and did not pencil in a new one. With multiple outstanding issues in the federal case, legal experts are now doubting the trial - in which special counsel Jack Smith alleges Trump mishandled classified data he refused to turn over to the National Archives - will occur before November.\n\nTrump's former White House counsel Ty Cobb, now a Trump critic, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday night that Cannon has so far failed in the trial.\n\n\"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" Cobb told Burnett. In the judge's slow work, Cobb sees \"a combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\nThe other federal case, in which Smith accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results and rob Americans of their democratic rights, is also on hold in Washington, DC, thanks to the US Supreme Court.\n\nFirst, justices refused to fast-track reviewing Trump's dubious claim of \"absolute immunity\" from criminal prosecution, instead preferring to allow that claim to proceed through oral arguments before a panel of judges in a lower court.\n\nWhen that lower court rejected Trump's absolute immunity claim, however, the Supreme Court suddenly wanted to have its say. Conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, seemed to not necessarily buy into the more outlandish extremes of his argument during a hearing last month - such as the hypothetical scenario of Seal Team 6 being ordered to take out a political rival - but they were intrigued enough to suggest their decision will not simply allow the trial to go forward.\n\nWhenever they get around to issuing it, that is. Could be June or July! Which would leave little time for a trial.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' relationship with a prosecutor shouldn't necessarily have anything to do with the allegations against Trump, which are related to his effort to overturn election results in Georgia in 2020. But the fallout of her decision to employ her former boyfriend is helping Trump.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it would consider Trump's appeal of Judge Scott McAfee's decision to allow Willis to remain on the case.\n\nThe tawdry details of Trump's alleged affair with adult-film star Stormy Daniels are nothing Trump wanted to see, as he stared Daniels down in court on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's lawyers may drag out the cross-examination of Daniels when the trial resumes on Thursday as they seek to impeach her credibility. That should be a preview of the trial's coming showdown between Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, an admitted liar and convicted felon, and attorneys for the boss for whom Cohen says he broke campaign finance law.\n\nThere may have been a good reason federal prosecutors passed on this case and decided not to pursue it.\n\nThe point here is that for all of Trump's controversial actions as president and his clear attempt to change election results, a conviction for falsifying business records, if it even comes, may not be what sways those few voters in swing states who will decide this election.\n\nTrump's prosecutions are no grand conspiracy of election interference. They're part of a slow-working justice system in which it helps to have the resources, thanks to donors, to pay an army of lawyers who can gum up the works. Trump's long-standing strategy is to delay his trials, get elected and then work to make them go away. From that perspective, this has been a good week for him.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

{"uri": "8119153410", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-09", "time": "12:53:55", "dateTime": "2024-05-09T12:53:55Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-09T12:43:12Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/legal-stalling-tactics-and-lucky-breaks-boost-trump-white-house-bid-1.2070838", "title": "Legal Stalling Tactics and Lucky Breaks Boost Trump White House Bid - BNN Bloomberg", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Delays in the classified documents case and the Georgia election interference charges against Donald Trump exposed a fundamental truth about the 2024 election: the legal system is not going to stymie the former president's political momentum as many once thought.\n\nWith just one of four possible trials certain to occur before Election Day in November, US voters will likely decide whether Joe Biden or Trump is president in 2025 without knowing the outcome of Trump's myriad legal challenges, including his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 attempted insurrection, or the charges that he knowingly hid classified government documents at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nPolitical operatives and legal veterans say the long list of trial delays -- affecting all but the hush-money trial underway in New York -- stem from a combination of Trump's luck, his lawyers' willingness to bend legal conventions and the slow-moving pace of the US judicial system. He also gets the benefit of speaking to a pool of television cameras every time he enters and exits the courtroom.\n\nSignificant postponements in three of his four criminal indictments raise the stakes for the ongoing trial in New York involving Trump's alleged falsification of business records to obfuscate hush-money payments to an adult film actress. The trial is expected to conclude sometime in June.\n\nA conviction could mean probation or prison time for Trump, which would hamper his ability to campaign. Trump can, however, appeal any conviction resulting from the hush-money case, meaning that any sentencing or prison time would also likely be pushed after the election.\n\nAnother boon for Trump: the New York case is arguably the least serious of all four, both in terms of political damage and possible legal punishment, said Jon Sale, a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. The downside: the witnesses in the case are recounting salacious details about the sex life of the former president and his relationship with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump has denied a sexual relationship with her.\n\n\"Trump is a master at denial and delay,\" said long-time Republican pollster Whit Ayres. \"He's got a lot of experience with it, but he also has a Justice Department that waited a long time to get serious about prosecuting\" the documents case, he said.\n\nJust this week, two rulings broke in Trump's favor. On Tuesday, Judge Aileen Cannon in the Florida documents case indefinitely postponed the trial, which was initially set to begin May 20. A Georgia court on Wednesday agreed to hear arguments in Trump's appeal to remove District Attorney Fani Willis from the election interference case, which will likely result in a significant delay. Another case also involving Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election was cruising toward a trial this year, but got bogged down in February by the Supreme Court's review of Trump's immunity argument.\n\n\"President Trump and his team will continue to fight these unconstitutional hoaxes in the courts and the American People will ultimately hold Crooked Joe and his comrades to account this Fall,\" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.\n\nCampaign Trail\n\nThe lack of courtroom commitments is also an unexpected benefit for Trump's campaign aides, who had long planned for the presumptive Republican nominee to spend months on trial and off the traditional campaign trail. Now, Trump could be free to spend much more time holding rallies, attending fundraisers or meeting with advisers and supporters.\n\nThere is \"no doubt\" Trump's strategy toward handling the cases has been successful, both legally and politically, Sale said. But it will only remain successful if Trump wins the election, he added.\n\n\"It was the political strategy to delay and it turned out the different events in the different legal arenas coincided with the legal strategy,\" said Sale, who was asked early on to join Trump's legal team but declined.\n\nThe lack of trials proceeding before November goes a long way to neuter one of the key challenges for Trump: 53% of swing state voters say they would be unwilling to vote for Trump if he were convicted of a crime and 55% if he were sentenced to prison, according to a January Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of voters in seven battleground states.\n\nTrump has benefited from a combination of his legal strategy to delay court proceedings along with the unique circumstances of each case, said Mary McCord, a former federal prosecutor and acting head of the Justice Department's national security division.\n\nDocuments Case\n\nThe classified documents case could have gone to trial this year had it not been for the federal judge overseeing the case giving air to Trump's stalling tactics, she said.\n\nPolitical operatives widely believe that case could be the most damaging to Trump. Ayres, the pollster, called that case as \"strong as battery acid.\"\n\n\"If any of us had done what Trump had done with the documents, not only would we be indicted now, we would be in jail,\" he said.\n\nMcCord, who is now executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center, said a different judge may have stuck to the schedule and \"not been so accommodating to Trump\" on the classified documents case.\n\n\"It's been a combination of the legal strategy, which is delay, and then certain courts and certain actions by some of the courts that have allowed that strategy to be successful,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are some of the things. This is TPM's Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nYou've already seen the top line from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's new order yesterday: She is indefinitely delaying the trial of Donald Trump on charges he improperly retained classified documents post-presidency and obstructed justice to cover it up. But there were at least three headline-worthy decisions in the order. Let's run through them:\n\n1. Indefinite Delay. Cannon struck the May 20 trial date, but she didn't set a new one and has no immediate plans to do so. She said she won't set one until various pretrial matters are resolved and laid out a schedule that won't resolve them until late July at the earliest. This comes even though she'd previously asked the parties to brief her on trial date options, which they had done. Her rationales for delaying the trial indefinitely were a mishmash of reasons she herself has created. Cannon has let pretrial motions linger unruled upon for months and has repeatedly pushed back the CIPA process. It's been obvious for weeks that she's gummed up the proceedings, and now she's using that as an excuse for further delay.\n\n2. Cannon is treating inane Trump claims as credible. Perhaps the most remarkable decision Cannon made in the order was to devote three days in June to an evidentiary hearing on Trump's claim that the prosecution team should be defined to include the White House, the intelligence community, and your Aunt Marge. It's a preposterous claim that Cannon is taking seriously. Ruling in favor of Trump would set a mind-boggling precedent in general, but in particular it would open up vast areas of the federal government to Trump discovery requests that would further delay the case, muddy the waters, and give fodder to hare-brained conspiracy theories about the Deep State targeting Trump.\n\n3. Cannon is in over her head. Trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Cannon - and it seems to have worked. In her new order, she bemoaned the scale of the case, the amount of discovery, and the sheer volume of issues to be resolved. Those aren't accurate descriptions of the case, but they are how Trump has described it to her. In adopting Trump's language, she also claimed that the case presents \"novel and difficult questions,\" which is simply not the case.\n\nEvery time I write about the latest corrupt mishandling of the Mar-a-Lago case by Judge Cannon, readers reach out wanting to know why nothing is being done about it. Why hasn't Special Counsel Jack Smith tried to have her removed? Why hasn't he appealed? Why hasn't the appeals court stepped in?\n\nI have reasoned explanations for each of those questions, but they aren't satisfying answers. Is the system fundamentally rotten and broken? Maybe. It's clearly failing in this case to do justice in a timely manner.\n\nThe next questions are often about Cannon herself. Is she personally corrupt, incompetent, naive and inexperienced? Some measure of all of the above.\n\nThe full liveblog that Josh Kovensky did for us yesterday is worth a read to give you the warp and weft of Stormy Daniels' direct testimony and the first stab at cross-examining her. His end-of-the-day recap is a condensed version if you're short on time.\n\nA few highlights from the day:\n\nNo trial today. It resumes Thursday with the continuation of the cross examination of Daniels. We'll have another liveblog running via Josh in the courthouse.\n\nJill Filipovic at The Atlantic:", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking Points Memo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_kurtz@talkingpointsmemo.com", "name": "David Kurtz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Points_Memo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talking Points Memo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_within_a_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State within a state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Filipovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Filipovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aileen-cannon-shielding-trump.jpg?w=804", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 515}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

But for all of his grimacing and whining about how unfair the whole ordeal is, the former president should consider himself lucky: In every other case against him, Trump is getting all the breaks.\n\nThe most recent came Tuesday, when Aileen Cannon -- the Trump-appointed Florida judge who was confirmed in the final months of his presidency -- announced she was indefinitely postponing the start of his classified documents trial. The delay is apparently necessary to resolve numerous legal questions she herself allowed to \"build up on her docket,\" as the New York Times' Alan Feuer put it recently. \"Finalization of a trial date at this juncture...would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court,\" Cannon wrote in an order Tuesday, also citing issues with the Classified Information Procedures Act and \"additional pretrial and trial preparations\" in her decision.\n\nCannon's move could make it less likely that the case, which was scheduled to begin on May 20, will make it to trial before the November election. And, in the event that Trump reclaims the White House from Biden -- whom he's baselessly accused of masterminding the criminal cases he's wrapped up in -- it's safe to assume that the former president will attempt to put an end to many of them. Perhaps highest on his hit list would be Jack Smith's election interference case, which is also being subjected to the Trump team's textbook delay tactics -- and threatened by the Supreme Court, whose conservative members seem to be seriously entertaining the former president's outrageous claims to presidential immunity. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's state election subversion case could be further upended after an appeals court Wednesday agreed to consider Trump's request to have her disqualified over her romantic relationship with one of her prosecutors -- a move that could delay, if not entirely derail, that prosecution.\n\nTrump hasn't had as much luck in Alvin Bragg's felony case against him in Manhattan, where the former president's outbursts in defiance of his gag order have already led to fines and could lead to time in jail. But it's unclear how much time behind bars, if any, Trump would face if the Manhattan jury ultimately finds him guilty in the case, which -- while historic -- is regarded as less severe than the other three.\n\nThis isn't to say that Bragg's case doesn't matter: According to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll, a fifth of self-identified Trump supporters say they would either reconsider or withdraw their support from him in the election if he's convicted -- somewhat undercutting the image of political invincibility he tries to project. But that only underscores the fact that if Trump is going to face accountability this year, it will likely have to come at the ballot box -- not only in a courtroom.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/663b96184049ac4cdb4b2f40/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/2151947046?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1419, "textEnd": 1425}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

With Judge Aileen Cannon, Maybe Both", "body": "Okay, it's a complicated case, but this is getting ridiculous. I read the five-page order by Judge Aileen Cannon delaying Donald Trump's classified documents case, so you don't have to. You may not be able to remember back far enough to recall what this criminal prosecution is about, so here's a brief summary.\n\nDonald Trump literally had a Hertz rental truck pulled up next to the White House on January 20, 2021 so he could have his aides load dozens of boxes of documents he was taking with him to Mar-a-Lago in violation of the Presidential Records Act, which makes all records and documents produced during a president's time in office the property of the government.\n\nWhen later that year, the National Archives contacted Trump and demanded the return of the documents, he stalled, making all sorts of claims that the documents were his private property. The National Archives had to threaten to go to the Department of Justice for Trump to turn over 15 boxes of presidential records in January of 2022. In the 15 boxes, the National Archives found a trove of top-secret documents, and going through them, determined that it was likely that more classified documents were missing and demanded those, too.\n\nTrump stalled again, finally agreeing to turn over some classified documents to lawyers for the DOJ in June of 2022. But before the DOJ lawyers arrived at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had his \"body man\" aide, Walt Nauta, move boxes of classified documents all around the Palm Beach property so (1) his own lawyer couldn't find them when he did a \"due diligence\" search, and (2) the DOJ couldn't find them when they showed up in June to collect the few documents Trump was turning over.\n\nThe DOJ analyzed the top-secret documents in the stash Trump turned over, and they interviewed witnesses from Mar-a-Lago, and determined that there were likely more documents stored there. They got a warrant and searched the place on August 8, and discovered more than 100 additional top-secret documents, some of them regarding secrets about the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith was appointed to investigate Trump, and in the summer of 2023, Trump was indicted on 40 felony charges of stealing and mishandling government documents, including national security information.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Cannon, and she started stalling, issuing several bogus rulings on motions by the defense that were overturned on appeal to the 11 Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Then she continued to stall, as Trump's lawyers filed one motion after another to delay the case.\n\nNow here we are in the spring of 2024, more than four years after the National Archives demanded the return of the documents Trump stole, and Judge Cannon, with legal shovel in hand, has dug yet another trench in the warfare that she and Trump's lawyers have been waging against Special Counsel Smith. They're trying to wait out the campaign season, so Trump doesn't go to trial before the election and get convicted, because they know the evidence is against them. He did take the top-secret documents. He did store them in a ballroom and bathroom and inside his own office at Mar-a-Lago. He did move some of them to his golf club in New Jersey. They've got the documents, they've got video taped evidence of the movement of the boxes within Mar-a-Lago, they've got testimony by Mar-a-Lago employees that they were acting on Trump's orders.\n\nThey've got him.\n\nBut they've also got Judge \"I'm just a little 'ole MAGA girl from Florida\" Cannon, and she issued an order today that's a doozy. She is going to hold a hearing on every single motion Trump has filed right up to and including a request to go to the bathroom. Here are some of the hearings Cannon says must take place before she can even schedule a trial date:\n\nNon-Evidentiary Hearing on Defendant Nauta's Motion to Dismiss for Selective and Vindictive Prosecution May 22\n\nNon-Evidentiary Hearing on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Indictment for Insufficient Pleading May 22\n\nDiscovery Status Reports (Special Counsel; Consolidated Defense) May 31, 2024\n\nNon-Evidentiary Hearing on Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel June 21\n\nPartial Evidentiary Hearing on Defendants' Consolidated Motions to Compel Discovery and to Define Scope of Prosecution Team June 24-26\n\nSpecial Counsel's Supplemental Expert Disclosures (if any) July 9\n\nSpecial Counsel's CIPA \u00a7 6(a) Defense Reciprocal Discovery July 10\n\nNow listen to her: \"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court...Finally, the Court has evaluated the statutory factors set forth in the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(B), including the public's interest in the efficient administration of justice. Upon such review, the Court finds that the ends of justice served by this continuance, through the last deadline specified in this Order, July 22, 2024, outweigh the best interest of the public and Defendants in a speedy trial.\"\n\nGot that? Judge \"I had to use spellcheck on the word 'speedy'\" Cannon has allowed Trump and Nauta and any wino wandering in off the street in Fort Pierce, Florida, to file any motion they wanted for more than a year, and now she has determined that Donald Trump won't go on trial until a fucking rooster crows somewhere on an icy peninsula in Outer Mongolia because...uh...let me check my first year law school notes here...\"the ends of justice\" command it so.\n\nI've got two words for you: Mitch McConnell. He's the right-wing double-dealing backstabber who put two justices on the Supreme Court by violating rules he, himself, had set, and he's the Federalist Society sock puppet who put AI bots like Aileen Cannon on the federal bench so she could look after the interests of the Republican Party and any flaming asshole they decided to run for president, right up to and including Donald \"Excuse me while I expel a fart and pee in my diaper\" Trump.\n\nBenjamin Franklin said we've got a Republic if we can keep it. This isn't what Franklin had in mind. This is throwing everything generations of Americans have fought and lost their lives to defend out with the trash.", "source": {"uri": "nationalmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National

Perlstein, a Los Angeles-based litigation attorney, said that there were significant issues in handling the classified documents at the center of the indictment and therefore the case needed considerable time.\n\nHe said the delay is \"not surprising because the judge is a Trump appointee and in addition there are some significant legal issues involving the classified documents that will need hearings thus the case will take time.\"\n\nRelated Articles", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o\u2019driscoll@theolympian.com", "name": "Sean O\u2019Driscoll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mandamus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/l4z3a9/picture288412049/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3acec057-cc18-4e9d-801d-322255c452fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

After a pair of delays this week in Georgia and Florida, the most likely scenario for 2024 is that the only trial that Trump will face before the election is the ongoing one in Manhattan: the hush money case, which many lawyers view as the least serious of the four, both in terms of the severity of the alleged wrongdoing and the prospect of prison time.\n\nAnd if that scenario comes to pass, Trump's critics will be deprived of the teaching moment they have long hoped for: some methodical public airing of the former president's gravest misdeeds that would convince some swath of Trump supporters to rule out supporting him.\n\n\"I do think people had too high hopes for these cases to take the place of grass-roots organization and self-education and voting rights and getting people to the polls and basically having a more fundamental and a real conversation about what we are facing now in under 200 days,\" said University of Baltimore law professor Kimberly Wehle, a former assistant U.S. attorney. \"I just thought courts were the last thing standing.\"\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive that the broader legal threat against Trump is receding as the former president is being forced to report to a New York City courtroom most weekdays for his hush money trial. That case, in which he is accused of falsifying business records, is historic in its own right, and Manhattan prosecutors have framed the allegations as a form of election interference.\n\nHowever, in the span of less than 24 hours this week, the already-modest chances of Trump facing any other trials in the next six months diminished further.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the Trump-appointed judge in Florida overseeing his prosecution on charges of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing the federal investigation into them, postponed that trial indefinitely, citing a slew of pending motions and special procedures related to handling of classified evidence in court.\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to take up the ex-president's bid to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from proceeding with her case charging Trump with leading a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election in that state. That move likely means months more delay in the case, where no trial date has been set for Trump or his 14 co-defendants.\n\nThat leaves the fourth, and arguably most serious, case: the federal charges in Washington for conspiring to derail the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden. That case had been scheduled to go to trial two months ago, but it, too, has been on hold. The Supreme Court froze the proceedings in the trial court by agreeing to hear Trump's appeal claiming presidential immunity. Oral arguments last month signaled the justices may order the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, to conduct a painstaking, and time-consuming, review of the charges and evidence before conducting any trial.\n\nA decision from the Supreme Court may not come until the end of June. If the justices don't kill the case against Trump entirely, it may limp on as the lower courts wrestle with how to apply whatever immunity the justices decide former presidents enjoy. And even if the case is ready to proceed to trial by late summer or fall, it's unclear whether Chutkan, an Obama appointee, would contemplate holding a trial for Trump in the nation's capital at the height of the presidential campaign while Trump is seeking to win back the White House.\n\nThe frustration with the pace of court action in the Trump cases has prompted some liberal commentators to seize on the possibility that, with the clock running out before the election, Chutkan might hold a wide-ranging evidentiary hearing with witnesses who could publicly air Trump's varied efforts to upend the 2020 election. The formal purpose of such a hearing would be for the judge to consider whether those efforts were related to his presidential duties or done in service of personal or political ends. But, for some critics, it might also be the only chance at public accountability before voters head to the polls.\n\n\"It delays the trial on the one hand but, on the other hand, that could be the opportunity for some of the government's evidence, the meticulous work that [special counsel] Jack Smith did in front of the grand jury, that could soon become something that Americans are conversant with. We have an opportunity to see more of the evidence against Donald Trump,\" former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said on MSNBC.\n\nWhile such a mini-trial might generate some new insights and could divert Trump from the campaign trail, it seems unlikely to generate the kind of drama of an actual trial before a jury. It's also unclear how much political impact such a hearing would have given that so much of Trump's actions in the lead-up to Jan. 6, 2021, have already been exposed during the hearings a House select committee held in 2022 on his effort to undermine the election results and halt the Congress' counting of electoral votes.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

She spent weeks considering idiotic motions and holding hearings on such thorny issues as \"should the Mar-a-Lago groundskeeper who is charged with obstructing the grand jury be allowed to see the highly classified evidence his boss stole.\"\n\nSpoiler alert: No.\n\nBut yesterday she made it official, taking the stolen documents case off the trial calendar entirely.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and [Classified Informations Procedures Act] issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" she wrote.\n\nCiting the evidentiary issues under CIPA which she herself has failed to rule on as a reason this case can't go forward is pretty ballsy. On November 3, Judge Cannon stayed the November 15 deadline, scheduling a hearing for March 1 to argue about scheduling, and then, after the hearing, taking an additional 40 days to set a new deadline of May 9.\n\nAs Lawfare's Roger Parloff notes, Trump immediately turned around and asked for further delay, which put the jurist in the awkward position of having to either \"reverse herself a week later with no change in circumstances\" or \"deny Trump something he really wants.\" But of course she chose the former, taking as a figleaf Trump's feigned indignation that the stolen government documents may have gotten shuffled around in the boxes as they were being removed by the FBI, because the order of said documents \"constituted exculpatory information relating to, inter alia, the complete absence of culpable criminal intent by President Trump.\"\n\nIn her most recent order, officially removing the May 20 trial date from the calendar, Judge Cannon also cited the \"currently pending motions, which now consist of eight substantive pretrial motions,\" \"extensive defense motions to compel discovery on a host of issues spanning hundreds of pages of classified and unclassified briefing,\" as well as Trump's motion demanding to treat the entire executive branch, including the White House Counsel's Office, as part of the prosecution team for discovery purposes.\n\nIn other words, she's let Trump and his henchmen spam the docket with garbage motions, been totally dilatory in ruling on them, and is now allowing the defendants to reap the reward from their bad faith behavior by postponing the trial. She's even set a hearing for June 21 on the Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel, a throwaway argument being bruited about by Ed Meese and Stephen Calabresi in the various Trump cases, but curiously absent when it comes to David Weiss and John Durham, i.e. the special counsels they like.\n\nLuckily, the nation's greatest legal mind is on the case!

On Tuesday, she announced the indefinite postponement of Trump's trial, where he faces charges related to the illegal retention of classified documents after his presidency ended.\n\nOriginally scheduled to commence on May 20, the trial in the documents case, brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, was anticipated to begin. However, both the prosecution and defense teams acknowledged the necessity for postponement, prompting Judge Cannon's ruling.\n\nJudge Cannon, appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, confirmed the trial's postponement without specifying a new date. Instead, she scheduled pre-trial hearings to continue through July 22, indicating the prolonged legal process ahead.\n\nTrump, who has entered a plea of not guilty to 40 federal counts, stands accused of retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021. Furthermore, he is accused of obstructing US government efforts to retrieve these documents. Facing these charges amid his aspirations for political comeback, Trump encounters significant legal hurdles.\n\nALSO READ :Vladimir Putin Takes Oath For Fifth Presidential Term, Setting Record In Russia\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith faces formidable challenges in bringing either federal case against Trump to trial before upcoming elections. Judge Cannon's rulings on crucial legal matters in the documents case remain pending, with indications of support for Trump's defense on certain issues.\n\nTrump's legal team has advocated for a trial date after the elections, although they proposed August 12 as an alternative to Judge Cannon's request for a proposed timeline. Smith, however, suggested a July start date, highlighting the urgency of the legal proceedings.\n\nCommenting on the unprecedented circumstances, Randall Eliason, a law professor at George Washington University, emphasized the unusual predicament where a defendant could potentially influence the fate of their prosecution. Eliason stressed the importance of expediting the trial before the elections, given the implications for the electoral landscape.\n\nIn addition to the federal cases, Trump is concurrently facing legal battles in New York state court over charges related to concealing hush money paid to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN --\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's public defense against his four, distinct prosecutions in four, separate jurisdictions is that they are a coordinated hit job and a political persecution - evidence, he says, of a double standard of justice.\n\nDisproving Trump's allegation is the likelihood, which seems to be growing this week, that three of the four criminal prosecutions might not reach the courtroom before Election Day.\n\nThe other prosecution - generally seen as the weakest case against Trump - has provided salacious and embarrassing moments for the former president. But the facts of that case in New York, focused on his effort to hide an alleged affair rather than his conduct as president or his effort to overturn the 2020 election, feel like something from a different time.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases.\n\nIf Trump could manufacture a conspiracy theory out of the fact that separate grand juries in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, DC, all independently approved charges against him, what would he make of the following series of events?\n\nClassified documents case postponed indefinitely\n\nIndictment: June 8, 2023, with a superseding indictment filed July 27, 2023.\n\nTrial date: Delayed indefinitely.\n\nTrump appointed the judge in the Florida case, Aileen Cannon, which doesn't necessarily mean anything. But Cannon has angered critics who see slow-walking in the length of time she takes to return decisions and pandering in her deference to Trump's requests to delay the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cannon scratched the planned May trial date and did not pencil in a new one. With multiple outstanding issues in the federal case, legal experts are now doubting the trial - in which special counsel Jack Smith alleges Trump mishandled classified data he refused to turn over to the National Archives - will occur before November.\n\nTrump's former White House counsel Ty Cobb, now a Trump critic, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday night that Cannon has so far failed in the trial.\n\n\"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" Cobb told Burnett. In the judge's slow work, Cobb sees \"a combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's slow schedule is helping Trump\n\nIndictment: August 1, 2023.\n\nTrial date: Delayed indefinitely.\n\nThe other federal case, in which Smith accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results and rob Americans of their democratic rights, is also on hold in Washington, DC, thanks to the US Supreme Court.\n\nFirst, justices refused to fast-track reviewing Trump's dubious claim of \"absolute immunity\" from criminal prosecution, instead preferring to allow that claim to proceed through oral arguments before a panel of judges in a lower court.\n\nWhen that lower court rejected Trump's absolute immunity claim, however, the Supreme Court suddenly wanted to have its say. Conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, seemed to not necessarily buy into the more outlandish extremes of his argument during a hearing last month - such as the hypothetical scenario of Seal Team 6 being ordered to take out a political rival - but they were intrigued enough to suggest their decision will not simply allow the trial to go forward.\n\nWhenever they get around to issuing it, that is. Could be June or July! Which would leave little time for a trial.\n\nTrump's effort to disqualify the prosecutor in Georgia continues\n\nIndictment: August 14, 2023.\n\nTrial date: Delayed indefinitely.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' relationship with a prosecutor shouldn't necessarily have anything to do with the allegations against Trump, which are related to his effort to overturn election results in Georgia in 2020. But the fallout of her decision to employ her former boyfriend is helping Trump.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it would consider Trump's appeal of Judge Scott McAfee's decision to allow Willis to remain on the case.\n\nThe New York Case is salacious, but where does it lead?\n\nIndictment: Unsealed April 4, 2023.\n\nTrial: Ongoing.\n\nThe tawdry details of Trump's alleged affair with adult-film star Stormy Daniels are nothing Trump wanted to see, as he stared Daniels down in court on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's lawyers may drag out the cross-examination of Daniels when the trial resumes on Thursday as they seek to impeach her credibility. That should be a preview of the trial's coming showdown between Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, an admitted liar and convicted felon, and attorneys for the boss for whom Cohen says he broke campaign finance law.\n\nThere may have been a good reason federal prosecutors passed on this case and decided not to pursue it.\n\nThe point here is that for all of Trump's controversial actions as president and his clear attempt to change election results, a conviction for falsifying business records, if it even comes, may not be what sways those few voters in swing states who will decide this election.\n\nTrump's prosecutions are no grand conspiracy of election interference. They're part of a slow-working justice system in which it helps to have the resources, thanks to donors, to pay an army of lawyers who can gum up the works. Trump's long-standing strategy is to delay his trials, get elected and then work to make them go away. From that perspective, this has been a good week for him.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_b_wolf@cnn.com", "name": "Zachary B.

Section 5 of CIPA pertains to what classified information that defendants in criminal proceedings plan to disclose in a trial ahead of time to both the government and the court. Cannon's ruling notably did not set a new deadline.\n\nIn a tweet responding to the news of Cannon's order, former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance wrote that the latest news means that the case, which \"should have been ready to try by the end of last year,\" is now in serious jeopardy.\n\n\"Extending the 5(a) deadlines indefinitely is the same thing as giving Trump an indefinite trial delay,\" Vance tweeted.\n\nTrump's lawyers have maintained that Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith's team of prosecutors unlawfully manipulated the boxes of documents after the FBI seized them from Mar-a-Lago. Smith admitted last week that some of the documents shifted while being transported and that some had been reordered as a result.\n\nIn a letter, Trump attorney Todd Blanche accused Smith of an \"extraordinary breach of your constitutional and ethical obligations.\" But prosecutors countered that the reordering of the documents was insignificant, and that while handlers \"took care to ensure that no documents were moved from one box to another,\" they were \"not focused on maintaining the sequence of documents within each box.\"\n\nTrump body man Walt Nauta, who is also indicted in the Mar-a-Lago case, has been trying to delay his Section 5 CIPA deadline as well. However, according to the Hill, the prosecution argued that his objections lodged in the pre-trial process are irrelevant, given the amount of time he's had to raise concerns.\n\n\"[Nauta] has had information about which classified documents are located in which boxes for months, and failed to raise with the Government his current 'issue' about intra-box sequencing until over nine months after the boxes were made available to him,\" prosecutors said.\n\nCannon initially scheduled the classified documents trial to take place on May 20. However, the ongoing issues pertaining to CIPA Section 5 alone could take months to resolve. Last month, Smith indicated he may petition the 11th Circuit to have a new judge assigned to the case given Cannon's continuous pattern of delaying and prolonging the pre-trial process.", "source": {"uri": "smirkingchimp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Smirking Chimp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_&_Imaging_Products_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camera & Imaging Products Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_Information_Procedures_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified Information Procedures Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joyce Vance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=51862408&width=1245&height=700&quality=85&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2441, "textEnd": 2447}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, Cobb had some sharp words for the judge and her actions.\n\n\"all she's really done today, though, is make official what everybody, including jack smith, already knew, which was she had no intention of getting this case to trial,\" cobb told Burnett on Tuesday.\n\nCannon issued the order Tuesday, less than two weeks before Trump's trial was due to start on May 20, Mediaite reports. The order delays some of the case's court dates until late July and does not set a new date for the trial to begin.\n\nTrump is under the gun for what Special Counsel Jack Smith describes as his willful retention of classified documents after he left office. Trump, as per usual, because he's pure as the yellow snow, is pleading not guilty.\n\nBecause that's what he always does -- play the victim. Even though everyone but the dimmest Trump supporters understands he's not the victim here.\n\nBy vacating the May 20 trial date, Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020 has once again drawn Cobb's ire. He's long been one of her detractors for the way she has handled the case.\n\nThe judge said she delayed the trial because there were still numerous issues to be resolved. This includes how the classified information would be handled at trial since these details are governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA). She also claimed she still has \"eight substantive pretrial motions\" she has to rule on, but Cobb does not buy any of this, The Hill reports.\n\n\"so, you know, this is something that i think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" cobb said, per mediaite. \"but also, i think, you know, her ... inability, wholesale inability, to do it was made palpable.\"\n\nCobb, who received his A.B. from Harvard University, and J.D. from Georgetown Law School, lit into Cannon, describing her decision to kick the trial down the road was a \"combination of bias and incompetence.\" Her decisions, like scheduling a hearing centered around the Justice Department's trial team, are \"really inexplicable\" and \"tragic.\"\n\n\"she has not honored the public's interest for one day in this case, as she has sat in her office, apparently paralyzed from ruling on easily resolvable motions, and sadly, this case will not go to trial, notwithstanding the fact it's one of the most important cases in history and could have easily been tried in advance of the election,\" cobb said.\n\nAt one point Burnett asked, \"Does Jack Smith have any recourse on this? Or is this case closed?\"\n\nCobb was not optimistic.\n\n\"I don't think he would have the ability to get her removed on this or overruled on this,\" he explained. \"i do think she is not capable of ruling intelligently or fairly on most of the motions that will be pending, and certainly the classified information issues. and i think at some point she will be removed in advance of trial. but keep in mind, this case now can't go to trial until mid to late 2025. And it won't go to trial if trump is elected.\"\n\nI don't understand enough about legal proceedings in cases like this.

After a pair of delays this week in Georgia and Florida, the most likely scenario for 2024 is that the only trial that Trump will face before the election is the ongoing one in Manhattan: the hush money case, which many lawyers view as the least serious of the four, both in terms of the severity of the alleged wrongdoing and the prospect of prison time.\n\nAnd if that scenario comes to pass, Trump's critics will be deprived of the teaching moment they have long hoped for: some methodical public airing of the former president's gravest misdeeds that would convince some swath of Trump supporters to rule out supporting him.\n\n\"I do think people had too high hopes for these cases to take the place of grass-roots organization and self-education and voting rights and getting people to the polls and basically having a more fundamental and a real conversation about what we are facing now in under 200 days,\" said University of Baltimore law professor Kimberly Wehle, a former assistant U.S. attorney. \"I just thought courts were the last thing standing.\"\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive that the broader legal threat against Trump is receding as the former president is being forced to report to a New York City courtroom most weekdays for his hush money trial. That case, in which he is accused of falsifying business records, is historic in its own right, and Manhattan prosecutors have framed the allegations as a form of election interference.\n\nHowever, in the span of less than 24 hours this week, the already-modest chances of Trump facing any other trials in the next six months diminished further.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the Trump-appointed judge in Florida overseeing his prosecution on charges of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing the federal investigation into them, postponed that trial indefinitely, citing a slew of pending motions and special procedures related to handling of classified evidence in court.\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to take up the ex-president's bid to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from proceeding with her case charging Trump with leading a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election in that state. That move likely means months more delay in the case, where no trial date has been set for Trump or his 14 co-defendants.\n\nThat leaves the fourth, and arguably most serious, case: the federal charges in Washington for conspiring to derail the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden. That case had been scheduled to go to trial two months ago, but it, too, has been on hold. The Supreme Court froze the proceedings in the trial court by agreeing to hear Trump's appeal claiming presidential immunity. Oral arguments last month signaled the justices may order the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, to conduct a painstaking, and time-consuming, review of the charges and evidence before conducting any trial.\n\nA decision from the Supreme Court may not come until the end of June. If the justices don't kill the case against Trump entirely, it may limp on as the lower courts wrestle with how to apply whatever immunity the justices decide former presidents enjoy. And even if the case is ready to proceed to trial by late summer or fall, it's unclear whether Chutkan, an Obama appointee, would contemplate holding a trial for Trump in the nation's capital at the height of the presidential campaign while Trump is seeking to win back the White House.\n\nThe frustration with the pace of court action in the Trump cases has prompted some liberal commentators to seize on the possibility that, with the clock running out before the election, Chutkan might hold a wide-ranging evidentiary hearing with witnesses who could publicly air Trump's varied efforts to upend the 2020 election. The formal purpose of such a hearing would be for the judge to consider whether those efforts were related to his presidential duties or done in service of personal or political ends. But, for some critics, it might also be the only chance at public accountability before voters head to the polls.\n\n\"It delays the trial on the one hand but, on the other hand, that could be the opportunity for some of the government's evidence, the meticulous work that [special counsel] Jack Smith did in front of the grand jury, that could soon become something that Americans are conversant with. We have an opportunity to see more of the evidence against Donald Trump,\" former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said on MSNBC.\n\nWhile such a mini-trial might generate some new insights and could divert Trump from the campaign trail, it seems unlikely to generate the kind of drama of an actual trial before a jury. It's also unclear how much political impact such a hearing would have given that so much of Trump's actions in the lead-up to Jan. 6, 2021, have already been exposed during the hearings a House select committee held in 2022 on his effort to undermine the election results and halt the Congress' counting of electoral votes.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"},

Such litigation will continue through July 22 according to the judge's new calendar, which lists several major hearings.\n\nPresident Trump was charged with 40 counts related to allegedly mishandling classified information. His valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira were charged alongside him as codefendants.\n\nAdding to the classified information issues, President Trump is currently on trial in New York where prosecutors estimate needing up to three more weeks to present their case, and he is required to be present during the trial. If defense attorneys call additional witnesses, it may add to the trial length in New York.\n\nJudge Cannon did not set a new trial date in the order, finding it premature.\n\nShe wrote that to set a date now before resolving the \"myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA [Classified Information Procedures Act] issues\" would not be fair or prudent.\n\nThe judge still has before her several motions to dismiss charges or the indictment entirely, motions to unseal information the defendants argue are critical in the case, and ongoing discovery issues to resolve.\n\nOn May 22, the court will hold a hearing on Mr. Nauta's motion to dismiss the indictment for selective and vindictive prosecution, a motion that was just recently unsealed.

Bush ethics czar Richard Painter commented that this was the fear he and colleagues Norm Eisen and Fred Wertheimer had last year when they asked for Cannon to be recused before the process began.\n\n\"A competent and unbiased judge would have tried this case to verdict already,\" lawyer George Conway agreed.\n\nMSNBC's legal analyst Lisa Rubin said Wednesday that if special counsel Jack Smith wants to recuse her from the case, \"His best option is to wait for a substantive decision on an issue like Trump's motion to compel additional discoveries to support a selective or vindictive prosecution, motion to dismiss, that's sort of a motion in search of a bases,\"\n\n\"Most judges say, well, wait a second, if you can't support that on your own, I'm not going to give you lots of extra discovery so you can try and attack the Department of Justice and say it is clear prosecutors have vindictively prosecuted you, and yet Aileen Cannon seems to be leaning in that direction or veering toward it,\" Rubin continued.\n\n\"If that happens, or another decision on a motion to dismiss that he really disagrees with, count on him to appeal, but also to potentially ask the 11th circuit for the first time to recuse her from the case.\"\n\nTrump was charged under the Espionage Act and has pleaded not guilty.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Kirschner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Kirschner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Act_of_1954", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atomic Energy Act of 1954"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norm Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Cannon said there were eight outstanding substantive pending motions for her to rule on and predicted it will take until at least late July.\n\n\"Jack Smith is clearly frustrated, but seeking to remove a judge or overturn a scheduling order would not be easy,\" Germain told Newsweek.\n\nGermain said that as Cannon's suspension is interlocutory, or done provisionally, there is no right for Smith to appeal.\n\n\"He could file an interlocutory appeal request, but it would be up to the appellate court whether they would hear it,\" Germain said. \"It would be very hard to overturn a scheduling order because courts have broad control over their own calendars.\"\n\nJudges make interlocutory orders during a court proceeding and are not final, so they cannot be appealed.\n\nGermain added that there are \"serious questions about whether Judge Cannon is biased or incompetent.\"\n\nCannon's ruling effectively spoiled Smith's effort to start the trial before the November election, a priority for Democrats and even some Republicans who say they would like to know the outcome of the cases against Trump -- the presumptive GOP presidential nominee -- before they vote.\n\nCannon is overseeing the case in which Trump is accused of illegally retaining classified documents, hoarding them at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and obstructing attempts by federal officials to retrieve them.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has denied any wrongdoing in the case and has said the documents he retained were personal.\n\nIt is unknown whether the case will begin before the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nIf elected, Trump has a number of options to kill the trial, including pardoning himself or appointing a favorable attorney general to drop the charges.\n\nNewsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney and from Smith and Cannon's offices on Thursday.\n\nPeter Shane, a law professor at New York University, told Newsweek that anyone \"observing the snail's pace at which Judge Cannon has been handling the documents case\" will not be surprised by her decision to suspend proceedings.\n\nCannon and Smith have sparred extensively about Cannon's proposed jury instructions, which would allow the jury to conclude that Trump had the right to retain presidential records as personal items.\n\nSmith has strongly objected to the proposed instructions and warned Cannon that he would appeal if she didn't change the wording.\n\nIn a ruling on April 4, Cannon called Smith's response \"unprecedented and unjust.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

Reid responded by putting on her tinfoil hat and declaring, with no evidence whatsoever, that Trump has implicitly bribed her with a future Supreme Court appointment.\n\nReid asked legal analyst Joyce Vance, \"If you're Jack Smith, do you try to somehow appeal it to the 11th Circuit and get her booted?\"\n\nVance gave a long, rambling answer that ultimately suggested such a move would, from her perspective, unfortunately not go anywhere, \"You know, the best hook that Jack Smith has for an appeal would be if Judge Cannon were to make rulings that he didn't like when it comes to whether Donald Trump can use classified information at trial. He's got a right to appeal those. Of course, we're in that pre-trial phase where the government needs a special hook to take an interlocutory appeal.

She wants to be on the Supreme Court. She thinks she can get on if Donald Trump wins. She's going to kill this case.

She's done him favors.\"\n\nRobinson tried to start again, \"Look, I know, I shouldn't put anything beyond the realm of possibility.\"\n\nInterrupting again to take a cheap shot at another woman Trump appointed, Reid declared that \"she has about as much experience as Amy Coney Barrett.\"\n\nRobinson then lamented, \"Well, yeah, but Amy Coney Barrett's a lot smarter than Aileen Cannon. I mean, look, this is an illustration of when a case goes before a federal judge, federal judges have enormous power.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nTrump has been charged with 37 counts, including 31 alleged violations of the Espionage Act for \"willful retention of national defense information,\" related to his handling of classified documents taken to his Mar-a-Lago club after leaving office.\n\nLegal experts and political strategists who spoke with Business Insider said the move wasn't a surprise since she has repeatedly sided with Trump on issues that have come up during the case's proceedings, throwing a wrench in special counsel Jack Smith's case.\n\n\"With Judge Canon reversing her own decision today, there is a high likelihood the case will get pushed out past the election,\" litigation and appeals attorney Katie Charleston, whose background in jury trials includes extensive experience reviewing government contracts and procedures, told BI.\n\nIf that's the case, and Trump is elected President again in November's presidential election, it's possible he could get rid of each of the cases brought by the Justice Department -- meaning he could dodge this trial entirely.\n\nIt's just the latest legal win for Trump in the classified documents case handed to him by Cannon. Previously, she ruled that a special master should review the classified documents seized by the FBI from Mar-A-Lago, though the decision was ultimately reversed in a blistering opinion by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCannon has also previously denied the special counsel's request to hide the names of potential witnesses in the case, though legal experts earlier this year told BI that decision would also probably be overturned on appeal. Last month, Cannon agreed to the prosecutor's request to redact witness names, per the Associated Press, though she refused to prevent witness statements from being disclosed in pretrial motions.\n\nCNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid pointed out that Cannon's critics have questioned whether her favorable rulings to Trump are due to bias, inexperience, or \"analysis paralysis.\"\n\n\"Judge Cannon has ruled in Trump's favor at almost every possible turn, so I'm not surprised that she delayed the trial indefinitely,\" Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told BI following the latest trial delay. \"She is inexperienced and seems in over her head. She's made a number of bizarre rulings that aren't supported by logic or the law, and she has already been overturned by the 11th Circuit multiple times.\"\n\nRahmani added that the delay is a significant benefit to the former president, \"especially in the middle of another trial and the presidential campaign,\" making this ruling \"yet another win for Trump in South Florida.\"\n\nTy Cobb, a former Trump White House attorney, told CNN on Tuesday that Cannon's latest decision was \"a combination of bias and incompetence.\"\n\n\"I think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\" he said.\n\nOn the political front, Cannon's decision galvanizes Trump's allies, according to Charlie Kolean, the chief strategist at RED PAC, which supports Republican candidates, including Trump. Kolean told BI that to his supporters, the decision \"proves Trump's point\" that the prosecution is \"a political witch hunt,\" indicating that Trump's supporters generally see the ruling as evidence that the law is on Trump's side.\n\nWhile many legal experts have suggested that Cannon has offered Trump favorable treatment throughout the proceedings, the confidential information at hand in the case does require careful consideration, which means such delays are to be expected, according to attorney and legal analyst Tre Lovell.\n\nBut regardless of her intention, it's still a win for Trump, whose legal strategy in his four criminal cases is \"delay, delay, delay,\" according to Doron Kalir, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.\n\nIt's just the latest example of one of Trump's trials getting delayed. The January 6 trial is on hold while the Supreme Court decides on presidential immunity, and the Georgia case was delayed due to allegations of a romantic relationship between DA Fani Willis and lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nIn light of Cannon's latest delay, Kalir said it was not surprising given her prior actions on the case.\n\nHe also noted that Trump's lawyers have succeeded in delaying three of the four cases against him -- the exception being the hush-money case which is currently at trial in New York -- calling it \"quite an impressive record!\"", "source": {"uri":

Last summer, even a Senate Republican was willing to concede the case looked like a \"slam dunk\" for prosecutors.\n\nWith this in mind, the former president and his defense attorneys, desperate to avoid a conviction, have pushed one priority above all others: Team Trump, from the outset, has tried to delay the proceedings to prevent a trial from taking place before Election Day 2024.\n\nIn order to pull that off, the Republican and his lawyers would need an accommodating and sympathetic judge, who would be willing to sacrifice her reputation, and who would needlessly drag out the process in order to make a pre-election trial nearly impossible. It's against this backdrop that The New York Times reported:\n\nThe federal judge overseeing former President Donald J. Trump's classified documents case formally scrapped her own May 20 start date for the trial on Tuesday but declined to set a new one, saying there was much more work to be done before a jury could hear the charges. The decision by Judge Aileen M. Cannon to delay the start of the trial was more or less a foregone conclusion given the number of legal issues that remain unresolved less than two weeks from the date she had originally set.\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/docs-case-controversial-judge-gives-trump-delays-needs-rcna151202", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cohn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cohn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1144, "textEnd": 1150}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

But she agreed to postpone the trial slightly beyond the January 2024 date proposed by special counsel Jack Smith's prosecution team.\n\n\"The public has a right to a prompt and efficient resolution of this matter,\" Chutkan said.\n\nIf the current date holds, it would represent a setback to Trump's efforts to push the case back until well after the 2024 presidential election, a contest in which he's the early front-runner for the Republican nomination.\n\nThe March 2024 date would also ensure a blockbuster trial in the nation's capital in the heat of the GOP presidential nominating calendar, forcing Trump to juggle campaign and courtroom appearances and coming the day before Super Tuesday -- a crucial voting day when more than a dozen states will hold primaries and when the largest number of delegates are up for grabs.\n\n\"I want to note here that setting a trial date does not depend and should not depend on the defendant's personal or professional obligations,\" Chutkan said.\n\nChutkan has so far appeared cool to Trump's efforts to delay the case but also concerned by social media comments he's made outside court. This month, she warned Trump's legal team that there were limits on what he can say publicly about evidence in the investigation. She reiterated her intention Monday for Trump to be \"treated with no more or less deference than any defendant would be treated.\"\n\nThe Washington case is one of four prosecutions Trump is facing. A March 4 trial would take place just weeks before a scheduled New York trial in a case charging him in connection with a hush money payment to a porn actress. Meanwhile in Atlanta on Monday, where Trump and 18 others were charged with trying to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows argued to try to get the charges against him transferred from state court to federal court.\n\nThe setting of the trial date came despite strong objections from Trump lawyer John Lauro. He said defense lawyers had received an enormous trove of records from Smith's team -- a prosecutor put the total at more than 12 million pages and files -- and said the case concerned novel legal issues that would require significant time to sort out.\n\n\"This is one of the most unique cases from a legal perspective ever brought in the history of the United States. Ever,\" Lauro said, calling it an \"enormous, overwhelming task\" to review such a \"gargantuan\" amount of evidence.\n\nProsecutor Molly Gaston countered that the public had an \"exceedingly\" strong interest in moving the case forward to trial and said that the basic allegations in the indictment have long been known to the defense. Trump, she noted, is accused of \"attempting to overturn an election and disenfranchise millions.\"\n\n\"There is an incredibly strong public interest in a jury's full consideration of those claims in open court,\" Gaston said.\n\nTrump, a Republican, was charged this month in a four-count indictment with scheming to undo his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nSmith's team has brought a separate federal case accusing him of illegally retaining classified documents at his Palm Beach, Florida, property, Mar-a-Lago, and refusing to give them back. That case is currently set for trial next May 20.\n\nTrump also faces the state cases in New York and Georgia. A spokesperson for New York's state court system, Lucian Chalfen, said Chutkan recently spoke with the judge in Trump's Manhattan criminal case, Juan Manuel Merchan, about their respective trials ahead. Chalfen said no decision has been made regarding postponing or rescheduling the Manhattan trial, which is to begin March 25, 2024.\n\nTrump surrendered Thursday in the Georgia case, posing with a scowl for the first mug shot in American history of a former U.S. president. He has claimed the investigations of him are politically motivated attempts to damage his chances of winning back the White House.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Michael R.

Cannon to avoid picking a date yet for former President Donald J. Trump's classified documents trial is the latest indication of how her handling of the case has played into Mr. Trump's own strategy of delaying the proceeding.\n\nIt is not impossible that the trial could still take place before Election Day, but the path is exceedingly narrow. And the question of when -- or even whether -- the charges against Mr. Trump will go before a jury will now largely hinge on how Judge Cannon handles an array of pretrial matters in the next few months, issues that many legal experts have said she could dispense with much more quickly.\n\nJudge Cannon, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his final days in office, has been on the bench for only four years. She has limited experience overseeing trials of any kind -- let alone one involving explosive allegations that a former president and current candidate illegally took highly classified state secrets from the White House after he left office and then obstructed the government's repeated efforts to retrieve them.\n\nFor months now, she has stood in the glare of the spotlight with each of her most minute decisions scrutinized by an often critical gallery of legal scholars and reporters.\n\nNancy Gertner, a former federal judge who was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, said that rookie jurists handling prominent matters deserve some measure of leeway. But she added that Judge Cannon had put herself outside the normal boundaries with her languid pace and her willingness to grant a sober audience to several of Mr. Trump's \"meshuggeneh motions.\"\n\n\"For a new judge in a big case, she could just be being careful, but the length of time all of this has taken and things she is allowing seems way beyond that,\" Judge Gertner said. \"She is treating everything the defense has done as if they all raise substantial and important issues, and that's just not true.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Gertner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Gertner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-documents-tqvj/08dc-trump-documents-tqvj-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Reid responded by putting on her tinfoil hat and declaring, with no evidence whatsoever, that Trump has implicitly bribed her with a future Supreme Court appointment.\n\nReid asked legal analyst Joyce Vance, \"If you're Jack Smith, do you try to somehow appeal it to the 11th Circuit and get her booted?\"\n\nVance gave a long, rambling answer that ultimately suggested such a move would, from her perspective, unfortunately not go anywhere, \"You know, the best hook that Jack Smith has for an appeal would be if Judge Cannon were to make rulings that he didn't like when it comes to whether Donald Trump can use classified information at trial. He's got a right to appeal those. Of course, we're in that pre-trial phase where the government needs a special hook to take an interlocutory appeal. Most sorts of issues have to wait until afterwards. So, I think what Jack Smith has been waiting for has been these rulings on the classified information.\"\n\nCracking herself up, Reid interrupted, \"She's never going to rule.\"\n\nVance continued, \"And that is one of the issues -- right. She suspended that this week. Those responses were due this week. Out of the blue, she gave Trump a continuance and so, for Jack Smith, I suspect he's now regretting the fact that he did not try to recuse her early on when he could have.\"\n\nWith absolutely zero evidence, Reid echoed an idea she floated on April 10 by following up with Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, \"As the great Lawrence O'Donnell says, Eugene, the bribe is implied. She wants to be on the Supreme Court. She thinks she can get on if Donald Trump wins. She's going to kill this case. Catch and kill as one might say.\"\n\nAlso cracking himself up, Robinson began, \"I know, but Aileen Cannon on the Supreme Court, come on. I mean, you know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know -- \"\n\nReid insisted, \"It's Trump. She's done him favors.\"\n\nRobinson tried to start again, \"Look, I know, I shouldn't put anything beyond the realm of possibility.\"\n\nInterrupting again to take a cheap shot at another woman Trump appointed, Reid declared that \"she has about as much experience as Amy Coney Barrett.\"\n\nRobinson then lamented, \"Well, yeah, but Amy Coney Barrett's a lot smarter than Aileen Cannon. I mean, look, this is an illustration of when a case goes before a federal judge, federal judges have enormous power.

Last summer, even a Senate Republican was willing to concede the case looked like a \"slam dunk\" for prosecutors.\n\nWith this in mind, the former president and his defense attorneys, desperate to avoid a conviction, have pushed one priority above all others: Team Trump, from the outset, has tried to delay the proceedings to prevent a trial from taking place before Election Day 2024.\n\nIn order to pull that off, the Republican and his lawyers would need an accommodating and sympathetic judge, who would be willing to sacrifice her reputation, and who would needlessly drag out the process in order to make a pre-election trial nearly impossible. It's against this backdrop that The New York Times reported:\n\nThe Times' report added that while Cannon's \"stated reason for putting off the trial indefinitely was that a large number of legal issues remain up in the air, she never mentioned that she herself helped allow the logjam of motions to pile up.\"\n\nThese developments came one day after Cannon reversed one of her earlier decisions and postponed a key court-filing deadline. It led the Times to note that Cannon -- who was tapped by the federal bench by Trump and confirmed by Senate Republicans after Trump lost his re-election bid -- has repeatedly \"treated seriously arguments that many, if not most, federal judges would have rejected out of hand. Often, her acceptance of Mr. Trump's unorthodox claims have resulted in significant delays in bringing the charges in the classified documents case in front of a jury.\"\n\nIn the recent past, the classified documents case was expected to be the first to go to trial. Thanks to Cannon, no one can say with confidence when -- or by some measures, if -- the case will proceed.\n\nBefore reaching this point, the conservative jurist has thrown so many roadblocks at prosecutors that outside attorneys, legal experts, and even former judges have struggled to understand and/or defend Cannon's tactics.\n\nNancy Gertner, a former federal judge, told The Washington Post in March, in reference to Cannon, \"What she has asked the parties to do is very, very troubling.

But no, this is a combination of bias and incompetence.... The things that she has done here are really inexplicable, and it's tragic....

This guy was finally going to drop the hammer on Trump and take him out of American politics forever.\n\nMueller failed to deliver on the high hopes of the left. And it's looking more and more as if Smith will also fall short of their big prize of taking Trump down.\n\nThings started to go South for Smith in a hurry when the Judge in the Mar-A-Lago documents case started ordering the removal of redactions on documents produced by the prosecution.\n\nCaught in his lie, he was forced to admit he had misrepresented the true nature of evidence against Trump to the court. It was not as 'intact' as he had first claimed.: UH-OH: Did Trump Document Prosecutor Admit To Evidence Tampering?\n\nThat triggered a series of consequences. Here's a critical one the left is losing their collective minds over... they won't get a verdict on the Mar-A-Lago documents case before the election.\n\nDonald Trump's trial in Florida on charges of illegally keeping classified documents after leaving office has been indefinitely postponed, a judge decided on Tuesday, greatly reducing the odds he will face a jury in either of the two federal criminal cases against him before the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\n[...] U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, said on Tuesday the trial would no longer begin May 20 but did not set a new date. Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22. -- Reuters\n\nHe won't get to parade Trump's scalp as the ultimate October Surprise. But that's just the beginning of sorrows for Smith.\n\nThe predator has now become the prey. After Jack Smith seems to have been caught committing some of the very same legal infractions in mishandling classified documents that he is attempting to convict the former President of committing, a House Oversight investigation is now being opened up against Jack Smith.\n\nSure, we understand the likelihood of Smith facing any negative consequences under a Biden presidency is slim and none. But an investigation CAN bring to the public eye the kind of information that would vindicate Trump's claims that this whole legal case has been a politcal seek-and-destroy mission orchestrated by no less than the White House itself.\n\nPublic confirmation of what we all believe to be true on that front is something team Biden would rather not see happen.\n\nThese dirty tricks have opened Smith up to scrutiny from the judge overseeing the Florida documents case.\n\nAmong the questions Judge Cannon has been considering is the question of whether Smith himself has the required standing to have initiated any of these cases in the first place. She's also taking an interest in the degree of involvement of the Biden White House.\n\nSmith's status is an interesting one. He was never confirmed by the senate. An amicus brief has gone in support of one of Trump's many cases making exactly that point about Jack Smith. If he's not confirmed by the Senate, he does not have the requisite standing to execute any of the powers that have brought us to this point in the first place... including the calling of a Grand Jury.\n\nFor all Smith's effort to take down Trump, and for all the sketchy leverage he has brought to bear against various defendants and witnesses (including inquiries about whether Trump's co-defendant valet had a girlfriend he could pressure), this entire case could crumble to dust because he's a nobody exercising power that was never his to use in the first place.\n\nBut with Fani under the microscope for malfeasance, Smith admitting to evidence tampering, top-ranked Democrat operatives jumping from the DOJ to work in the prosecution, and even Stormy Daniels now being called out by Avenatti for exactly the kind of sketchy bank records her own testimony is supposedly trying to prove...\n\nIt's starting to look like Biden's DOJ is the one that's REALLY on trial here.\n\nAnd that would be some serious BAD news for the Biden campaign... especially if the verdict turns against them.\n\nGive a middle finger to unaccountable global censors and big tech fascists.

While the former president has spent the last few weeks in and out of New York's Manhattan criminal courthouse, forced to listen to prospective jurors' criticism and witnesses' sensational accounts of alleged misdeeds, outside New York, Trump is having a little more luck.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Georgia Court of Appeals decided it will hear an appeal of a ruling allowing District Attorney Fani Willis to remain at the helm of Fulton County's sprawling election interference case. Trump's lawyers argue the case should be dismissed on grounds of Willis' alleged \"misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe appeal hearing is expected to further postpone the already delayed trial, notching a small, but important win for Trump's team as they seek to stall his many legal troubles until after the November presidential election.\n\n\"There's no way this case gets to trial this year,\" Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nIn fact, it's increasingly likely New York's hush-money case, in which adult film actor Stormy Daniels testified this week, is the only one of the four criminal cases against Trump that will go to trial before Nov. 5. On Tuesday, Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, delayed Jack Smith's classified documents case in Florida indefinitely. Meanwhile, the Jan. 6 election trial is on ice while the Supreme Court mulls Trump's presidential immunity argument.\n\nSources: ABC News, The Atlantic, Reuters\n\nPolls suggest a fifth of Trump supporters would reconsider or withdraw their support if he were convicted of a crime -- that's a large enough portion of his base to potentially tip the balance in what is expected to be a coin-toss election. But that's not the only reason Trump wants these trials to drag on for as long as possible. If the trials are delayed before he is re-elected, presuming he wins, he would be in an unprecedented position to shut the prosecution against him down, at least on the federal level. \"That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election,\" George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason told Reuters.\n\nSources: Politico, The Hill\n\nTrump has been held in contempt ten times for violating a gag order on his New York trial, but the $10,000 fine may be the least of his concerns, former federal prosecutor Ankush Khardori wrote for Politico. Trump's behavior is \"clearly angering both prosecutors and the judge,\" who has wide latitude in determining a sentence for Trump if found guilty, \"materially increasing the odds that he will be sent to prison if he is convicted at the end of the trial.\"\n\nBut jailing Trump for violating his gag order could have an undesired side effect for Democrats. Jail time could \"give him yet more ammunition for rallying his base\" and a much-needed fundraising boost, Washington Examiner editor W. James Antle III wrote.\n\nSources: The Washington Post, The Telegraph\n\nSome legal experts have argued that the novel tactics prosecutors in Trump's hush-money case have used to stack misdemeanor and felony charges together is a \"dubious legal move\" that could make securing a conviction more difficult. To elevate a misdemeanor -- doctoring financial records -- to a felony, they need to prove that it was done to conceal another crime -- conspiracy to influence the 2016 election. \"Prosecutors cannot simply make up new crimes by jerry-rigging a concoction of existing crimes,\" Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz wrote for The Telegraph. Not everyone agreed; New York Law School professor Anna Cominsky countered that an extraordinary case calls for unusual legal strategies. \"This is that one in a million case, but that doesn't mean that it's selective prosecution,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump",

He has covered national, state and local politics, breaking news, criminal investigations and trials, sports and a variety of community issues, with a special emphasis on racial justice, right-wing extremism and gun safety.\n\nMSNBC's Joe Scarborough walloped Judge Aileen Cannon's decision to indefinitely postpone Donald Trump's trial for mishandling classified documents.\n\nThe federal judge canceled a trial date for later this month and set a new schedule for working out legal issues related to how classified evidence will be presented to a jury, and the \"Morning Joe\" host blasted what he said were her shameless efforts to tip the scales of justice in favor of the former president who appointed her.\n\n\"I have faith in the judicial system that the end of the day, everything does balance out, so I'm not here, like, you know, like, you know, trashing the American judicial system,\" Scarborough said. \"Sometimes stuff just happens, and here we have just a great irony where we are living through a case that a lot of people don't think should have ever been brought and we are never going to hear a case that is actually central to Donald Trump's crimes.\"\n\nScarborough and the other panelists agreed the trial would almost certainly not happen before the November election, and Trump would almost certainly bury the case if he is re-elected.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Outrageous': Army reservist with KKK ties still in the military\n\n\"I think that ship has long since sailed,\" said legal analyst Lisa Rubin. \"Yesterday was no surprise, and I can't underscore how little of a surprise it was. It was more surprising that Stormy Daniels got on the stand and said she had sex with Donald Trump than Cannon postponed the trial day. She has a number of motions that haven't even been scheduled yet under the Classified Procedures Act, she has a number of pending motions that have been fully briefed for months now on which she has made no decision. I wouldn't venture a guess at when this case would be ready for trial, [and] I believe that is by design. I continue to be disappointed by Judge Cannon and her execution of the role of federal jurist here.\"\n\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals already vacated Cannon's orders in the earliest days of this case, finding that she had no jurisdiction to hear Trump's complaint about the search of his Mar-a-Lago resort that turned up the classified documents that had been sought by the National Archives.\n\n\"They excoriated her on appeal and just humiliating her, and I thought she would be a bit more careful and play more down the center and play more by the rules than she has, but she has not,\" Scarborough said. \"You look what she is talking about regarding jury instructions, it's crazy! It's crazy! A 12-year-old that went with her mother to 'take a kid to court' day, like as a lawyer, would have come up with a better ruling than she has come up with. It's bizarre, and I am sure that if that is appealed, now that there is time the 11th Circuit will excoriate her again. She must not care what think the world thinks of her.

As president, President Trump could direct the Department of Justice to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.\n\nThe charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\nPresident Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 charges connected to allegations that he illegally retained classified documents at his home after leaving in January 2021 and obstructed officials' attempts to retrieve them. Two of his aides, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, have also been charged in the case.\n\nHe also faces charges in New York, where a trial is currently ongoing in which he is accused of falsifying business records during the 2016 election. Election interference charges were also filed in Fulton County, Georgia, and Washington.\n\nHe's pleaded not guilty to those charges, too, arguing they're part of an orchestrated plot to imperil his 2024 reelection chances.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renato_Mariotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renato Mariotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judicial Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage Act of 1917"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/02/16/id5588679-Jack-Smith-Donald-Trump-LSedit-2-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1457, "textEnd": 1463}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Read it now.\n\nDonald Trump's legal troubles are taking a turn. While the former president has spent the last few weeks in and out of New York's Manhattan criminal courthouse, forced to listen to prospective jurors' criticism and witnesses' sensational accounts of alleged misdeeds, outside New York, Trump is having a little more luck.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Georgia Court of Appeals decided it will hear an appeal of a ruling allowing District Attorney Fani Willis to remain at the helm of Fulton County's sprawling election interference case. Trump's lawyers argue the case should be dismissed on grounds of Willis' alleged \"misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe appeal hearing is expected to further postpone the already delayed trial, notching a small, but important win for Trump's team as they seek to stall his many legal troubles until after the November presidential election.\n\n\"There's no way this case gets to trial this year,\" Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nIn fact, it's increasingly likely New York's hush-money case, in which adult film actor Stormy Daniels testified this week, is the only one of the four criminal cases against Trump that will go to trial before Nov. 5. On Tuesday, Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, delayed Jack Smith's classified documents case in Florida indefinitely.

But I actually don't think that [special counsel] Jack [Smith] made a mistake here. I think he played it straight. I've been on high-profile cases where the issue is what venue should you pick, and the overarching issue is to play it straight. Where are the facts that sort of form the crime? Where did they occur? You know, that principle is in the Constitution -- that you should be tried where the crime occurred.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And here, only in the district where Judge Cannon is one of three judges, is a locust for all of the crimes charged. In other words, some of the crimes might have been charged elsewhere, but not all of them, and there's no question that the gravamen -- all of the facts -- are ones that could all be charged in that district. And so there was going to be a one out of three chance under the wheel, as it gets spun randomly, that she got the case.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Scratch off the Georgia trial': Experts say second Trump case likely delayed past election\n\nThe ex-FBI lawyer emphasized, \"And the real issue here, I think, is not really Jack Smith. It is Judge Cannon. It is just truly a disgrace that she is not doing her job. You pointed out, Nicolle, that she couldn't even handle the search warrant. She was reversed, not once, but twice over that. She had to get another federal judge to be the special master, when she could have just rolled up her sleeves and done the work. And now her decision says, 'Well, there are a lot of pending motions, that's why I need to take more time.'

This guy was finally going to drop the hammer on Trump and take him out of American politics forever.\n\nMueller failed to deliver on the high hopes of the left. And it's looking more and more as if Smith will also fall short of their big prize of taking Trump down.\n\nThings started to go South for Smith in a hurry when the Judge in the Mar-A-Lago documents case started ordering the removal of redactions on documents produced by the prosecution.\n\nCaught in his lie, he was forced to admit he had misrepresented the true nature of evidence against Trump to the court. It was not as 'intact' as he had first claimed.: UH-OH: Did Trump Document Prosecutor Admit To Evidence Tampering?\n\nThat triggered a series of consequences. Here's a critical one the left is losing their collective minds over... they won't get a verdict on the Mar-A-Lago documents case before the election.\n\nDonald Trump's trial in Florida on charges of illegally keeping classified documents after leaving office has been indefinitely postponed, a judge decided on Tuesday, greatly reducing the odds he will face a jury in either of the two federal criminal cases against him before the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\n[...]\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, said on Tuesday the trial would no longer begin May 20 but did not set a new date. Cannon scheduled pre-trial hearings to run through July 22. -- Reuters\n\nHe won't get to parade Trump's scalp as the ultimate October Surprise. But that's just the beginning of sorrows for Smith.\n\nThe predator has now become the prey. After Jack Smith seems to have been caught committing some of the very same legal infractions in mishandling classified documents that he is attempting to convict the former President of committing, a House Oversight investigation is now being opened up against Jack Smith.\n\nSure, we understand the likelihood of Smith facing any negative consequences under a Biden presidency is slim and none. But an investigation CAN bring to the public eye the kind of information that would vindicate Trump's claims that this whole legal case has been a politcal seek-and-destroy mission orchestrated by no less than the White House itself.\n\nPublic confirmation of what we all believe to be true on that front is something team Biden would rather not see happen.\n\nThese dirty tricks have opened Smith up to scrutiny from the judge overseeing the Florida documents case.\n\nAmong the questions Judge Cannon has been considering is the question of whether Smith himself has the required standing to have initiated any of these cases in the first place. She's also taking an interest in the degree of involvement of the Biden White House.\n\nSmith's status is an interesting one. He was never confirmed by the senate. An amicus brief has gone in support of one of Trump's many cases making exactly that point about Jack Smith. If he's not confirmed by the Senate, he does not have the requisite standing to execute any of the powers that have brought us to this point in the first place... including the calling of a Grand Jury.\n\nFor all Smith's effort to take down Trump, and for all the sketchy leverage he has brought to bear against various defendants and witnesses (including inquiries about whether Trump's co-defendant valet had a girlfriend he could pressure), this entire case could crumble to dust because he's a nobody exercising power that was never his to use in the first place.\n\nBut with Fani under the microscope for malfeasance, Smith admitting to evidence tampering, top-ranked Democrat operatives jumping from the DOJ to work in the prosecution, and even Story Daniels now being called out by Avenatti for exactly the kind of sketchy bank records her own testimony is supposedly trying to prove...\n\nIt's starting to look like Biden's DOJ is the one that's REALLY on trial here.\n\nAnd that would be some serious BAD news for the Biden campaign... especially if the verdict turns against them.\n\nI Talk Back to the Devil is an action manual that sports thirty pure fire proclamations against the powers of darkness in three different categories covering, the wealth, the walk and the warfare of the Christian against Satan and his defeated ilk.\n\nThis NEW book will put a serrated edge on the Christian's prayer life in these troubled times.

Trump's criminal trial(s) are truly historic. He is the first former president to be put on trial for committing a felony. The hush-money trial has now taken on even more importance. Judge Aileen Cannon has indefinitely postponed Donald Trump's federal trial in Florida for stealing classified documents. On Wednesday, Trump's trial in Georgia for election interference was also indefinitely delayed pending an appeals court decision. Trump's criminal trial for the coup attempt and plot to end democracy on Jan. 6 is also likely to be delayed as well. This means the New York hush-money trial may be the only opportunity before the 2024 election to hold Trump accountable for his crimes.\n\nThe storytelling and dramatic elements of Trump's hush-money trial also explain why it has attracted obsessive attention from the news media. It is a story about a man who became president and paid money to his mistress, who at the time was an adult film star, to hide potentially incriminating evidence from the American people before an election. Stormy Daniels is also a compelling personality on her own terms because of how she overcame poverty, rose to fame, and the force of her personality and intelligence.\n\nThe hush-money trial also has other traits that make it so compelling for the mainstream news media: It is fundamentally a story about the law, money, crime, a cover-up, a scandal, and power. In all, this is a far more familiar and comforting story for the American mainstream news media to cover than the larger democracy crisis and the rise of neofascism.\n\nAnd of course, sitting at the center of the spectacle is Donald Trump, who, mostly for horrible reasons, is one of the most discussed and fascinating public figures in recent American history.\n\nDuring the hush-money trial he has mostly lived up to that role, acting the part of a mob boss and wannabe dictator and strongman who is sleeping in court, threatening the judges and witnesses, using profanity, generally being contemptuous and disrespectful, and acting like he wants to provoke Judge Merchan into finding him in contempt and putting him in jail.\n\nBut the mainstream news media's obsession with the hush-money trial is committing the error of mostly ignoring Donald Trump's attempts to convince the United States Supreme Court that he is basically a king and above the law because of \"presidential immunity.\" The court's right-wing justices - three of whom were appointed by Donald Trump - appear likely to grant, in part or in whole, Trump's demand for nearly unlimited power and by doing so to fundamentally betray the Constitution and American democracy.\n\nYes, the hush-money trial is vitally important. But it is Trump's Supreme Court case that is of paramount importance for the future of American democracy.\n\nUsing the logic of television, Donald Trump's hush-money trial is the main storyline. The Supreme Court case has been made into the B plot when it actually merits its own series - or perhaps even a big-budget film. When considered together, they are a type of split-screen event, where two things are happening simultaneously, but the public's attention is divided, as Politico observes:\n\nIt will be a historic and surreal split screen: a former president, current presidential candidate and four-time criminal defendant whose lawyers will be fighting two very different sets of felony charges in two courthouses simultaneously. It's a reminder of Trump's ability -- even while sitting in his New York trial about hush money payments to a porn star -- to command the attention of every branch of the government he once again seeks to lead.\n\nWhat has been glossed over, if not subsumed by TTT, are the horrible implications of what it would mean if Donald Trump is given the powers of dictator by a Supreme Court that has determined the president is basically above the law.\n\nAt the New York Times, Jamelle Bouie summarized this dangerous absurdity:\n\nDonald Trump's claim that he has absolute immunity for criminal acts taken in office as president is an insult to reason, an assault on common sense and a perversion of the fundamental maxim of American democracy: that no man is above the law.\n\nMore astonishing than the former president's claim to immunity, however, is the fact that the Supreme Court took the case in the first place. It's not just that there's an obvious response -- no, the president is not immune to criminal prosecution for illegal actions committed with the imprimatur of executive power, whether private or \"official\" (a distinction that does not exist in the Constitution) -- but that the court has delayed, perhaps indefinitely, the former president's reckoning with the criminal legal system of the United States....\n\nTrump has asked the Supreme Court if he is, in effect, a king. And at least four members of the court, among them the so-called originalists, have said, in essence, that they'll have to think about it.\n\nThe details and specifics of Donald Trump's claims to presidential immunity need to be emphasized if one is to fully see and comprehend their true horror.\n\nTrump's attorneys are trying to convince the United States Supreme Court that a president can order his political rivals (or anyone else for that matter) killed by the military, for any reason, and it would be \"legal.\" Likewise, per this argument, a president can engage in wantonly corrupt behavior such as accepting bribes and that too would be \"legal.\" In theory, the courts and Congress and other parts of the government would provide checks and balances on presidential authority. In practice such a conclusion is ridiculous because what reasonable person would oppose a president who has the power to order them murdered, imprisoned, disappeared, or to suffer some other horrible fate without have any real fear of being held responsible for committing such \"crimes.\"\n\nThere is a way to describe a leader and country where such things are \"legal\": a dictatorship.\n\nWriting at the Nation, Elie Mystal shares his assessment of the American mainstream news media and its failures to properly cover the Supreme Court and Trump's claims of unlimited power:\n\nIn the few days since the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Trump v. United States -- the case that will determine whether Donald Trump has lifetime immunity from crimes he committed while in office -- the national media has failed. The reports about what happened during the hearing, and how the Republican justices are likely to rule, range from credulous simplicity to outright gaslighting. The court will almost certainly take the extreme, unprecedented, and previously unfathomable position that Trump cannot be held criminally accountable for all of his actions -- and the reason it is likely to do so is that the court knows the media will carry its water and normalize its ruling to a public that lacks the time and acumen to fully appreciate what it's doing.\n\nI'm not talking about Fox News or Newsmax, whose coverage I have not read or watched but assume it's ranged from cultish to clownish, as it always does. I'm talking about the mainstream press, the so-called \"liberal\" press, which is taking its cue from the Supreme Court and trying to normalize the proposition that presidents should be immune from at least some crimes.\n\nThe idea of presidential criminal immunity is wholly unprecedented in the American experience. Other than Donald Trump, only Richard Nixon has claimed it, and Nixon's argument was roundly rejected, not just by the courts but also by the media-industrial complex. This time, however, Trump's claim -- and the court's bankrupt willingness to back it -- is finding purchase in the national media.\n\nMystal concludes:\n\nThe president is not above the law, which means he cannot be immune from accountability for the rest of his life. The president should be, must be, and always has been subject to prosecution for crimes. Anybody telling you anything else is trying to keep you docile and compliant while they pretend that the Supreme Court has access to mystical knowledge we little people cannot comprehend.\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to crown Donald Trump as king of America. That is the headline. That is the thesis that should be nailed to a church door.\n\nThe American news media, and especially the elite agenda-setting news media such as the New York Times and Washington Post, have a responsibility to adequately cover both the hush-money trial and Donald Trump's plans and aspirations to be a dictator. Moreover, the elite agenda-setting news media possess the necessary resources to practice that type of essential pro-democracy journalism if they so choose.\n\nUnfortunately, as an institution, the American news media, and its most elite outlets, have decided not to do it.\n\nTo that point, in a much-discussed new interview, New York Times executive editor Joe Kahn directly explains that he believes it is not the responsibility of the news media in a democracy to stop an aspiring dictator:\n\nIt's also true that Trump could win this election in a popular vote. Given that Trump's not in office, it will probably be fair. And there's a very good chance, based on our polling and other independent polling, that he will win that election in a popular vote. So there are people out there in the world who may decide, based on their democratic rights, to elect Donald Trump as president. It is not the job of the news media to prevent that from happening. It's the job of Biden and the people around Biden to prevent that from happening.\n\nUltimately, the spectacle of Donald Trump's hush-money trial is too alluring and enthralling for the American news media.\n\nIt may not have been part of their strategic plan, but Donald Trump and the MAGA movement and the other right-wing and neofascist enemies of democracy are benefitting from the news media's hyperfocus on the New York hush-money trial. How? Because that obsession diverts the American people's attention away from how the Supreme Court is preparing to make Donald Trump and his successors de facto kings and dictators.", "source": {"uri":

According to a prior indictment, the classified materials Trump stored in boxes at his home contained information on the defense and weapons capabilities of the US and other nations, details about US nuclear initiatives, vulnerabilities of the US and its allies to military strikes, and contingency plans for retaliatory actions against foreign aggressions. Trump has maintained that the legal actions against him are politically motivated to prevent his candidacy against President Joe Biden in the upcoming November 2024 elections. The former president appeared at his initial court hearing concerning these charges in Miami on June 13. On the same day, during a gathering at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, Trump declared the indictment a form of \"political persecution\" and promised to \"completely dismantle the deep state\" if he were to win the election in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deep state in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political repression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedminster,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bedminster, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1118326024.jpg?11183258491715123458", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1345, "textEnd": 1352}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 412, "textEnd": 418}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter\n\nOnly an extraordinary cocktail of strategic delay, judicial scale-thumbing and good old fashioned bungling could leave just one of four Donald Trump felony indictment cases likely to conclude (and quite possibly even to start) before Election Day.\n\nThat future, long looming, became even more concrete this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to hear Trump's appeal of the decision not to boot Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case following her romantic relationship with a prosecutor she'd hired. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, in a scathing March ruling in which he upbraided Willis for her decision making and conduct on the stand, had allowed her to stay on the case if she removed Nathan Wade, the prosecutor she dated.\n\nMuch like the Jan. 6 case -- we're awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the extent of Trump's presidential immunity -- litigation over this one spoke of the case must play out before the meaty merits can move forward. In short: delay.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Jack Smith's valiant effort to foresee and defang the Supreme Court's pro-Trump feet-dragging in the Jan. 6 case was swatted down, making murky whether the immunity question alone -- much less whether Trump incited an insurrection -- will be cleared up before Trump potentially takes over the Justice Department.\n\nPut an x through Jan. 6 and the Georgia election trials. That leaves perhaps the most straightforward, slam-dunk case: Trump's indictment for hoarding classified documents in Mar-a-Lago after his presidential term and then lying about it. Luckily for democracy, the case is in the formidable, neutral, just-calling-balls-and-strikes hands of Judge Aileen Cannon (sigh).\n\nCannon (and Trump) won the weighted dice-roll to get the case in the first place thanks, in part, to the many vacancies at the time in the Southern District of Florida. Why the vacancies? Because for some godforsaken reason, we are still playing by the \"blue slip\" rules, where the President's judicial nominees are traditionally blocked unless they get a thumbs up from both home state senators. From 1956 to 2016, the Congressional Research Service found only three judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate despite lacking the two endorsements.\n\nTherefore: Cannon's constant delays of the trial, essentially an in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign, can be directly traced to President Joe Biden's reluctance to even nominate judges for that district, knowing that whoever he picks will be rejected by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rick Scott (R-FL). But I digress.\n\nCannon suspended yet another deadline Monday, in keeping with months of slow rolling and eyebrow-raising amenability to Trump's dumb arguments. She's successfully both kept the trial from proceeding and from giving Smith much substance on which he can appeal. She didn't bother setting a new trial date -- the better to get her name on the Supreme Court shortlist, should Trump be given the opportunity.\n\nNo Jan. 6, no Georgia, no stolen documents. That leaves the New York case -- where Trump allegedly disguised repayment to Michael Cohen for quashing the story about his affair with Stormy Daniels just before the election -- as the only game in town.\n\nPolling has remained unfriendly for Biden. He'd made up some ground through the early spring, but still trails Trump (or is virtually tied with him) in the states that will decide the election. But many voters -- independents in particular -- say that a Trump conviction would disqualify him in their eyes.\n\nIf that's true, a conviction could decide the election. And if it does, it'll happen in New York -- Trump's hometown, the cauldron of his celebrity and his potential downfall.\n\nNEW from Hunter Walker: How Republicans Went From The Tea Party, To 'Stop The

These revelations prompted Trump's co-defendant, Walt Nauta, to seek a trial delay, citing challenges in pinpointing specific documents within the compromised evidence.\n\nTrump seized upon the opportunity to escalate his ongoing feud with Smith, characterizing the situation as a blatant attempt to undermine his presidency. Accusing Smith of orchestrating an \"Election Interference Scam,\" Trump painted himself as the victim of a politically motivated witch hunt. (Related: DOJ accused of gross double standard in decision not to file criminal charges against Biden over mishandling of classified documents.)\n\nWhile Trump's accusations ignited a firestorm of controversy, Smith's office remained conspicuously silent, refraining from public comment amidst mounting scrutiny.\n\nFederal prosecutors attempted to downplay the significance of the evidence discrepancies, attributing them to the logistics of handling sensitive materials.\n\nIn response, Trump's legal team continued to press their accusations of systematic malfeasance within the prosecution's ranks. They argued that the integrity of the case had been irreparably compromised, casting doubt on the validity of the whole proceeding.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

The trial's start date, originally slated for May 20, hang in limbo as Cannon deliberates on the appropriate course of action in light of the latest developments.\n\nAmid the turmoil, Trump, Nauta and Mar-a-Lago maintenance worker Carlos De Oliveira faced a litany of charges related to the alleged mishandling and obstruction of classified materials. The specter of a prolonged legal battle looms large, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the futures of those involved in the high-stakes legal saga.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Trump hasn't held back in expressing his concerns over Smith's continued participation in the trial.\n\nThe former president has labeled the prosecutor a \"thug\" with a \"mental state of derangement,\" among other derogatory terms. He's even gone as far as calling Smith a \"mad dog psycho,\" an \"animal\" and a \"lunatic,\" and has accused him of orchestrating a \"treasonous\" investigation deserving of \"sanctions.\"\n\nSo, it wasn't surprising when Trump unleashed another round of insults at Smith during a closed-door donor retreat over the weekend. According to reports, Trump referred to Smith as an \"evil thug\" and \"deranged,\" even going so far as to call him a \"f------ a--hole.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has hinted at legal action against Smith. He previously suggested that Smith \"may very well turn out to be a criminal.\"\n\nUPDATE: Judge Cannon unseals MORE unredacted documents - exposes THREATS from Smith's office.\n\nCOLLUSION: Biden staffers met with top aide for Special Counsel Jack Smith at the White House before Trump indictment.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith accused of deliberately impeding Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nJack Smith's indictments of President Trump are ill-founded and unconstitutional, judicial clerk explains why.", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NaturalNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic_Wimpout", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic Wimpout", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/05/Final-Debate-2020-Donald-Trump.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547630", "eventUri": "eng-9547630", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2238, "textEnd": 2244}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

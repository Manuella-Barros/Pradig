Lukman, a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, PGF, in a statement on Saturday, said pushing the APC out of power remains the only way to address the avalanche of challenges bedevilling the country. He said defeating the APC in 2027 is possible if opposition parties and Nigerians unite, just like top politicians united and succeeded in pushing the military back to the barracks. \"Nigerians are groaning over the spate of killings, kidnappings for ransom, food crisis, hike in electricity tariff, and high cost of transportation, goods and services in the country occasioned by the removal of fuel subsidy by the APC-led government\", he added \u201cPatriotic Nigerians and democrats must resume the business of national mobilisation to produce an alternative democratic platform to APC and all the charades of registered political parties. We must summon the courage and believe in the power of possibility\" \u201cJust like we succeeded in pushing the military back to the barracks and defeating the PDP in 2015, it is possible to create a politically viable and truly popular democratically alternative platform that can put the APC in its rightful place and overcome the current extreme right-wing adventurously unplanned leadership of President Asiwaju Tinubu\" \u201cNigerians must be mobilised to rise above dishonest politicians who only manipulate their way to power and reduce citizens to the status of conquered people. Democracy will be worthless if the result is only to elect civilian overlords\u201d The former Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum said the APC has abandoned its vision and reduced it to a mere platform for winning elections.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Salihu-Lukman.jpeg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Salihu-Lukman.jpeg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Salihu-Lukman-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Salihu-Lukman-1024x796.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>The former National Vice Chairman, North-West, of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Salihu Mohammed Lukman, has urged opposition parties and other critical stakeholders across the country to mobilise Nigerians towards dislodging the APC in 2027.

ClearVue PV has developed a cutting-edge \u201csolar window\u201d that can be used as a facade for buildings to make the structures more energy-efficient and capable of generating electricity. As part of that ambitious effort, Australia-based ClearVue is hoping to parlay the green energy push \u2014 in particular the Bay Area and California \u2014 into success for its solar window products. ClearVue has developed specialized glass technologies that can keep a window fully transparent yet also able to generate electricity. The company demonstrated its technology Monday during an event to officially open its operations and headquarters in San Jose. \u201cWe picked San Jose because San Jose is leading the pack on green energy,\u201d Charles Mowrey, president of ClearVue North America, said in an interview during the event. The solar window invented by ClearVue allows light to pass through the glass. It then immediately redirects the incoming sun rays onto solar cells that can generate electricity for the building. \u201cClearVue offers some really exciting technologies,\u201d San Jose Matt Mahan said in an interview. The company has a handful of employees and expects to expand to 20 workers at the headquarters in San Jose. \u201cBuildings should be able to produce energy on-site and not drag the electricity through miles of wires to the building,\u201d said Victor Rosenberg, ClearVue founder and inventor of the solar window. In September 2023, ClearVue revealed that it was finding success in mass production using a standard manufacturing line at a factory in China. \u201cIf you decentralize the energy, you don\u2019t have to spend as much money upgrading the grid,\u201d said Martin Deil, ClearVue\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to cope with peak demand\u201d for electricity. The prospect of cost-effective mass production could be a major boost for the company\u2019s efforts worldwide and in the efforts that the San Jose headquarters will guide. \u201cBuildings should be net-zero, they should be generating their own power,\u201d Mowrey said. ClearVue also aims to scout for industrial space in the vicinity, executives said. \u201cWe want to continue to be a center for innovation,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that ClearVue has decided to locate here.\u201d", "summary": "ClearVue's windows can be used as a facade for buildings, making the structures more energy-efficient and capable of generating electricity.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/17/san-jose-solar-energy-tech-jobs-economy-property-real-estate-build/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SJM-L-SJSOLAR-x-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:14:12", "author": "George Avalos", "authors": ["George Avalos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.357}

Marjorie Taylor Greene will meet privately on Monday, sources told ABC News, amid Greene's looming threat to try to oust him.\n\nThe one-on-one meeting, slated for 3:30 p.m. ET, comes as Greene has said she will force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week.\n\nThe timing of when Greene plans to trigger the motion to vacate, however, remains unclear. The House will hold votes later Monday evening, after which Greene could act on the motion, though she's made no announcements.\n\nMORE: Marjorie Taylor Greene says she's moving ahead with effort to oust Speaker Johnson\n\nThe Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Greene said in a fiery press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on May 1 alongside her co-sponsor Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. \"He has proven that over and over again.\"\n\nGreene and Massie continued their criticisms of Johnson publicly on social media on Monday.\n\n\"This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker,\" Massie said in a statement on X. \"If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year, you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson.\"\n\nGreene has dangled the motion to vacate the speaker's chair for more than a month. Johnson's defended himself from her criticism -- namely that he's worked with Democrats to keep the government open, provide foreign aid and more -- by emphasizing that he's a lifelong Republican, but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" Johnson said last week of the ouster threat.\n\nMORE: House Democratic leaders announce they would save Johnson if threat to oust comes to floor\n\nJohnson also received a boost over the weekend from former President Donald Trump, who brought Johnson on stage at the Republican Nation Committee's spring retreat luncheon at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump praised Johnson \"for his leadership and work in the US House,\" emphasizing \"the need for party unity, collaboration, and expanding the GOP's House Majority,\" according to Trump's campaign.\n\nLast week, Greene denied she was defying Trump in pushing ahead against Johnson.\n\n\"I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump and that's why I fight every single day. And that's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats,\" she told ABC News Correspondent Elizabeth Schulze.\n\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler and Soorin Kim contributed to this report.\n\nJohnson, Greene to meet as Greene vows to force vote this week on ousting the speaker originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_peller@aol.com", "name": "Lauren Peller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gH5hLwVGMve6hAxpcYM38A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/78ac69eba2887cfae9a4111b9f4bc084", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1101, "textEnd": 1106}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The Georgia lawmaker first filed her motion to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) after he helped pass the $1.2 trillion spending bill to keep the government rolling back in March. Now she plans to force the vote sometime in the coming week, but does she have the support she needs to take Johnson down?\n\nA sticking point for her aspirations, however, is that it seems House Democrats have his back. A handful of Republicans have also made public remarks either defending the speaker or criticizing Greene - or both - making the motion to vacate seem destined to fail. But what price will Johnson, or his fellow Republicans, for that matter, pay for this help from across the aisle?\n\nIf the Democratic caucus voted against Johnson, as it did with Kevin McCarthy's ouster as speaker, it would take just a handful of rebel Republicans to pluck the gavel from the current speaker's grasp. But Democratic leaders took this option out of play.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" read a statement in late April by the three leading Democrats in the House, Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Katherine Clark (D-MA), and Pete Aguilar (D-CA). \"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\" While some Democrats might refuse to toe the party line and vote to oust Johnson for their own reasons, the majority are likely to follow their leaders in this, meaning that Johnson's position as speaker of the House is safe - at least for now.\n\nBut what of his career in the broader sense? If a sizable group of Republicans vote to vacate the chair, there will certainly be those who say Johnson's own party wanted him out, but the Democrats propped him up anyway - and the more Republicans that vote against Johnson, the worse that perception will be. And that isn't the only way this can come back to bite the speaker - or Republicans in general, for that matter - later. By standing united behind Johnson, House Democrats get to campaign on both unity and bipartisanship. They will be able to tell voters they stood united while Republicans bickered among themselves, and they'll get to say they were able to put people before politics and work across the aisle to get the work done and keep the wheels turning.\n\nIndeed, Hakeem Jeffries has already started crafting this narrative on the Sunday shows. Speaking with CBS, he said:\n\n\"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done... Those are just the facts.\n\n\"It's a difficult situation on the other side of the aisle, because many of my Republican colleagues are more interested in creating chaos, dysfunction, and extremism.\"\n\nSpeaker Johnson may come away from this vote looking rather blue to conservative voters if enough Republicans vote to vacate - but he and the rest of the GOP stand to lose the majority if Democrats manage to rally their base and convince enough independent voters that they are the more moderate, cooler heads in the room.\n\nThe Democrats aren't the only ones likely to protect Speaker Johnson; several Republicans have said they wouldn't vote to vacate. Johnson himself has been both critical and dismissive of Greene's threats, as might be expected, and Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York called the motion political theater, adding that \"it's time to move on and to move past this kind of nonsense.\" Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, called it a distraction and a mistake. Dan Crenshaw of Texas accused Greene of just looking for \"her time in the spotlight,\" calling the motion \"one last ditch effort to get attention.\" Rep. Bob Good of Virginia said his Peach State colleague isn't \"acting in the best interest of Donald Trump.\"\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, RNC Chair Michael Whatley is calling for party unity in opposition to Greene's motion. \"We need to flip the Senate, and we need to expand our majority in the House,\" he said. \"We're not going to do that if we're not unified.\"\n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) called Greene's attempt to remove Johnson as speaker disgusting. \"Ninety-eight percent of us find it disgusting,\" he said. \"I just try to ignore it. I can't help what she does. I think we'll overwhelmingly oppose it, and I think even on the Democrat side, we'll have a lot of support. We're tired of the chaos. We're tired of the anarchy.\" Matt Gaetz of Florida wasn't as critical of Greene as the others, but he did say that he didn't think the chaos of another battle for the speakership would be good for the House or the party - especially this close to Election Day.\n\nOutside of the House, GOP Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina called Ms. Greene \"uninformed,\" \"a horrible leader,\" and a \"total waste of time.\" He added: \"She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said her plan to oust Johnson is \"utterly ridiculous\" and warned that it might damage the Republican Party itself.\n\nCould Bacon be on point with his 98% estimate? Perhaps - but then again, perhaps not. About half a dozen House Republicans have spoken out in criticism of the motion to vacate - and only two other GOP representatives, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Arizona's Paul Gosar, have openly aligned with Greene. Out of 217 Republicans, that leaves a lot of undeclared intention to account for.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is determined to be the ringmaster.\n\nIn a blistering Wednesday news conference on the Capitol steps, Greene vowed to force a vote on the motion to eject Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana as speaker of the House.\n\nGreene filed the motion to vacate in late March but waited to call for a vote. In Wednesday's news conference she said that was a warning Johnson didn't heed.\n\n\"I was controlled. I was responsible,\" Greene insisted. \"I was being conscious and caring about my conference and our majority.\"\n\nBut Greene doesn't care about the Republican majority. If she did, she would've listened to nearly every one of her Republican colleagues and other top Republican officials who urged her not to take this path. The lack of party unity could put the Republican majority in jeopardy.\n\nAccording to Politico, Greene met face to face with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley the day before her announcement. The chairman emphasized to the outlet that \"nothing is more important than party unity and ensuring that we are focused on beating Joe Biden and Democrats in November.\"\n\nAnd while Greene insists she's tilting at the \"motion to vacate\" windmill out of concern for her party and the MAGA agenda, even former President Donald Trump urged her to back off. In a joint appearance with Johnson less than a month ago, Trump told the media that \"I stand with the speaker\" and urged his critics to focus on \"much bigger problems.\"\n\nIf that isn't enough, Greene's motion doesn't even meet her own standards for forcing legislation to the floor, because it isn't supported by a majority of her Republican colleagues.\n\nAs recently as last month, Greene chastised Johnson for violating what's known as the \"Hastert Rule\" -- an informal policy that the speaker doesn't allow legislation to the floor until it's favored by the majority of the majority party. \"A Republican speaker doesn't do that,\" she said.\n\nIn October, Greene warned then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, explicitly urging him to \"not violate the Hastert Rule.\"\n\nBut when the House gavels in next week, Greene is expected to force a vote on the motion to vacate. It will fail when a majority of House Republicans and even a number of House Democrats vote against it, as Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York recently promised.\n\nThe House of Representatives is a 435-seat body. When one of its members goes rogue and demands their way or the highway and works to sabotage efforts toward productivity and consensus, that member is bucking the way the founders designed Congress to work.\n\nGreene's record indicates a determination to slow Congress' work for the American people. During her first term in 2021, she repeatedly forced unnecessary votes and motions to adjourn to delay legislation she didn't like, irritating even her Republican colleagues in the process.\n\nShe's used every tool at her disposal to delay or block bipartisan legislation, whether for foreign aid or just funding the government. Tactics like Greene's are why the 118th Congress is on track to be the least productive in modern history.\n\nMost House Republicans, including Johnson, seem to be waking up to the reality that with a razor-thin majority, they'll have to reach across the aisle to allay any of the problems the American people face.\n\nAfter all, \"congress\" literally means \"the act or action of coming together and meeting.\"\n\nGreene's objections may be loud and incendiary, but if Republicans see her antics for what they are and choose instead to put partisanship aside for good faith conversations, her governing style can fade into irrelevance and elected officials can finally get back to work.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, effectively ensuring Johnson won't lose his job.\n\nJohnson will meet privately with Greene at her request at 3:30 p.m. ET on Monday, according to sources familiar.\n\nA failed vote will give Johnson an opportunity to argue that it is time to move on from the issue. But support from Democrats will open Johnson up to even more criticism from his right flank.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many Republicans will vote against Johnson - the higher the number, the more of a blow it could prove to be to the speaker's standing within the House GOP conference.\n\nGreene has said she will force a vote in the coming days, escalating pressure on Johnson and setting up a major showdown on the House floor. Even if the vote fails, as expected, it still threatens to intensify divisions among House Republicans, who control a razor-thin majority.\n\nMany Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson and do not want to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.\n\nGreene and other hardline conservatives, however, have been highly critical of Johnson's speakership. Conservative anger at Johnson intensified after he worked to help pass a major foreign aid package with assistance for Ukraine last month.\n\nJohnson has defended his leadership against the threat, saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" the speaker said in a statement after Greene announced she would move forward with a vote.\n\nTwo other Republicans are publicly supporting Greene's motion to vacate: GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\n\n\"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job - our job is to vote,\" Greene said at a news conference where she announced she would trigger a vote.\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" the congresswoman said, \"that's a list of names - and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\nGreene has been dangling the threat of an ouster vote for weeks. She originally filed the motion to oust Johnson in March amid conservative anger over his handling of the government funding fight.\n\nThe congresswoman also has not ruled out the possibility of forcing repeated votes in the future after the coming vote.\n\n\"I haven't made a decision on that yet,\" she said at the news conference.\n\nA floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed, but a motion to table - or kill - the resolution is expected to be offered and voted on first.\n\nHouse GOP leaders plan to quickly take up and kill Greene's motion, according to GOP sources. Depending on attendance, they could vote the same day she offers it.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass the foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table if the issue arose.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not commit last week to having Democrats save Johnson from multiple attempts to oust him if conservatives trigger repeated votes in the future.\n\nJeffries said the Democratic caucus \"will take it one step at a time.\"\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (CA) seven months ago, and after a series of moves by the current speaker, Mike Johnson (LA), some Republicans are ready to oust him, too.\n\nThis latest endeavor is being led by Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA), who called for a vote to vacate in late March but had yet to pull the trigger. She has been vocally upset after a series of broken promises by Speaker Johnson pushed her to the edge. She isn't alone. Republicans are frustrated because Johnson has made promises but seems to have underdelivered.\n\nAs The Federalist's Sean Davis opines, perhaps somewhat unfairly: \"Mike Johnson responded to FBI corruption by giving them a new HQ, to Biden lawfare by fully funding DOJ, to border insanity by spending billions on migration assistance, to Hamas's attack on Israel by giving them a $9 billion earmark, and to college communism by enacting speech codes. He is the single most incompetent politician I have ever seen.\"\n\nMost of these points hit home. However, it's also true that Mike Johnson has the challenge of trying to herd a fractious party with only a one-vote majority, and that means wheeling and dealing must be done.\n\nGreene and her Republican supporters Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ) are the only ones who have publicly supported an ouster. On Wednesday, Greene and Massie gave a press conference in which they expressed their disappointment in how the speaker is running business. Greene accused Johnson of being the leader of the \"uniparty\" and sharing the gavel with Democrat Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (NY). That apparently was demonstrated by Johnson putting forth a foreign aid bill in support of Ukraine.\n\nOn the flip side, let's be frank: Greene is a firebrand but also a lawmaker \u00e0 la AOC that few take seriously. This is partially because she tends to be very theatrical in her presentations and seems only interested in \"The MTG Show.\" She doesn't necessarily act in the best interests of conservatives.\n\nGreene and Massie ended their press conference by saying they'd give Republicans the weekend to decide how they were going to vote because Greene is going to push the motion to vacate next week. In the meantime, she encouraged Johnson to resign.\n\nFor their part, House Democrats released a statement saying that if the motion to vacate came to the floor, they would join with Republicans to table it and essentially block the effort. Since many Republicans would understandably prefer not to be plunged back into the chaos of having to choose yet another speaker, it's likely that this intervention by the Democrats will save Johnson, at least for now. Unfortunately, that means Johnson will have to continue relying on Democrats to pass legislation, and they will extract a price for their cooperation.\n\nJohnson responded to the Greene press conference by saying: \"I don't spend a lot of time thinking about her. I got to do my job, and we do the right thing, and we let the chips fall where they may. That is my philosophy. That is how we are governing. ... We are going to keep the train on the tracks and show the American people not just what we are against, but what we are for. That there is a conservative agenda that is necessary to get the country back on the right track, and the way for us to do that is to keep and grow the House majority.\"\n\nWe shall see where the chips fall next week. The chaos and embarrassment of ousting another speaker and stopping the work of the House to elect a new one doesn't seem like it's in the best interest of the microscopic Republican majority or the American people, but neither does advancing the Democrats' agenda without more of a fight.", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Patriot Post"}, "authors": [],

Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks during a Congressional Gold Medal presentation ceremony at the Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 21, 2024. (Right) Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) speaks to reporters outside of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington on March 13, 2024. (Alex Wong, Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will face a vote to strip him of the gavel in the coming days. While he's expected to survive the ouster bid, the move presents another test for the Republican leader as he presides over a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber.\n\nHouse Democrat leaders said they would vote to shelve a motion to vacate advanced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), effectively ensuring its defeat on the House floor.\n\nWhile Mr. Johnson could claim a victory from this scenario, he may also face further scrutiny from the right flank for having to rely on Democrats to save his speakership.\n\nMs. Greene, who is publicly supported by two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), first offered the motion to vacate in March to serve as a \"warning\" after the speaker advanced a $1.2 trillion government funding bill with broad Democrat support.\n\nSince then, Mr. Johnson's vote against adding a warrant requirement to a bill reauthorizing controversial surveillance powers and his take up of a $95 billion foreign aid bill funding Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific that didn't include border security measures stirred outrage among some conservatives, including Ms. Greene.\n\nMr. Massie, who joined Ms. Greene at a May 1 press conference when she announced she'll activate the motion to vacate in the week of May 5, defended the Georgia Republican.\n\n\"I think she's gone about this in a very reasonable way. She's given the speaker multiple chances to resign, to leave. And instead, he's clinging to power by clinging to Democrats,\" he said.\n\nUndaunted that Democrats are poised to protect Mr. Johnson by voting to table her motion, Ms. Greene said, \"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job -- our job is to vote.\"\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" she said, \"that's a list of names -- and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\nMr. Johnson responded to Ms. Greene's announcement, calling it a \"dangerous gambit\" that would throw Congress into dysfunction.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" the speaker said in a statement on May 1.\n\nMany Republicans have echoed this sentiment, apparently not eager for a repeat of last October when eight Republicans voted with all Democrats to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), throwing the House into weeks of paralysis before Mr. Johnson was elected.\n\nRep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) said he thought the procedure was being used improperly. \"I don't think you enact a motion to vacate in the manner that it's [being] done; it's as serious as impeachment. There should be at least some standards, moral standards, such as if someone were to engage in an unethical action, or crime,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't believe that's what the country wants,\" Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-Texas) said. The Texas lawmaker also said she thought Mr. Johnson deserved the support of the Republican Party.\n\nWhen House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and other Democrat leaders announced they would shield Mr. Johnson from Ms. Greene's effort to oust him, they cited the speaker's help in passing the $95 billion foreign aid package.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" they said in an April 30 statement.\n\nHouse Democrats were told to vote their conscience on the issue. Many were on board with the plan to protect the Republican speaker.\n\n\"I'm definitely open towards making sure that speaker Johnson continues,\" Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) said.\n\nRep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) went a bit further. \"I think there will be Democrats who would rather reward a speaker for doing the right thing than reward Marjorie Taylor Greene, and her effort to overtake the House,\" he said.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) expressed reservations about killing the motion to vacate: \"Now is certainly not the time to vacate the speaker's chair,\" he said. The Georgia representative said he was troubled by some of Mr. Johnson's viewpoints, saying they were almost enough to disqualify him as Speaker of the House.\n\n\"But he is our speaker,\" he said, \"And he has acted responsibly by bringing the supplemental appropriations bill to the floor of the House at personal peril.\"\n\nRep. Annie Kuster (D-Pa.), in voicing her support for tabling the motion to vacate, criticized Ms. Greene, who is known for unapologetically speaking her mind. \"She's been a thorn in our side for a long time; now she's a thorn in [the GOP's] side,\" Ms. Kuster said. \"So, I'm thrilled to take the position that she is a paper tiger, she doesn't speak for anyone, she can't count, and she doesn't have the votes.\"\n\nBut other Democrats were wary of bailing out Mr. Johnson.\n\n\"If you're asking me, 'Do I believe Democrats should help Mike Johnson?' I do not ... he is very right-wing. I don't know why I'd support that,\" said Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.)\n\n\"Frankly, if he stays in office at the sufferance of Democrats, he's a marked man in his own party,\" he added.\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) spoke even more firmly: \"Mike Johnson is absolutely against everything that I believe in,\" she said. \"There is no way I would vote for someone like him to be able to stay in his seat. Let the Republicans, and maybe others do that, but that won't be me.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Greene brings the motion to the floor, leadership will be required to hold a vote on it within a few days. Normally, a motion to vacate requires a simple majority to pass, but in this case, a member is expected to bring up a motion to table the measure. This is likely to succeed, which would put off a formal vote on the issue altogether.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Greene Could Trigger Motion to Vacate on Monday", "body": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., could trigger her motion to vacate the House speakership on Monday, a source told Newsmax Senior Congressional Correspondent Kilmeny Duchardt.\n\nBefore filing a motion, Greene will meet with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., at 3:30 p.m. ET Monday, Duchardt added.\n\nGreene on Wednesday said she would trigger her motion this week to remove Johnson from the speakership. In late March, she formally filed a motion to remove the speaker due to his support of the $1.2 trillion spending bill.\n\nGreene and several other conservatives wanted Congress to address border security before providing foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\n\"We need leaders in the House of Representatives that are going to get this done,\" Greene said Wednesday. \"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job.\"\n\nGreene, a strong supporter of Donald Trump, is going against the wishes of the former president.\n\nTrump last month offered words of praise for Johnson, saying he is \"trying very hard\" and is \"a very good person.\"\n\n\"Look, we have a majority of one [in the House],\" Trump said. \"It's not like he can go and do whatever he wants. I think he's a very good person. I think he's a very good man. I think he's trying very hard. And, again, we have to have a very big election to increase the Republican majority in the House.\"\n\nJohnson, in his own statement, said Greene's move was \"wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nDemocrats see in Johnson a potential partner, a staunch conservative who nevertheless is willing to lead his Republican Party away from the far-right voices obstructing the routine business of governing, including funding the government and, more recently, supporting Ukraine and other U.S. allies overseas.\n\nThe Democrat leader, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, and his team issued a joint statement last week saying it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP chaos, announcing that the Democrats would vote to table Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's office, essentially ensuring Johnson is not evicted from office -- at least on this attempt.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nCharlie McCarthy \u2709 Charlie McCarthy, a writer/editor at Newsmax, has nearly 40 years of experience covering news, sports, and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_mccarthy@newsmax.com", "name": "Charlie McCarthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=ed10c231-1443-4067-8bc3-c2d7f71b9b78&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) will meet with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) Monday afternoon as the Georgia Republican vows to force a vote on the GOP leader's ouster, two sources familiar with the matter told The Hill.\n\nThe meeting is set to take place at 3:30 p.m. eastern time, one source said. Greene requested the conversation, the source noted.\n\nGreene announced last week that she would move to force a vote on Johnson's ouster this week, after dangling her motion to vacate resolution over his head for more than a month.\n\nHer effort, however, is all but sure to fail. A growing number of conservative Republicans have said they do not support the motion to vacate despite their frustrations with the Speaker's recent legislative moves, and top House Democrats said they will vote to table the removal resolution if Greene calls it to the floor for a vote, two dynamics that are eroding support for Greene's gambit.\n\nOnly two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Paul Gosar (Ariz.) -- have publicly expressed support for Greene's motion to vacate.\n\nBut the GOP firebrand is, nonetheless, plowing ahead with her campaign, heaping sharp criticism on Johnson and arguing that all Republicans should be put on the record regarding whether they support the Speaker.\n\n\"House Republicans know this is true and Hakeem Jeffries started controlling the House when Johnson became Speaker. Anyone that hears this and still defends Mike Johnson's Speakership is ok with Uniparty control,\" Greene wrote on X.\n\nJohnson, for his part, has remained defiant in the face of Greene's ouster threat, brushing it aside as the incorrect play call for the current moment.\n\n\"I don't think too much about the motion to vacate,\" Johnson said on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" Friday. \"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country. These are very serious times that we're living in, and the American people need and deserve a functioning Congress, and I think that is the prevailing factor here.\"\n\nGreene has condemned Johnson for cutting a number of deals with Democrats this year, including legislation to fund the government, a bill to reauthorize the U.S.'s warrantless surveillance authority and, most recently, a foreign aid package that included billions of dollars for Ukraine.\n\nThe Georgia Republican, however, also aimed her fire at Johnson after Punchbowl News reported Monday morning that the Speaker signaled during a donor retreat that he would support booting members from their committees if they vote against party-line procedural votes.\n\nOne of the sources who spoke to The Hill confirmed that message, but noted that the remarks were hypothetical any moves would not occur until the next Congress.\n\nGreene -- who was removed from her committees shortly after coming to Congress in 2021 for endorsing conspiracy theories, racist dogma and violence against Democratic politicians -- slammed Johnson for the reported plans.\n\n\"Speaker Mike Johnson is talking about kicking Republican members off of committees if we vote against his rules/bills. This comes after he's serving Chuck Schumer and Biden's every single wish and passing major bills with Democrats and not the majority of Republicans! It's not us who is out of line, it's our Republican elected Speaker!!\" she wrote on X.\n\n\"By the way, being kicked off committees is nothing new for me. Badge of honor,\" she continued in the social media post. \"Don't threaten me with a good time.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mychael_schnell@thehill.com", "name": "Mychael Schnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/IMG_1918.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) may come to a head this week once the conservative firebrand pushes to force a vote for the ouster of the GOP leadership.\n\nIn March, Green filed a motion to vacate against Johnson. This week, she vowed to force a vote on the resolution she filed. Greene has been openly criticizing the legislative decisions of the GOP leader at almost every instance.\n\nDespite all the efforts that Greene put into the ouster of Johnson, there is no guarantee that it will succeed once voted upon. There is a large number of conservative Republicans who do not plan to support her motion, but were in fact opposed to it.\n\nAccording to The Hill, there were only two representatives who were supporting Greene's motion. In addition, the top three Democrats in the House will also be voting to table the said plan.\n\nOn Friday, Greene wrote on X that \"Mike Johnson must resign or be removed.\" Her statement simply signifies that there is no stopping her until she gets to put her motion to a vote this week.\n\nCNN reported that there is no exact figure when it comes to the number of Republicans who will support Greene's motion. Obviously, if there would be more Republicans who will vote against Johnson, it could prove a blow to his standing within the GOP conference. In the event that the vote would fail, the division among House Republicans would only escalate further.\n\nReports revealed that Greene is not the only one who got highly critical of Johnson's speakership. Perhaps, what further fueled the anger of a number of hardline conservatives was when Johnson worked on helping pass a foreign aid package that was with assistance for Ukraine in April.\n\nWhile he may have been confronted with a force from within the GOP itself, Johnson has stood his ground, defended his leadership, and categorically stated that he will not resign. He also warned that putting forth to a vote the motion to vacate and to oust him from the speakership might only lead to chaos in the House.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" said the speaker in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_resuma@ibtimes.com", "name": "Ann Resuma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4524417/republican-house-speaker-mike-johnson-spoke-about-alleged-voter-fraud-during-press-conference.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Now we know if he remains Speaker with their help, he's fully compromised. Are my Republican colleagues going to allow this?

She announced she plans to call a vote on her previously unprivileged motion to vacate against House Speaker Mike Johnson, sparking criticism from several Republicans who warned the move may be damaging to the party.\n\nGreene introduced the motion to vacate against Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, in March after he passed a $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government. Her announcement on Wednesday came after weeks of growing frustration among House conservatives, who have expressed disappointment with Johnson over the spending package and for holding a vote on legislation to send aid to Ukraine.\n\nShe also broke from the majority of her party by opposing the Antisemitism Awareness Act, a bill that would require the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing anti-discrimination laws. She voted against the bill over concerns it could make parts of the Bible illegal, she wrote to X.\n\nRepresentative Mike Lawler, a New York Republican representing a Democratic-leaning congressional district won by President Joe Biden in 2020, criticized Greene in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday over her stance on the act, which he sponsored.\n\nGreene posted a critique of Lawler's legislation, which she described as a \"free speech killing bill,\" and his support for expelling former New York Representative George Santos in December 2023.\n\n\"And yet in both instances, more than two thirds of Congress voted with me. The bill simply codifies President Trump's executive order into law -- it does not ban the Bible or limit free speech. #MoscowMarjorie has gone off the deep end -- maybe the result of a space laser,\" Lawler responded, referring to a conspiracy theory that Greene once promoted in a now-deleted Facebook post\n\nNewsweek reached out to Greene's office for comment via email.\n\nHere is a list of other House Republicans who have criticized Representative Greene in recent days:\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who also represents a Biden-won district, told reporters this week that most Republicans find her effort to remove Johnson \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"Ninety-eight percent of us find it disgusting,\" he said. \"I just try to ignore it. I can't help what she does. I think we'll overwhelmingly oppose it, and I think even on the Democrat side, we'll have a lot of support. We're tired of the chaos. We're tired of the anarchy.\"\n\nWhile Johnson has largely praised Greene in the past, he has become more critical of the Georgia conservative in recent days. In a statement reported by Punchbowl News' Jake Sherman, Johnson said Greene's motion is \"wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nIn an interview with NewsNation on Wednesday, Johnson also said Greene is not \"proving to be\" a serious lawmaker.\n\nRepresentative Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican, criticized Greene in April for her political \"theater\" in remarks to CNN.\n\n\"Her theater and this constant effort to hold the Congress hostage has to come to an end. I'm going to have no part in it. And a good number of my colleagues, conservative and moderate, believe that enough is enough. It is time to move on and to move past this kind of nonsense,\" he said.\n\nRepresentative Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, told CNN this week that he believes the motion to vacate is a \"distraction\" and \"mistake.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, criticized Greene on CNN last week, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\n\nGreene previously said that she doesn't \"give a rat's ass\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" Greene said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Like the Republican choice for president, there are many other viable options for House speaker.\n\nRepresentatives who are zealous but sound, passionate, but not conspiracy theorists who think the election is rigged and the FBI is spying on everyone.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

But who talks about it at the dinner table like it's a normal, regular thing? It's one thing for the people of Georgia to want her as a representative, that's their prerogative, but for the rest of the GOP to consider her as a leader in the House is another thing entirely.\n\nI've been asking myself the same question since Jan. 6, 2021: Aren't Republicans better than this? Marjorie Taylor Greene in a leadership position suggests they're not after all.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

She announced she plans to call a vote on her previously unprivileged motion to vacate against House Speaker Mike Johnson, sparking criticism from several Republicans who warned the move may be damaging to the party.\n\nGreene introduced the motion to vacate against Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, in March after he passed a $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government. Her announcement on Wednesday came after weeks of growing frustration among House conservatives, who have expressed disappointment with Johnson over the spending package and for holding a vote on legislation to send aid to Ukraine.\n\nShe also broke from the majority of her party by opposing the Antisemitism Awareness Act, a bill that would require the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing anti-discrimination laws. She voted against the bill over concerns it could make parts of the Bible illegal, she wrote to X.\n\nRepresentative Mike Lawler, a New York Republican representing a Democratic-leaning congressional district won by President Joe Biden in 2020, criticized Greene in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday over her stance on the act, which he sponsored.\n\nGreene posted a critique of Lawler's legislation, which she described as a \"free speech killing bill,\" and his support for expelling former New York Representative George Santos in December 2023.\n\n\"And yet in both instances, more than two thirds of Congress voted with me. The bill simply codifies President Trump's executive order into law -- it does not ban the Bible or limit free speech. #MoscowMarjorie has gone off the deep end -- maybe the result of a space laser,\" Lawler responded, referring to a conspiracy theory that Greene once promoted in a now-deleted Facebook post\n\nNewsweek reached out to Greene's office for comment via email.\n\nHere is a list of other House Republicans who have criticized Representative Greene in recent days:\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who also represents a Biden-won district, told reporters this week that most Republicans find her effort to remove Johnson \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"Ninety-eight percent of us find it disgusting,\" he said. \"I just try to ignore it. I can't help what she does. I think we'll overwhelmingly oppose it, and I think even on the Democrat side, we'll have a lot of support. We're tired of the chaos. We're tired of the anarchy.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson\n\nWhile Johnson has largely praised Greene in the past, he has become more critical of the Georgia conservative in recent days. In a statement reported by Punchbowl News' Jake Sherman, Johnson said Greene's motion is \"wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nIn an interview with NewsNation on Wednesday, Johnson also said Greene is not \"proving to be\" a serious lawmaker.\n\nRepresentative Marc Molinaro\n\nRepresentative Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican, criticized Greene in April for her political \"theater\" in remarks to CNN.\n\n\"Her theater and this constant effort to hold the Congress hostage has to come to an end. I'm going to have no part in it. And a good number of my colleagues, conservative and moderate, believe that enough is enough. It is time to move on and to move past this kind of nonsense,\" he said.\n\nRepresentative Andy Ogles\n\nRepresentative Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, told CNN this week that he believes the motion to vacate is a \"distraction\" and \"mistake.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, criticized Greene on CNN last week, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\n\nGreene previously said that she doesn't \"give a rat's ass\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" Greene said.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She is trying to wreck the GOP.\"\n\nMs. Peek led off by writing, \"It's high time someone in the Republican Party told Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to turn all that bombastic self-serving showmanship and drama queen energy on Democrats, and stop trying to defeat her own party.\"\n\nMs. Peeke added, \"The internal squabbles of the party need to stop. If Marjorie Taylor Greene and others want to oppose aid to Ukraine or the FISA bill, they can vote against it. That's how democracy works. My message for MTG? Borrowing from Hillary Clinton: Get over yourself. The mission today is to elect Donald Trump.\"\n\nMost House Republicans, save for Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona, are against Ms. Greene's move to boot Mr. Johnson.\n\nBut the growing criticism from within the GOP, along with former President Donald Trump throwing support behind the speaker, has not killed Ms. Greene's desire to send Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, packing.\n\nIndeed, her rebuttal on \"War Room\" came after she finally pulled the trigger on her motion to vacate the chair, setting the date for a vote next week. Democrats have promised to save Mr. Johnson, an outcome Ms. Greene believes is a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"The beautiful thing about it is Democrats have to come clean; they were controlling Mike Johnson anyway,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_miller@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Alex Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/05/03/Pictures_of_the_Week_Global_Photo_Gallery_87029_c0-179-4300-2686_s1770x1032.jpg?fe1e0fa867cb205304efa5b208dcc277e76c1ccb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene will meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday ahead of a planned vote to oust him -- and following reports that he is considering kicking GOP rebels off of their committees.\n\nJohnson (R-La.) has brushed off the looming threat to remove him as Republican leader, and revealed to donors during a Sunday retreat at the Four Seasons in Washington that he supported disciplining members who kamikaze their own party's procedural votes\n\nOn Saturday, former President Donald Trump hosted Johnson at his Mar-a-Lago estate for the Republican National Committee's annual spring fundraiser, at which Trump \"emphasized the need for party unity, collaboration, and expanding the GOP's House Majority,\" according to a campaign readout.\n\nA Capitol Hill source told The Post that the speaker's Sunday remarks on Republican conference rules were a \"hypothetical\" that Johnson is entertaining for the next Congress.\n\nPunchbowl News first reported Johnson's comments.\n\n\"Speaker Mike Johnson is talking about kicking Republican members off of committees if we vote against his rules/bills,\" Greene (R-Ga.) posted Monday morning on X.\n\n\"This comes after he's serving Chuck Schumer and Biden's every single wish and passing major bills with Democrats and not the majority of Republicans!\" she railed. \"It's not us who is out of line, it's our Republican elected Speaker!!\"\n\nJohnson's office confirmed to The Post that he will sit down with Greene for a private meeting Monday afternoon.\n\n\"By the way, being kicked off committees is nothing new for me,\" boasted the far-right Georgia congresswoman, who lost those positions under House Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in 2021.\n\n\"Badge of honor. Don't threaten me with a good time,\" Greene scoffed. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Hill source suggested the motion to vacate Johnson could become privileged as soon as Monday evening, when the House returns for its first votes of the week. That means the ouster of Johnson must be considered within two legislative days.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced last week that Democrats will vote to table the motion when or if it comes up for a vote.\n\nIn a Sunday interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Jeffries (D-NY) said he had not spoken with Johnson about the decision beforehand but affirmed that his caucus \"will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.\"\n\nBut 208 Democrats did exactly that on Oct. 3, when they joined a gang of eight Republicans led by far-right Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and voted to remove then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\n\"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done,\" Jeffries added. \"Those are just the facts.\"\n\nGreene and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) pointed to the remark as proof that Johnson had truly become a \"Uniparty Speaker.\"\n\n\"Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries gloats that Democrats control the House of Representatives under Mike Johnson, yet some of my Republican colleagues want to continue business as usual for the rest of the year,\" Massie said Monday morning on X.\n\nBoth announced their intention to privilege the motion to vacate, which was filed in March, citing Johnson's \"three betrayals\" of the Republican conference on votes that raised government spending, authorized warrantless surveillance of US citizens' communications with foreign nationals and sent $95 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nEach faced an uphill battle to come to the floor as part of a rule, which is typically the avenue for bills to receive votes by the governing majority but has been rarely used in the 118th Congress.\n\n\"What we need is a new Speaker willing to use our majority to wield the power of the purse for the benefit of America,\" Massie, who serves on the influential House Rules Committee, added in another X post.\n\n\"In just a few months, this Speaker has worked to give the Executive more authority and more money than even Pelosi granted,\" he said. \"Vacate this #uniparty Speaker.\"\n\nMassie defended McCarthy against his critics before the motion to vacate last year and has since frequently praised the ex-GOP House leader for being a superior fundraiser and negotiator on behalf of the Republican conference.\n\nBoth Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who also signed onto the motion to vacate Johnson, also opposed McCarthy's ouster.\n\nA top aide to one of the eight GOP lawmakers who voted McCarthy out told Politico that there is little interest in dragging the Republican conference down into another speakership fight with fewer than six months to go before House elections.\n\nTrump, 77, tried to stay above the fray during the speakership controversies, but has issued several pleas for Republican unity.\n\n\"I think he's doing a very good job,\" he said of Johnson last month before the foreign aid bill passed the House.\n\n\"He's doing about as good as you're going to do. And I'm sure that Marjorie understands that, and she's a very good friend of mine, and I know she has a lot of respect for the speaker.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, at right, are pictured.\n\nWashington CNN --\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to confront a vote over his ouster in the coming days, a pivotal moment that presents a major leadership test for the Louisiana Republican even though he is expected to prevail.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders have said that Democrats will vote to kill the effort led by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, effectively ensuring Johnson won't lose his job.\n\nA failed vote will give Johnson an opportunity to argue that it is time to move on from the issue. But support from Democrats will open Johnson up to even more criticism from his right flank.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many Republicans will vote against Johnson - the higher the number, the more of a blow it could prove to be to the speaker's standing within the House GOP conference.\n\nGreene has said she will force a vote in the coming days, escalating pressure on Johnson and setting up a major showdown on the House floor. Even if the vote fails, as expected, it still threatens to intensify divisions among House Republicans, who control a razor-thin majority.\n\nMany Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson and do not want to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.\n\nGreene and other hardline conservatives, however, have been highly critical of Johnson's speakership. Conservative anger at Johnson intensified after he worked to help pass a major foreign aid package with assistance for Ukraine last month.\n\nJohnson has defended his leadership against the threat, saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" the speaker said in a statement after Greene announced she would move forward with a vote.\n\nTwo other Republicans are publicly supporting Greene's motion to vacate: GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\n\n\"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job - our job is to vote,\" Greene said at a news conference where she announced she would trigger a vote.\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" the congresswoman said, \"that's a list of names - and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\nGreene has been dangling the threat of an ouster vote for weeks. She originally filed the motion to oust Johnson in March amid conservative anger over his handling of the government funding fight.\n\nThe congresswoman also has not ruled out the possibility of forcing repeated votes in the future after the coming vote.\n\n\"I haven't made a decision on that yet,\" she said at the news conference.\n\nA floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed, but a motion to table - or kill - the resolution is expected to be offered and voted on first.\n\nHouse GOP leaders plan to quickly take up and kill Greene's motion, according to GOP sources. Depending on attendance, they could vote the same day she offers it.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass the foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table if the issue arose.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not commit last week to having Democrats save Johnson from multiple attempts to oust him if conservatives trigger repeated votes in the future.\n\nJeffries said the Democratic caucus \"will take it one step at a time.\"", "source": {"uri":

She argued that \"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job. He has proven it over and over again\"\n\nShe also said \"I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may and so next week, I am going to be calling this motion to vacate\"\n\nRT reports: Taylor Greene had previously threatened to take action against Johnson when GOP lawmakers demanded the White House address the southern border crisis as a condition for their backing of Biden's foreign aid bill.\n\nGreene's proposal has not gained the required majority support among fellow House Republicans, however. There were only two other Republicans, Reps Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul A Gosar of Arizona, who publicly backed her motion. Some lawmakers oppose it in the belief that \"it's not the time,\" given the upcoming presidential election.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have also dismissed Greene's attempt to oust the Republican speaker and have vowed to band together to protect Johnson by voting to kill the motion to vacate his position.\n\n\"House Democrats have aggressively pushed back against MAGA extremism.

Jerry Nadler explained on Saturday why so many Democrats are sticking up for embattled Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nAs previously reported, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is currently trying to oust Johnson with a \"motion to vacate\" because of his decision last month to move forward with a gigantic foreign aid package jampacked with money for Ukraine.\n\nBut the \"motion to vacate\" is extremely likely to fail if and when it comes up for a vote because virtually the entire Democrat Party, save for a few outcasts, has vowed to vote for Johnson.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC this Saturday, Nadler said that, while he doesn't expect Greene to actually go through with a vote, if she does go through with it, Democrats will vote for Johnson because he did the \"right thing.\"\n\nListen:\n\n\"I suspect that she won't actually carry through on the threat,\" he said. \"But we are right that if she does, we should save him. Because as much as we disagree with him on everything, almost everything, we can't permit him to be punished for doing the right thing - voting for the Ukraine aid, which is what they want to punish him for.\"\n\nSo Johnson did the \"right thing\" by making America effectively beholden to Ukraine and its losing battle against Russia.\n\nThe remarks came four days after House Democrat leaders released a joint statement vowing to back Johnson.\n\n\"From the very beginning of this Congress, House Democrats have put people over politics and found bipartisan common ground with traditional Republicans in order to deliver real results,\" the statement read.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction. We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" it continued.\n\nMeanwhile, a report emerged Saturday that an increasing number of Senate Republicans have begun calling for Greene to back off.\n\n\"It's a horrible idea,\" Sen. Roger Marshall told The Hill in regard to Greene's planned motion. \"Moses could not do a better job than what Mike Johnson is doing right now.\"\n\n\"I think he's doing the very best possible [job] in the situation with a slim majority where the Democrats control the Senate and the White House. There's not a more conservative person over there that can be elected Speaker than Mike Johnson is,\" Marshall added.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz concurred, saying, \"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive.\"\n\nThen there's Sen. Mike Braun, who told The Hill that Greene's obsession with ousting Johnson could hurt the GOP agenda.\n\nAnd there's Sen. Thom Tillis, who last month bashed Greene as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\n\"She is a horrible leader,\" he told CNN at the time. \"She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority.\"\n\nDovetailing back to the House, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna views things differently. Like Greene, she shares criticism of Johnson. But unlike Greene, she sees the bigger picture.\n\n\"The Uniparty has prioritized foreign interests again and placed America last,\" she told Newsweek. \"Speaker Johnson has gone back on most of what he said when we elected him to be Speaker, rendering him almost unrecognizable as a legislator and the leader we chose.\"\n\n\"That being said, the possibility of a Democratic-controlled House poses a greater risk. We stand as the last barrier that has stopped Biden from completely ruining our country. Given our historically narrow majority, we must not allow the gavel to pass to the Democrats,\" she added.\n\nJohnson has for his part warned that his ouster could threaten the GOP's majority.\n\n\"I don't think that would be helpful to us from a political standpoint for the Republican Party to continue to govern, maintain and keep our majority in November,\" he said. \"I think that would have been a great hindrance to it. And so, that wouldn't be helpful. Nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard, either. It would be chaos in the House.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is set to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for a one-on-one meeting as the Georgia Republican prepares to activate her motion to vacate in an effort to strip the Republican leader of the speaker's gavel.\n\nGreene will meet with Johnson at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, just hours before the House meets for its first votes of the week. It's not entirely clear what will be discussed, but it was Greene who requested the meeting, according to a source familiar.\n\nThe meeting comes as Greene is poised to notice her motion to vacate as early as Monday evening, which would bring the motion to the floor for a vote sometime in the next two days. Greene filed the motion over a month ago, holding it over Johnson's head as he plotted a path forward on foreign aid and other key pieces of legislation.\n\n\"It was a warning to stop serving the Democrats and support our Republican Conference and support our agenda,\" Greene said last week. \"And he didn't do it.\"\n\nGreene will move forward with the threat even as it seems destined to fail, with Democratic leadership vowing to oppose the motion should it be brought to the floor. Several Republican lawmakers have also rejected the proposal, likely making the motion dead on arrival.\n\nStill, Greene has refused to back down, claiming that even if the vote fails, it will put her colleagues on the record on where they stand regarding Johnson's leadership.\n\n\"[Do] members of Congress support that unity party? Is this what they support?\" Greene said. \"I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again,\" Greene added.\n\nDemocrats have pushed back on suggestions that a table to motion would indicate support for Johnson's speakership, instead posing it as a way to avoid another leaderless period in the lower chamber.\n\n\"None of the discussion that we had in caucus was about saving Mike Johnson. The underlying motion debate was not discussed. The motion to table was, and there is a distinction there,\" Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (D-CA) said on Tuesday. \"We want to turn the page and focus on the pressing issues that everyday Americans care about.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is finally moving forward with her motion to vacate -- putting the firebrand Republican at odds with many in her party, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nGreene announced she would bring the motion to the floor next week even as several Republican lawmakers have already indicated they would oppose the measure, likely making it dead on arrival as Democrats have also vowed to block the measure. However, the Georgia Republican has refused to back down even as many of her allies on the right have voiced concerns it could cost them their majority next year.\n\n\"That's exactly why we have to do this. We have to win in November. We have to have a majority in the House,\" Greene said on Wednesday. \"We're not going to have a House majority if we keep Mike Johnson.\"\n\nGreene's decision to move forward with the motion to vacate puts her at odds with Trump, who has publicly supported Johnson and has dismissed the idea of removing him. However, Greene has rejected suggestions that her motion is in defiance of the former president's wishes, arguing instead the move would boost his chances in the 2024 election.\n\n\"I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump,\" Greene said. \"That's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats. Mike Johnson has fully funded the Department of Justice that wants to put President Trump in jail, giving him a death sentence.\"\n\nJohnson pushed back against that narrative, telling SiriusXM's The Laura Coates Show on Friday that Trump is in his corner and that he would be meeting with the former president over the weekend.\n\n\"I have a long relationship with President Trump. For eight years now we've worked together very closely,\" Johnson said. \"So it's very important in that next term, when the new Congress begins in January and the new president takes office, that the speaker of the House and the president be working very closely together on the agenda to move the country forward. And we're looking forward to that opportunity.\"\n\nTrump's support of Johnson could be reflected among several of his allies on Capitol Hill, possibly alienating Greene from the former president's base despite being one of his most vocal allies.\n\n\"Everything that we do in the House of Representatives should be in the best interest of getting Donald Trump reelected,\" Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) said. \"Motions to vacate, justified or unjustified, we don't have time for that right now. Let's focus on Donald Trump.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"I think Marjorie Taylor Greene, to try to topple the speaker, increases the chances of chaos and increases the chances of handing control to the Democrats,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told RealClearPolitics Podcast. \"There is zero chance a more conservative speaker will result, and so I think what she's doing is really unhelpful to the country.\"\n\nGreene's move has also frustrated top Republican leaders, with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) speaking with the Georgia lawmaker for an extensive conversation on the House floor earlier this week. The majority leader declined to give specifics of the talk, but he told reporters they discussed the motion to vacate.\n\n\"In the end, it's her decision, but we had a conversation about it,\" Scalise said.\n\nIt's not clear what day the House will vote on the motion to vacate. However, it is expected to be a short-lived affair.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership came out against the motion to vacate on Tuesday, vowing to table the legislation should it come to the floor. That decision gives Johnson considerable cover, possibly killing the motion before it even reaches the floor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nStill, Greene has refused to back down, arguing a save from Democrats would harm their own chances of winning back the House majority.\n\n\"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again,\" Greene said.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) criticized Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) for her effort to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from his position. Greene and other House Republicans have threatened to force a vote on a motion to vacate that she filed over one month ago.\n\nShe recently announced that she would soon pursue this action despite opposition coming from Republicans and Democrats in Congress. Others have criticized her actions, arguing that the ill-fated effort distracts from other legislative priorities.\n\nDuring an appearance on the RealClearPolitics radio show, Cruz addressed the feud between Greene and Johnson, calling her effort to unseat him \"silly\" and \"counterproductive.\"\n\n\"Look, I think it is silly. I think it is seriously counterproductive. I think Mike Johnson is a strong conservative who's been given an almost impossible task. He has a tiny majority in the House, just a two-vote majority. That means any three House members run off to the hills and the majority evaporates. And I think Marjorie Taylor-Greene, to try to topple the speaker increases the chances of chaos. It increases the chances of handing control to the Democrats. And there is zero chance a more conservative speaker will result. And so I think what she's doing is really unhelpful to the country.\"\n\nDuring a Wednesday press conference with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), Greene announced her intention to force the vote on the motion. She lashed out at the speaker over issues like foreign aid to Ukraine and the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The lawmaker repeated criticisms made by others about Johnson's leadership, particularly his decision to collaborate with Democrats to pass foreign aid legislation.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie Announce Effort to Oust Speaker Mike Johnson\n\n\"He passed three continuing resolutions, and then he finally passed a two-part omnibus that fully funded Joe Biden's agenda and the Democrat agenda, funded the Department of Justice that...wants to put President Trump in jail for the rest of his life, which is a death sentence.

Pro-life Mike Johnson funded full-term abortion clinics, funded the trans agenda on children that 70 percent of Americans are completely against on both sides of the aisle and he fully funded Joe Biden's open border policies, the number one issue in America.\"\n\nJohnson clapped back at Greene during a media appearance, saying she is not a \"serious lawmaker.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson Claps Back at Marjorie Taylor Greene, Says She Is Not a 'Serious Lawmaker'\n\nJohnson's response comes as Greene declared that she would be forcing a vote on a motion to vacate to remove him as speaker. In an interview recorded Tuesday night that will air at 6 p.m. Wednesday on NewsNation's \"The Hill,\" Johnson was asked whether he believes Greene is a \"serious lawmaker.\"\n\n\"I don't think she's proving to be, no,\" Johnson said in a preview of the interview.\n\n\"I don't spend a lot of time thinking about her,\" he continued. \"I got to do my job, and we do the right thing, and we let the chips fall where they may. And that's my philosophy, that's how we're governing.\"\n\n\"We're going to keep the train on the tracks and show the American people not just what we're against, but what we're for. That there's a conservative agenda that is necessary to get the country back on the right track, and the way for us to do that is to keep and grow the House majority,\" Johnson added.\n\n\"Descending into chaos and closing the House down and vacating the chair again is exactly the opposite of what needs to happen,\" he said.\n\nAs stated previously, removing Johnson as speaker is not a likely outcome. Greene will struggle to get enough support from Republicans to approve such a move. Democrats have already indicated that they will back the speaker, at least for the time being.\n\nRELATED:", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/59/9417ca39-73c3-42da-81b6-bbea4b7b7a96.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Greene has consistently attacked Johnson for advancing bills that have attracted widespread bipartisan support, such as the government spending proposal approved in March and the foreign aid package signed into law last month.\n\nAs she called for Johnson's removal, Greene accused the speaker of abandoning his Republican principles in favor of Democratic priorities, such as Ukraine funding.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is giving [Democrats] everything they want,\" Greene said Wednesday. \"I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may. And so next week, I am going to be calling this motion to vacate.\"\n\nBut Greene's proposal is widely expected to fail, as House Democratic leaders indicated last week that they would vote to table, or kill, the motion to vacate the chair. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the three leaders cited the passage of the foreign aid package, which included nearly $61bn in funding for Ukraine, to justify their stance.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" the leaders said. \"We will vote to table Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate the chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nAmong House Republicans, Greene's campaign has attracted little interest, as only two of her colleagues - Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona - have expressed their support of the motion.\n\nAlthough the effort will almost certainly fail, Greene can still force a vote on her motion to vacate. Current House rules stipulate that a single member of the chamber may \"offer a privileged resolution declaring the Office of Speaker vacant\". Greene introduced such a resolution in March, but she stopped short of calling for a vote on the matter.\n\nGreene plans to move forward with requesting a vote on the motion, which will force the House to take up the matter within two legislative days.\n\nBefore voting on removing the speaker, one of Johnson's allies is expected to introduce a motion to table the proposal. When then speaker Kevin McCarthy was facing the threat of removal in October, his allies tried the same tactic, but the motion to table failed in a vote of 208 to 218.\n\nThis time around, the House will almost certainly be able to pass a motion to table Greene's resolution. With House Democratic leadership signaling that they will support the motion to table and only two Republican colleagues joining Greene's cause, she remains hundreds of votes short of the majority that she will need to remove the speaker. (However, Democrats are not expected to unanimously back the motion to table, as some have signaled they will oppose it or vote \"present\".)\n\nJohnson himself has appeared largely unbothered by Greene's threats, criticizing her motion as \"wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country\". At a press conference on Tuesday, Johnson insisted that he remained laser-focused on advancing House Republicans' legislative priorities.\n\n\"I have to do my job. We have to do what we believe to be the right thing,\" Johnson said. \"We need people who are serious about the job here to continue to do that job and get it done.\"\n\nIf Johnson were ousted, he would become only the second House speaker in US history to be formally removed from the position - and yet he would also be the second speaker removed in less than a year. In October, a small group of Republicans joined Democrats in ousting McCarthy, making him the first House speaker to ever endure that humiliation.\n\nMcCarthy's departure set off weeks of chaos in the House, as Republicans repeatedly failed in their efforts to choose a new speaker. The House remained at a complete standstill for three weeks, unable to conduct any official business, until Johnson (the conference's fourth speaker nominee) won election.\n\nJohnson has often referenced that embarrassing episode in recent weeks, as he has attempted to dissuade Republicans from joining Greene's campaign.\n\n\"We saw what happened with the motion to vacate the last time,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"Congress was closed for three weeks. No one can afford for that to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joan@theguardian.com", "name": "Joan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6bfadd88482fadb0b3c8e283a0cb399b30ce510/0_189_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ccf385c23adbd5ad27ed9693a6125d0c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is finally moving forward with her motion to vacate -- putting the firebrand Republican at odds with many in her party, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nGreene announced she would bring the motion to the floor next week even as several Republican lawmakers have already indicated they would oppose the measure, likely making it dead on arrival as Democrats have also vowed to block the measure. However, the Georgia Republican has refused to back down even as many of her allies on the right have voiced concerns it could cost them their majority next year.\n\n\"That's exactly why we have to do this. We have to win in November. We have to have a majority in the House,\" Greene said on Wednesday. \"We're not going to have a House majority if we keep Mike Johnson.\"\n\nGreene's decision to move forward with the motion to vacate puts her at odds with Trump, who has publicly supported Johnson and has dismissed the idea of removing him. However, Greene has rejected suggestions that her motion is in defiance of the former president's wishes, arguing instead the move would boost his chances in the 2024 election.\n\n\"I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump,\" Greene said. \"That's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats. Mike Johnson has fully funded the Department of Justice that wants to put President Trump in jail, giving him a death sentence.\"\n\nJohnson pushed back against that narrative, telling SiriusXM's The Laura Coates Show on Friday that Trump is in his corner and that he would be meeting with the former president over the weekend.\n\n\"I have a long relationship with President Trump. For eight years now we've worked together very closely,\" Johnson said. \"So it's very important in that next term, when the new Congress begins in January and the new president takes office, that the speaker of the House and the president be working very closely together on the agenda to move the country forward. And we're looking forward to that opportunity.\"\n\nTrump's support of Johnson could be reflected among several of his allies on Capitol Hill, possibly alienating Greene from the former president's base despite being one of his most vocal allies.\n\n\"Everything that we do in the House of Representatives should be in the best interest of getting Donald Trump reelected,\" Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) said. \"Motions to vacate, justified or unjustified, we don't have time for that right now. Let's focus on Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I think Marjorie Taylor Greene, to try to topple the speaker, increases the chances of chaos and increases the chances of handing control to the Democrats,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told RealClearPolitics Podcast. \"There is zero chance a more conservative speaker will result, and so I think what she's doing is really unhelpful to the country.\"\n\nGreene's move has also frustrated top Republican leaders, with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) speaking with the Georgia lawmaker for an extensive conversation on the House floor earlier this week. The majority leader declined to give specifics of the talk, but he told reporters they discussed the motion to vacate.\n\n\"In the end, it's her decision, but we had a conversation about it,\" Scalise said.\n\nIt's not clear what day the House will vote on the motion to vacate. However, it is expected to be a short-lived affair.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership came out against the motion to vacate on Tuesday, vowing to table the legislation should it come to the floor. That decision gives Johnson considerable cover, possibly killing the motion before it even reaches the floor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nStill, Greene has refused to back down, arguing a save from Democrats would harm their own chances of winning back the House majority.\n\n\"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again,\" Greene said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cami_mondeaux@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Cami Mondeaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Nehls", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Nehls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24122573233535-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is set to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for a one-on-one meeting as the Georgia Republican prepares to activate her motion to vacate in an effort to strip the Republican leader of the speaker's gavel.\n\nGreene will meet with Johnson at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, just hours before the House meets for its first votes of the week. It's not entirely clear what will be discussed, but it was Greene who requested the meeting, according to a source familiar.\n\nThe meeting comes as Greene is poised to notice her motion to vacate as early as Monday evening, which would bring the motion to the floor for a vote sometime in the next two days. Greene filed the motion over a month ago, holding it over Johnson's head as he plotted a path forward on foreign aid and other key pieces of legislation.\n\n\"It was a warning to stop serving the Democrats and support our Republican Conference and support our agenda,\" Greene said last week. \"And he didn't do it.\"\n\nGreene will move forward with the threat even as it seems destined to fail, with Democratic leadership vowing to oppose the motion should it be brought to the floor. Several Republican lawmakers have also rejected the proposal, likely making the motion dead on arrival.\n\nStill, Greene has refused to back down, claiming that even if the vote fails, it will put her colleagues on the record on where they stand regarding Johnson's leadership.\n\n\"[Do] members of Congress support that unity party? Is this what they support?\" Greene said. \"I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again,\" Greene added.\n\nDemocrats have pushed back on suggestions that a table to motion would indicate support for Johnson's speakership, instead posing it as a way to avoid another leaderless period in the lower chamber.\n\n\"None of the discussion that we had in caucus was about saving Mike Johnson. The underlying motion debate was not discussed. The motion to table was, and there is a distinction there,\" Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (D-CA) said on Tuesday. \"We want to turn the page and focus on the pressing issues that everyday Americans care about. And spending time on this just doesn't make sense to us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe vote could also put Greene at odds with former President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress, as the former president has come out in support of Johnson's leadership. However, Greene has rejected suggestions she is defying Trump's wishes, arguing she is the former president's strongest supporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt's not clear when the motion to vacate will be brought to the floor. If Greene notices the measure on Monday evening, GOP leaders can schedule a vote as early as Tuesday.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

She announced the motion to vacate in March after Johnson worked with Democrats to pass a bill to fund the government, but has grown increasingly critical of Johnson after he also passed a bipartisan bill to secure foreign aid for U.S. allies including Ukraine and Israel in their ongoing war against Russia and Hamas, respectively.\n\nJohnson can only afford two GOP defectors in the vote due to his party's razor-thin majority, assuming all Republicans are present. Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona have said they support Greene's motion to vacate. However, Democratic leadership has signaled they are planning to vacate the motion, potentially saving Johnson's leadership.\n\nGood, a Virginia Republican, issued a warning about the effort to oust Johnson in an interview on NewsNation's The Hill Sunday.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing. She doesn't lead anyone,\" he told host Chris Stirewalt. \"She's not acting in the best interests of President Trump.\"\n\nHe added that he does not believe trying to remove Johnson is a \"good move six months before an election\" and that Greene has \"always been about herself primarily.\"\n\nWhile Greene is a key Trump ally, the former president, who is the presumptive Republican 2024 presidential nominee, has not signaled support for ousting Johnson. Trump has been fairly complimentary toward Johnson, saying after a meeting between the two last month he is \"getting along very well\" with the House speaker.\n\n\"It's not an easy situation for any speaker. I think he's doing a very good job. He's doing about as good as you're going to do,\" Trump said in April. \"I'm sure that Marjorie understands that. She's a very good friend of mine, and I know she has a lot of respect for the speaker.\"\n\nGood joined a growing number of Republicans in Congress who have spoken out against Greene's efforts in recent days, including some of the most conservative members of Congress. Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee told CNN last week he believes the effort to oust Johnson is a \"distraction\" and \"mistake.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Greene's office for comment via email.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus last year voted to remove Greene from the group, which is comprised of Congress' most conservative Republicans over her personal attacks against some of the group's members, former Representative Ken Buck previously told NBC News.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Greene said she doesn't \"give a rat's a**\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" the congresswoman said last week during a news conference.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Greene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has continued to scrutinize Johnson over his support for the bipartisan spending bill that includes $60.8 billion of aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. Meanwhile, Johnson has continued to face mounting criticism from House conservatives as he pushed forward the bill, which passed House legislation late last month.\n\nSince Greene's announcement, several Republicans have criticized the congresswoman.\n\nCruz rebuked Greene's plans on Saturday as he told The Hill, \"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also criticized Greene on CNN late last month, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Greene has previously fired back at her critics as she said that she doesn't \"give a rat's a**\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" the congresswoman said Wednesday at a news conference announcing her plans to hold a vote.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Cruz and Greene's office via email for additional comment.\n\nSo far, only two other Republicans have come out in support of Greene, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\n\nMeanwhile, the House Democratic leadership has also said it is against the vote.\n\nIf a vote is held on the motion to vacate, Johnson may need to turn to Democrats to save his speakership due to the GOP's slim 4-seat majority. Due to other vacancies, this would leave Johnson with room for only one Republican detractor, barring any Democratic support.\n\nIn addition, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Matt Gaetz, both Florida Republicans, have warned that Greene's efforts could also lead to the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\n\nDuring an interview on Rumble with Gaetz last month, Luna reiterated her criticisms of Johnson, but warned against the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\n\n\"The Uniparty has prioritized foreign interests again and placed America last. Speaker Johnson has gone back on most of what he said when we elected him to be Speaker, rendering him almost unrecognizable as a legislator and the leader we chose. That being said, the possibility of a Democratic-controlled House poses a greater risk. We stand as the last barrier that has stopped Biden from completely ruining our country. Given our historically narrow majority, we must not allow the gavel to pass to the Democrats,\" Luna previously told Newsweek.\n\nMeanwhile, in response to the recent calls for Johnson to vacate, the House speaker warned about what a motion to vacate would mean for Congress during a press conference last month.\n\n\"I don't think that would be helpful to us from a political standpoint for the Republican Party to continue to govern, maintain and keep our majority in November. I think that would have been a great hindrance to it. And so, that wouldn't be helpful. Nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard, either. It would be chaos in the House,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_venegas@newsweek.com", "name": "Natalie Venegas",

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, effectively ensuring Johnson won't lose his job.\n\nA failed vote will give Johnson an opportunity to argue that it is time to move on from the issue. But support from Democrats will open Johnson up to even more criticism from his right flank.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many Republicans will vote against Johnson - the higher the number, the more of a blow it could prove to be to the speaker's standing within the House GOP conference.\n\nGreene has said she will force a vote in the coming days, escalating pressure on Johnson and setting up a major showdown on the House floor. Even if the vote fails, as expected, it still threatens to intensify divisions among House Republicans, who control a razor-thin majority.\n\nMany Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson and do not want to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.\n\nGreene and other hardline conservatives, however, have been highly critical of Johnson's speakership. Conservative anger at Johnson intensified after he worked to help pass a major foreign aid package with assistance for Ukraine last month.\n\nJohnson has defended his leadership against the threat, saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" the speaker said in a statement after Greene announced she would move forward with a vote.\n\nTwo other Republicans are publicly supporting Greene's motion to vacate: GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\n\n\"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job - our job is to vote,\" Greene said at a news conference where she announced she would trigger a vote.\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" the congresswoman said, \"that's a list of names - and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\nGreene has been dangling the threat of an ouster vote for weeks. She originally filed the motion to oust Johnson in March amid conservative anger over his handling of the government funding fight.\n\nThe congresswoman also has not ruled out the possibility of forcing repeated votes in the future after the coming vote.\n\n\"I haven't made a decision on that yet,\" she said at the news conference.\n\nA floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed, but a motion to table - or kill - the resolution is expected to be offered and voted on first.\n\nHouse GOP leaders plan to quickly take up and kill Greene's motion, according to GOP sources. Depending on attendance, they could vote the same day she offers it.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass the foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table if the issue arose.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not commit last week to having Democrats save Johnson from multiple attempts to oust him if conservatives trigger repeated votes in the future.\n\nJeffries said the Democratic caucus \"will take it one step at a time.\"\n\nFor more CNN news

Badge of honor,\" Ms. Greene said on X. \"Don't threaten me with a good time.\"\n\nMs. Greene also tweeted Monday that the minority leader, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, is the true speaker of the House and criticized Mr. Johnson, again, for presiding over a \"uniparty.\"\n\nSo far, Mr. Johnson has dismissed Ms. Greene's threat, telling CNN's \"The Laura Coates Show\" last week, \"I don't think too much about the motion to vacate.\"\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"These are very serious times that we're living in, and the American people need and deserve a functioning Congress, and I think that is the prevailing factor here.\"\n\nMs. Greene's effort, which is centered on Mr. Johnson bringing aid to Ukraine to a vote -- which required Democratic approval to pass due to the GOP's razor-thin majority and stubborn opposition to the aid package from a small number conservative House members -- has stirred increased criticism of the congresswoman from her fellow Republicans.\n\nRepublicans like Congressman Vern Buchanan have highlighted their desire not to oust Mr. Johnson ahead of the election, with Mr. Buchanan telling the Associated Press that voters \"don't want another 30 days of a dysfunctional Congress.\"\n\n\"It's huge, it's huge, especially for the presidential election but all of us up and down the ballot,\" Mr. Buchanan said.\n\nOthers, like the House majority leader, Steve Scalise, have moved to talk Ms. Greene out of bringing the motion to vacate against Mr. Johnson, albeit without much apparent success.\n\nSo far, just two other Republicans, Congressmen Thomas Massie and Paul Gosar, have expressed support for ousting Mr. Johnson in the near future. \"This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker,\" Mr. Massie said in a post. \"If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year, you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"},

Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, says Mr. Johnson deserves to be removed because he has partnered with Democrats on key legislative priorities, including major spending legislation, a massive foreign-aid package and the reauthorization of a warrantless government surveillance tool.\n\nWhile at most only a handful of Republicans are likely to back Ms. Greene's vote to push out Mr. Johnson, the GOP's razor-thin majority means some Democrats would be needed to block the Republican coup.\n\nThe top three Democratic leaders announced they will vote to save Mr. Johnson, but such a vote would be politically risky for both parties.\n\nMr. Johnson told The Times that Ms. Greene's threat to bring up the motion is \"a recipe for chaos,\" and that lawmakers in the GOP conference \"don't want to engage in that right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_ferrechio@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Susan Ferrechio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/05/01/Congress_Speaker_83460_c0-251-6000-3749_s1770x1032.jpg?21cd7831eab7ad0be624c464dc808fe93f3b603e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene is set to force a vote on a bid to depose the speaker in the coming days. The motion is poised to be defeated with Democrat help.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will face a vote to strip him of the gavel in the coming days. While he's expected to survive the ouster bid, the move presents another test for the Republican leader as he presides over a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber.\n\nHouse Democrat leaders said they would vote to shelve a motion to vacate advanced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), effectively ensuring its defeat on the House floor.\n\nWhile Mr. Johnson could claim a victory from this scenario, he may also face further scrutiny from the right flank for having to rely on Democrats to save his speakership.\n\nMs. Greene, who is publicly supported by two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), first offered the motion to vacate in March to serve as a \"warning\" after the speaker advanced a $1.2 trillion government funding bill with broad Democrat support.\n\nSince then, Mr. Johnson's vote against adding a warrant requirement to a bill reauthorizing controversial surveillance powers and his take up of a $95 billion foreign aid bill funding Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific that didn't include border security measures stirred outrage among some conservatives, including Ms. Greene.\n\n\"I think she's gone about this in a very reasonable way. She's given the speaker multiple chances to resign, to leave. And instead, he's clinging to power by clinging to Democrats,\" he said.\n\nUndaunted that Democrats are poised to protect Mr. Johnson by voting to table her motion, Ms. Greene said, \"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job -- our job is to vote.\"\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" she said, \"that's a list of names -- and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" the speaker said in a statement on May 1.\n\nRep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) said he thought the procedure was being used improperly. \"I don't think you enact a motion to vacate in the manner that it's [being] done; it's as serious as impeachment. There should be at least some standards, moral standards, such as if someone were to engage in an unethical action, or crime,\" he said.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" they said in an April 30 statement.\n\nHouse Democrats were told to vote their conscience on the issue. Many were on board with the plan to protect the Republican speaker.\n\n\"I'm definitely open towards making sure that speaker Johnson continues,\" Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) said.\n\nRep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) went a bit further. \"I think there will be Democrats who would rather reward a speaker for doing the right thing than reward Marjorie Taylor Greene, and her effort to overtake the House,\" he said.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) expressed reservations about killing the motion to vacate: \"Now is certainly not the time to vacate the speaker's chair,\" he said. The Georgia representative said he was troubled by some of Mr. Johnson's viewpoints, saying they were almost enough to disqualify him as Speaker of the House.\n\n\"But he is our speaker,\" he said, \"And he has acted responsibly by bringing the supplemental appropriations bill to the floor of the House at personal peril.\"\n\nRep. Annie Kuster (D-Pa.), in voicing her support for tabling the motion to vacate, criticized Ms. Greene, who is known for unapologetically speaking her mind. \"She's been a thorn in our side for a long time; now she's a thorn in [the GOP's] side,\" Ms. Kuster said. \"So, I'm thrilled to take the position that she is a paper tiger, she doesn't speak for anyone, she can't count, and she doesn't have the votes.\"\n\nBut other Democrats were wary of bailing out Mr. Johnson.\n\n\"If you're asking me, 'Do I believe Democrats should help Mike Johnson?' I do not ... he is very right-wing. I don't know why I'd support that,\" said Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.)\n\n\"Frankly, if he stays in office at the sufferance of Democrats, he's a marked man in his own party,\" he added.\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) spoke even more firmly: \"Mike Johnson is absolutely against everything that I believe in,\" she said. \"There is no way I would vote for someone like him to be able to stay in his seat. Let the Republicans, and maybe others do that, but that won't be me.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Greene brings the motion to the floor, leadership will be required to hold a vote on it within a few days. Normally, a motion to vacate requires a simple majority to pass, but in this case, a member is expected to bring up a motion to table the measure. This is likely to succeed, which would put off a formal vote on the issue altogether.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [],

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican, does not.\n\nConservatives who believe she does are sleepwalking through their civic life and enabling America's leftward drift. So, to be blunt, it is time for those conservatives to wake up! Republicans need to come back to the concerns of real Americans. What matters is not the move to vacate, in congressional parlance. What matters is the price of the weekly grocery bill.\n\nThe Republican Party that I love and have spent my life working on behalf of, is in danger of being viewed by a significant number of flag-loving Americans as a bunch of spoiled immature brats who would rather argue among themselves than defeat their real opponents in political and policy debate.\n\nRecently, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has won elections in a purple state, said that Greene \"is dragging our brand down.\" Tillis went on to call Greene \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\" U.S. Representative Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican who represents a swing district, said that Greene's political theater must \"come to an end.\"\n\nThere is a prerequisite to making public policy. It is called winning elections. In today's America, winning elections does not start in the House Republican caucus. In fact, in a large part of America, winning elections ends there. The constant bickering, the infighting, the votes against moving legislation to the next level of the legislative process are self-defeating exercises that a huge majority of real Americans do not understand and care about even less. Now, Greene threatens to throw onto the political wreckage another grenade in the form of a vote to remove the conservative Republican Speaker of the House.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene may be a clickbait leader in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building. However, she and her ilk are totally irrelevant in the produce and meat aisles of the Safeways, Wegmans, Giants, Publixes and Albertsons across the American heartland.\n\nThere is a peace-and-quiet vote out there, and the Chaos Caucus, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, is driving it away from all Republicans, up and down the ballot.\n\nGoverning is about solving problems for hard-working American families. Until Republicans seize control of their messaging from Marjorie Taylor Greene and her amigos, including U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, my beloved conservative Republican philosophy will remain a minority view subject to self-inflicted ridicule by much of America. The Republican Party, and the conservative movement, will be better off when MTG comes to mean \"Marginalizing Taylor Greene.\"\n\n___\n\nKevin Igoe is the former deputy chief of staff of the Republican National Committee and former executive director of the Maryland Republican Party.

U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican, does not.\n\nConservatives who believe she does are sleepwalking through their civic life and enabling America's leftward drift. So, to be blunt, it is time for those conservatives to wake up. Republicans need to come back to the concerns of real Americans. What matters is not the move to vacate, in congressional parlance. What matters is the price of the weekly grocery bill.\n\nThe Republican Party that I love and have spent my life working on behalf of is in danger of being viewed by a significant number of flag-loving Americans as a bunch of spoiled immature brats who would rather argue among themselves than defeat their real opponents.\n\nRecently, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has won elections in a purple state, said that Greene \"is dragging our brand down.\" Tillis went on to call Greene \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\" U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican who represents a swing district, said that Greene's political theater must \"come to an end.\"\n\nThere is a prerequisite to making public policy. It is called winning elections. In today's America, winning elections does not start in the House Republican caucus. In fact, in a large part of America, winning elections ends there. The constant bickering, the infighting, the votes against moving legislation to the next level of the legislative process are self-defeating exercises that a huge majority of real Americans do not understand.\n\nNow Greene threatens to throw onto the political wreckage another grenade in the form of a vote to remove the conservative Republican Speaker of the House.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene may be a clickbait leader in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building. However, she and her ilk are totally irrelevant in the produce and meat aisles of the Safeways, Wegmans, Giants, Publixes and Albertsons across the American heartland.\n\nThere is a peace-and-quiet vote out there, and the Chaos Caucus, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, is driving it away from all Republicans, up and down the ballot.\n\nGoverning is about solving problems for hard-working American families. Until Republicans seize control of their messaging from Marjorie Taylor Greene and her amigos, including U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, my beloved conservative Republican philosophy will remain a minority view subject to self-inflicted ridicule by much of America.

Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) speaks to the press after meeting with President Joe Biden and other Congressional leaders at the White House in Washington on Feb. 27, 2024. (Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times)\n\nWith the Republican majority dwindling, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has said that the House GOP's \"chaos\" and \"dysfunction\" has \"effectively\" given Democrats the majority.\n\nMr. Jeffries made the comments during a May 6 interview with Norah O'Donnell for CBS's \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nDuring the exchange, Mr. Jeffries contended that the Democrats have direct control of the House due to the disintegration of the Republican majority.\n\n\"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done,\" Mr. Jeffries said. \"Those are just the facts.\"\n\n\"It's a difficult situation on the other side of the aisle because many of my Republican colleagues are more interested in creating chaos, dysfunction, and extremism,\" he continued.\n\nWith just five Republicans making up the House majority, if all are present, meaning that the Republican majority can only afford to lose one vote to the Democrat side, meaning that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has little room to pass contentious legislation without involving Democrats.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has criticized Mr. Johnson for forming a \"uni party\" by collaborating with Democrats and threatened to remove the speaker from office.\n\nDemocrats and Mr. Jeffries have pledged to defend Mr. Johnson in the face of Ms. Greene's request to vacate.\n\nMr. Johnson will likely face the vote to take his gavel within a few days.\n\nHowever, House Democrat leadership announced on April 30 that they would vote to save Mr. Johnson, should Mr. Greene activate her motion to vacate.\n\nThe Democrat lawmakers said they would vote to table Ms. Greene's motion to vacate should she bring it up.\n\nThey cited the House GOP leader's recent help in passing $95 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific that had been stalled for months.\n\n\"If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" Mr. Jeffries, Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Conn.) and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) said in a joint statement.\n\nIn March, in response to Mr. Johnson's initiative to secure broad Democrat support for $1.2 trillion in government financing, Ms. Greene presented a motion to vacate that she characterized as a \"warning\" or \"a pink slip.\"\n\nSince then, two other Republicans have publicly backed the motion: Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).\n\nDespite conservative outrage over last week's passage of a foreign aid package that included more than $60 billion for Ukraine, most in the Republican conference have not supported Ms. Greene's effort.\n\nUndeterred by the speakership's backing, Ms. Greene appears ready to move forward, telling reporters: \"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job -- our job is to vote.\"\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" she said, \"that's a list of names -- and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\nIn his reply, Mr. Johnson characterized Ms. Greene's declaration as a \"dangerous gambit\" that had the potential to disrupt Congress' function.\n\nThe speaker said in a statement on May 1, \"This motion is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nRank and file Democrats are reportedly divided, being told by their leadership to vote their conscience on the issue.\n\nRep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters he was hesitant to support the Republican speaker, saying: \"If you're asking me, 'Do I believe Democrats should help Mike Johnson?' I do not ... he is very right-wing. I don't know why I'd support that.\n\n\"Frankly, if he stays in office at the sufferance of Democrats, he's a marked man in his own party,\" he added.\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) spoke even more harshly about the issue, saying: \"Mike Johnson is absolutely against everything that I believe in.\n\n\"There is no way I would vote for someone like him to be able to stay in his seat.\n\n\"Let the Republicans, and maybe others do that, but that won't be me.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Marjorie Taylor Greene has unveiled a special hat she had made specifically for congressional Republicans and Democrats who are beholden to Ukraine.\n\nUnveiled on Wednesday, the hat looks like any other ol' cap, except it says \"MUGA\" on it in imitation of \"MAGA,\" which stands for Make America Great Again. \"MUGA\" meanwhile means Make Ukraine Great Again.\n\n\"That's what this is -- the uniparty is Make Ukraine Great Again,\" she said in the clip. \"The uniparty is all about funding every single foreign war. They think this is the business model that needs to be done.\"\n\nShe then placed the hat on a poster of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democrat House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nAll this happened during a press conference the congresswoman held with Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nThe purpose of the presser was to announce that she intends to trigger a vote next week on a motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\n\"This vote will be called next week and I just want to urge all our colleagues to prepare for it,\" she said. \"It's the right thing to do for America. It's time to clean house and get our conference in order and get ready to support President Trump's agenda, God willing he wins in November.\"\n\nGreene also slammed congressional Democrats for deciding, after Johnson successfully recently passed a gigantic foreign aid spending bill, to back his speakership.\n\n\"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again, having supported a Republican speaker, a Christian conservative,\" she said. \"I think that'll play well. I'm excited about it.\"\n\n\"I also can't wait to see my Republican Conference show their cards and show who we are because voters deserve it. Have the Republican Party finally learned their lesson, have they finally heard the message from voters back at home?\" she added.\n\nMassie for his part argued that Johnson and Jeffries should be \"archrivals,\" not allies working together to fund foreign wars.\n\n\"This is about who holds that gavel,\" he said. \"Right now, they are both holding that gavel. They are sharing power about procedures, about what bills will come to the floor, about how long we will debate those bills and which committees are comprised of which members.\"\n\nAs for Greene and Massie's GOP colleagues, they don't seem to care too much for the stunts.\n\n\"GOP Representative Dan Bacon told CNN's Manu Raju that '98 percent of' House Republicans consider Greene's move to be 'disgusting,' while Congressman Derrick Van Orden said that the attempt to remove Johnson reminded him of tactics from 'a junior high school' or a 'reality television show,'\" according to Newsweek.\n\nConversely, Greene doesn't appear to care what they think.\n\n\"What you guys need to know is I really don't give a rat's ass what anybody up here says about what I'm doing,\" she told CNN's Manu Raju while standing on the steps of the Capitol late Wednesday.\n\nListen:\n\nTheir Democrat colleagues are reportedly also maneuvering against them.\n\n\"Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement that they would not support Greene's motion, while vowing to 'aggressively' push back 'against MAGA extremism' and 'turn the page on this chapter of pro-Putin Republican obstruction,'\" Newsweek notes.\n\nAnd then there's Johnson, who earlier this week rudely dismissed Greene's motion as a nothing burger not worth sweating over.\n\nAsked by NewsNation's Blake Burman whether Greene is a serious lawmaker, he replied, \"Bless her heart, I don't think she's proving to be.\"\n\nMeanwhile, leftists have taken to trolling Greene by producing their own version of the MUGA hat and selling it to their Ukraine-loving groupies.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is set to boil over this week when the Georgia Republican moves to force a vote on the GOP leader's ouster -- which is all but certain to fail.\n\nGreene -- who filed a motion to vacate against Johnson in March -- is vowing to force a vote on her removal resolution this week, a long-time-coming for the GOP rabble-rouser who has dangled the ouster mechanism over the Speaker's head while sharply criticizing his legislative decisions at every turn.\n\nHer gambit, however, is poised to fall flat: A large number of conservative Republicans have said they plan to oppose her effort -- only two are supporting it -- and the top three House Democrats said they will vote to table Greene's ouster effort. The Georgia Republican, nonetheless, is vowing to plow ahead.\n\n\"Mike Johnson must resign or be removed,\" she wrote Friday on the social platform X.\n\nAlso this week, the Senate is poised to continue consideration of a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. A short-term extension, however, may be necessary as lawmakers race the clock to meet Friday's deadline.\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to appear alongside Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) at the Capitol for an event honoring individuals killed in the Holocaust. And the House is set to consider a bill that would add a citizenship question to the bicentennial census.\n\nGreene vows movement on Johnson ouster gambit\n\nGreene is vowing to plow ahead with her crusade to oust Johnson this week, an effort that has failed to gain traction in the GOP ranks and among former President Trump, and one that has faced opposition among Democrats -- dynamics that are all but ensuring the push will fail in an embarrassing fashion on the House floor.\n\nThose facts have been apparent for days -- conservatives have been voicing skepticism of Greene's gambit for weeks, and Democratic leadership last week said it would vote to table the Georgia Republican's ouster measure if it hit the floor for a vote.\n\nBut Greene and her two co-sponsors -- Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) -- are, nonetheless, moving forward with the effort, seeking to put Republicans on the record about whether or not they support Johnson.\n\n\"This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker,\" Massie wrote Sunday on X. \"If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year, you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson. #uniparty.\"\n\nGreene and Massie announced last week that they would move to force a vote on their resolution this week, though it remains unclear which day they will pull the trigger. The House returns to session Monday.\n\nOnce the Republicans move to force a vote on their resolution, House GOP leadership has two legislative days to move on the legislation. Leadership is expected to stage a vote on a motion to table the measure, which will be successful with support from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has brushed off the looming threat to his gavel, characterizing it as an ill-advised move for the GOP -- and entire country.\n\n\"I don't think too much about the motion to vacate,\" he said on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday. \"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country. These are very serious times that we're living in, and the American people need and deserve a functioning Congress, and I think that is the prevailing factor here.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to Greene's imminent move, conservatives have amped up their criticism of Greene.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing,\" Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), the chair of the House Freedom Caucus who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in October, said on NewsNation's \"The Hill Sunday\" in an interview. \"She doesn't lead anyone.\"\n\nThe ouster threat comes against the backdrop of November's elections, which are less than six months away. Republicans of all stripes have urged GOP lawmakers to remain united in the lead-up to those contests, a message that the head of the Republican National Committee (RNC) re-upped as Greene promises to pursue her ouster effort.\n\n\"We need to flip the Senate, and we need to expand our majority in the House. We're not going to do that if we're not unified,\" RNC Chair Michael Whatley told NBC News in an interview. \"We need to make sure that all of the Republicans understand the gravity of this election cycle, and they do, and we need to make sure that we are on the same page as we're moving forward.\"\n\nSenate stares down FAA reauthorization deadline\n\nThe Senate is continuing consideration of a bill to reauthorize the FAA for five years this week, though a short-term extension may be needed as Congress stares down a Friday deadline.\n\nSenate GOP Whip John Thune (S.D.) told reporters last week that a short-term extension may be necessary to avoid a lapse in the authority and wrap up the process for the full reauthorization bill, citing the large number of amendments senators have requested votes on and the short window for votes. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene Tuesday, leaving just four days until Friday's deadline.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Thune said when asked about the prospect of a short-term extension. \"May 10 is just around the corner. ... My assumption is that if we're gonna not have a lapse in the authority, they'll probably need to be a short-term extension.\"\n\nHe did not say how long that extension would last.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (Texas) -- the top Republican on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee -- however, said last week that he thinks the upper chamber can get the bill over the finish line with enough time to spare.\n\n\"I don't think that will prove necessary,\" he said of a short-term extension. \"I think we'll get it done next week.\"\n\nThe FAA bill cleared its first procedural hurdle in the Senate last week in an 89-10 vote. Senators, however, are trying to add some unrelated priorities into the legislation since it is the final must-pass measure Congress has to consider before the fall, a reality that is slowing down the consideration process.\n\nOne related priority that is likely to get a vote is an amendment that would nix language in the legislation adding five slots, or 10 flights, at Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nSenators who represent Virginia and Maryland have pushed for the amendment, arguing that National Airport already sees plenty of traffic, while lawmakers from states further from Washington, D.C., have advocated for the additional flights, claiming it would increase convenience for travelers.\n\nBiden, House leaders to appear for Holocaust remembrance event\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill this week for a Holocaust remembrance event, appearing alongside Holocaust survivors, Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).\n\nThe event -- formally called the Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony -- is scheduled for Tuesday at 11 a.m. Biden and Johnson are both scheduled to deliver remarks.\n\nDays of Remembrance is the U.S.'s annual commemoration to honor the 6 million Jewish men, women and children who were killed in the Holocaust. The event in the Capitol \"honors the American troops who fought to defeat Nazism and recognizes the U.S. Army divisions that liberated concentration camps,\" according to an advisory from Johnson's office.\n\nThe gathering comes amid a wave of pro-Palestinian protests taking place on college campuses across the country, which have cropped up as the Israel-Hamas war continues in the Middle East. Some lawmakers have accused the demonstrations of taking an antisemitic turn.\n\nIn December, the Anti-Defamation League said that more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents had been reported in the U.S. since Oct. 7 -- the day Hamas launched its attack on Israel -- which marked a 337 percent increase year-over-year.\n\nLast week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will \"discuss our moral duty to combat the rising scourge of antisemitism and the Biden-Harris administration's work to implementing the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism to make real the promise of never, never again.\"\n\nHouse to consider bill on census citizenship question\n\nThe House this week is slated to vote on a bill that calls for adding a citizenship question to the decennial census.\n\nThe legislation -- titled the Equal Representation Act -- would direct the Census Bureau to add a question to the 10-year survey that asks for the respondent's citizenship status, and require that the U.S. only consider citizens when determining the number of congressional seats each state receives.\n\nThe citizenship question did not appear on the 2020 census. The Trump administration had pushed for the question to be added to the decennial survey before dropping the effort in July 2019 after the Supreme Court blocked the idea.\n\nThe House Oversight and Accountability Committee advanced the legislation in a party-line 22-20 vote in April.\n\n\"The Equal Representation Act will make sure that American citizens - and American citizens only - are given fair and equal representation in their federal government,\" Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), the sponsor of the bill, said in a statement in January, when he announced its introduction.\n\nAl Weaver contributed.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and other far-right Republicans next week, but the goal isn't to elect a new speaker. At least not this time around.\n\nThe goal is to move today's GOP even further to the right, they indicate, and Johnson's the perfect prop for this latest political ploy.\n\nWhile most Republicans oppose Greene's plan to formally call for a vote on her motion to vacate Johnson's - the same tool used last autumn to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy - she doesn't care what her fellow Republicans are saying.\n\n\"They didn't vote for me,\" Greene told Raw Story on the Capitol steps Wednesday.\n\nNOW READ: Trump in trouble: Why ex-presidents typically implode on their comeback tours\n\n\"But who is your base?\" Raw Story asked. \"Is your base Steve Bannon's War Room? Or is it Georgia folks?\"\n\n\"My district is great,\" Greene said. \"I think you should talk to my comms director right here, and he'll tell you about all the support I have.\"\n\nGreene then went in to vote on the House floor, as her communications team sent Raw Story the last three Economist / YouGov polls showing Johnson's favorability rating going from \"50% then down to 47% and then plummets to 41% with [Donald] Trump voters.\"\n\nOnly 22% of respondents to those Economist / YouGov polls have a favorable view of Greene, but 47% of Trump supporters view her favorably.\n\nWhile Johnson has been losing support from Trump's base since ushering a foreign aid package -- heavy on Ukraine spending -- through the House, Greene hasn't seen her numbers budge.\n\n\"MTG stays steady,\" Greene's communications team noted to Raw Story.\n\nGreene may be lonely in her effort to challenge Johnson, but she's not completely alone.\n\nReps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) are the two other Republicans to publicly endorse the motion to vacate.\n\n\"It's our cause,\" Massie told Raw Story from the U.S. Capitol. \"I couldn't think of a better person to work with on something of this magnitude than Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"\n\nThe Greene-Massie-Gosar axis expects more restive Republicans to join them next week, especially after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and other Democratic leaders announced their plan to come up with the votes to table Greene's motion to vacate, thereby freezing the motion and saving Johnson's speakership.\n\n\"He has passed everything the Democrats' wish list, and now has the endorsement of Hakeem Jeffries,\" Greene tweeted on X. \"I will be calling for a vote to vacate the chair next week, so the American people can see who stands with the Uniparty and who stands with the people.\"\n\nThe threat is barely veiled from Greene, who with Gosar and Massie feel betrayed by Johnson, beholden to Trump's base and empowered by House rules that allow any one member to challenge the speaker.\n\n\"It's basically 'Lord of the Flies',\" said Massie, referring to the classic book where a group of stranded children attempt to govern themselves on an adult-free island. \"Where McCarthy had some ability to say, 'Hey, don't do that,' Johnson does not. He's like the substitute teacher that nobody takes seriously.\"\n\nThe Ukraine aid package -- which Greene summed up to reporters as, \"Make Ukraine Great Again\" -- revealed the fault lines dividing GOP hawks from the party's MAGA/isolationist wing.\n\n\"There is a big realignment right now. I call it a cold civil war in the party, and it's gone hot and Johnson's picked a side of the appropriators and the 'Uniparty' and the military industrial complex, which isn't what he led on to be when he got elected speaker,\" Massie said. \"But he's picked a side in this.\"\n\nGreene, Gosar and Massie know their motion to vacate is likely to fail, but they're betting it will empower them by weakening Johnson.\n\n\"I think there'll be enough votes to show that Mike Johnson is a lame duck,\" Massie said. \"He doesn't know that, and so next week, I think, he's gonna have to come to terms with, 'Well, when I come back next Congress I'm not going to be the speaker. Should I stay in this spot now that the world knows it? Am I depriving our party of a general who can go out there and lead the majority?'\"\n\nAnd they're fine if Johnson's publicly humiliated in the process.\n\n\"One of the goals is to show that he is not viable next Congress, because he would be terrible. He would be worse than Paul Ryan,\" Massie said, referring to the House speaker who stepped down in early 2019 after deciding not to seek reelection.\n\nWhile Johnson's expected to keep his gavel next week, Greene and others on the far-right are hoping the vote will expand their ranks of rabble-rousing Republicans set on upending Washington and the GOP of yesterday.\n\n\"It's gonna be a list of people that are the problem and people who aren't,\" Massie told Raw Story. \"Or, who are trying not to be the problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has criticized Mr. Johnson for forming a \"uni party\" by collaborating with Democrats and threatened to remove the speaker from office.\n\nDemocrats and Mr. Jeffries have pledged to defend Mr. Johnson in the face of Ms. Greene's request to vacate.\n\nMr. Johnson will likely face the vote to take his gavel within a few days.\n\nHowever, House Democrat leadership announced on April 30 that they would vote to save Mr. Johnson, should Mr. Greene activate her motion to vacate.\n\nThe Democrat lawmakers said they would vote to table Ms. Greene's motion to vacate should she bring it up.\n\nThey cited the House GOP leader's recent help in passing $95 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific that had been stalled for months.\n\n\"If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" Mr. Jeffries, Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Conn.) and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) said in a joint statement.\n\nIn March, in response to Mr. Johnson's initiative to secure broad Democrat support for $1.2 trillion in government financing, Ms. Greene presented a motion to vacate that she characterized as a \"warning\" or \"a pink slip.\"\n\nSince then, two other Republicans have publicly backed the motion: Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).\n\nUndeterred by the speakership's backing, Ms. Greene appears ready to move forward, telling reporters: \"I believe in recorded votes. That is our job -- our job is to vote.\"\n\n\"If this vote fails,\" she said, \"that's a list of names -- and the voters and the American people ... they deserve that list.\"\n\nThe speaker said in a statement on May 1, \"This motion is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nRank and file Democrats are reportedly divided, being told by their leadership to vote their conscience on the issue.\n\nRep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters he was hesitant to support the Republican speaker, saying: \"If you're asking me, 'Do I believe Democrats should help Mike Johnson?' I do not ... he is very right-wing. I don't know why I'd support that.\n\n\"Frankly, if he stays in office at the sufferance of Democrats, he's a marked man in his own party,\" he added.\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) spoke even more harshly about the issue, saying: \"Mike Johnson is absolutely against everything that I believe in.\n\n\"There is no way I would vote for someone like him to be able to stay in his seat.\n\n\"Let the Republicans, and maybe others do that, but that won't be me.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "60 Minutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katherine Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delia Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Aguilar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Aguilar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Connolly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerry Connolly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/02/27/id5596337-02272024-DSC05689-Hakeem-Jeffries-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 232, "textEnd": 237}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1564, "textEnd": 1572}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 2798, "textEnd": 2803}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Don't threaten me with a good time.\"\n\nHer Monday morning missive may have come in response to reporting from Punchbowl News indicating that Johnson is open to kicking Republicans off of their committees if they vote against certain procedural votes that usually pass on party lines -- something that hard-right members of the conference have increasingly done in the last 16 months in order to protest party leadership.\n\nA person familiar with Johnson's remarks told Business Insider that they were hypothetical and referred to changes that House Republicans may make under the next Congress, rather than in the immediate future.\n\nAdditionally, Johnson can't remove Greene or any other member -- or change the rules of the House -- unilaterally and would need to hold a House-wide vote on the matter.\n\nBut the Georgia congressman's comments illustrate the degree to which she's returned to her roots as an outside agitator, rather than a sober-minded legislator.\n\nGreene was barred from serving on committees by House Democrats at the beginning of her first term, owing to her past espousal of violent rhetoric and conspiracy theories, only for Republicans to place her on committees when they took over.\n\nGreene is poised to force a vote on ousting Johnson this week -- though it's almost certain to fail, given House Democratic leaders' vow to protect him from Greene's effort.\n\nJust two other Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona -- have signed onto Greene's motion to vacate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and two other hard-liners furious with Johnson's bipartisan dealmaking, is likely to fail, ensuring the Speaker will keep hold of the gavel heading into November's elections.\n\nBut the vote is expected to break down in highly unusual ways, splitting both parties along strange lines that will produce odd alliances between ideological foes and see some of Johnson's most ardent critics rushing to ensure he remains in power.\n\nHere are the five groups to watch as the House decides the Speaker's fate.\n\nGOP critics ready to boot him\n\nGreene is marching into this week's vote with an army of two -- Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) -- a small force that is poised to flounder amid bipartisan opposition to the motion to vacate.\n\nThe trio has strongly criticized Johnson for his propensity to cut legislative deals with Democrats, an anger that cropped up after the Speaker spearheaded a sprawling funding package, came to a boil when he supported a bill to reauthorize the U.S.'s warrantless surveillance powers, and spilled over after he muscled through a foreign aid package that included billions of dollars for Ukraine.\n\nOther hard-liners, to be sure, have expressed frustration with Johnson's track record, but have stopped short of joining Greene's effort. That, however, could change when the vote begins next week.\n\n\"I really don't have a number yet,\" Greene told reporters when asked how many Republicans will side with her. \"But this is the recorded vote that America needs to see.\"\n\nBut with the writing on the wall, proponents of the motion are trying to manage expectations, arguing that even if Johnson retains the gavel this time, the vote will show that he does not have a long-term future in the top job.\n\n\"I'll go out on a limb and predict there'll be enough votes to show that Mike Johnson can't be elected Speaker in January,\" Massie said. \"Because although he can get Democrat votes on a motion to table, it's not a motion to table vote in January 3rd, and hopefully when Mike Johnson sees that vote he'll know that he's a lame duck Speaker.\"\n\nGOP critics who want him to stay\n\nFrustration with Johnson is running high in the House GOP conference -- especially among the right flank -- but those feelings will not be fully reflected in this week's vote. A large swath of conservatives say they will oppose the motion to vacate, despite their annoyance, to avoid chaos so close to the November elections.\n\nThose hard-liners, many of whom are members of the House Freedom Caucus, want to maintain a united front -- or as close to one that the conference can mount -- in the lead-up to November to avoid the image of disarray and, in turn, convince voters that they deserve another two years in the majority.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything to be gained by having a motion to vacate the chair at this point in time,\" Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) said.\n\nAnother concern among the right flank is the question of who would replace Johnson if he loses the gavel. With no clear successor in mind, conservatives have said they do not want to install a second-tier candidate who would be the incumbent during leadership elections for the next Congress.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to select someone now that would, in my view, probably [be] the less desirable, not the best option, perhaps, that would be an incumbent going into November,\" said Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), the chair of the Freedom Caucus who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\n\"I think we do the best we can with the Speaker that we have, influence him to the best of our ability, expose what we believe are wrong actions by not just the Speaker but everyone who is voting to support those actions, and have a contest to see who the conference can coalesce around as the best option in November,\" he added.\n\nGOP leadership allies who will back Johnson\n\nThe right's anger toward Johnson has been matched by that of the Speaker's allies toward the center.\n\nThat more moderate group, made up of veteran lawmakers, committee chairs and, more generally, institutionalists who want the government to function smoothly, constitute a vast majority of the GOP conference. And they've lashed out at the hard-liners for much of the year, accusing them of ignoring the reality that no one gets everything they want in a divided Washington.\n\nThose Republicans were up in arms with the rabble-rousing conservatives who toppled McCarthy in October. They've been furious as the hard-liners have adopted the unusual tactic of tanking procedural votes to stall legislation and advance their demands. And they've defended Johnson through his deal-making efforts with President Biden.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) said there's a simple reason Greene is having so much trouble finding GOP support for removing Johnson.\n\n\"Because he's doing a good job,\" Lawler said. \"We've gotten our appropriations bills done; we've gotten FISA through the House; we've gotten the supplemental aid package done.\n\n\"For my colleagues that are upset about not getting border [security],\" he added, \"they should look in the mirror, because they weakened the Speaker's hand to negotiate when they wouldn't pass a rule.\"\n\nSuch frustrations have escalated in recent days, as rank-and-file Republicans -- particularly those, like Lawler, who face tough reelection contests -- are warning against another messy Speaker fight so close to November.\n\n\"Everyone realizes just how detrimental the motion-to-vacate process is, and I don't think it's a popular thing with our base, either,\" Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) said.\n\n\"At this point, so close to an election season, we need to get some spending bills to the floor, start the appropriations process, do no harm, not shoot our quarterback in the head in the fourth quarter, and go win elections.\"\n\nDemocrats shielding Johnson\n\nThe top three House Democrats -- led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) -- announced last week they would vote to table, or dismiss, Greene's vacate resolution, all but ensuring that the ouster effort would fail.\n\nThe move was unprecedented, and it marks a sharp contrast to the Democrats' approach to McCarthy's removal, which they supported unanimously.\n\nThe strategy also gives political cover to those Democrats who had vowed, even months before Greene filed her vacate motion, to protect Johnson from a conservative coup if he brought a short but highly consequential list of legislative priorities to the floor, including bills to prevent a government shutdown and provide more aid to Ukraine.\n\nNow that Johnson has helped usher those bills into law, many Democrats are ready to reward him for what they consider responsible governing.\n\n\"They're trying to boot him out because he did the right thing. And so we ought not to allow that to happen,\" Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) said.\n\nIt's unclear how many Democrats will vote to protect Johnson. But Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), the senior Democrat on the powerful Rules Committee, predicted it would be \"a big chunk\" of the caucus. And leadership -- while not whipping the vote, which they consider a matter of conscience -- are also promoting a desire to stabilize the chamber and prevent Greene from dictating how it's run.\n\n\"She is a legislative arsonist,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chair of the Democratic Caucus. \"And she is holding the gas tank.\"\n\nDemocrats opposing Johnson\n\nDespite the announcement from top Democrats that they will vote to table Greene's resolution, some liberals may stray from the pack and oppose the procedural vote to send a message that, in their eyes, Johnson is not a suitable leader for the Congress and the country.\n\nBefore taking the gavel, the Louisiana Republican had racked up one of the most conservative track records on Capitol Hill. And his positions on abortion, gay rights and the role of religion in government have made him toxic in the eyes of liberals, who don't want to go on record endorsing his leadership.\n\nJohnson, a former constitutional lawyer, also alienated Democrats because he was the architect of the legal reasoning behind the Republican effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and keep Trump in power -- an effort that led to the violent rampage at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWith Johnson's fate hanging in the balance, those postures are top of mind for Democrats.\n\n\"I may vote against it to send the message that Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nThe progressive New Yorker said the Democratic strategy could be two-pronged: provide enough votes to table the resolution, but then let other liberals oppose the gambit to showcase their displeasure with the Speaker.\n\n\"The 'yes' votes provide the functional purpose of what we need,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The 'no' votes allow us to maintain and uphold the message that Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader who seeks to strip abortion rights ... and who also supported overturning the election and setting the stage for Jan. 6.\"\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) offered a similar assessment.\n\n\"He's dangerous, he's an election denier, he's a fundamentalist, and he's not the leadership this country needs,\" Bowman said. \"Hopefully by November, if everyone comes out to vote, we'll be able to recalibrate Congress and begin moving in the right direction for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news",

He also said he is in favor of changing House rules - such as rules on the motion to vacate - at the end of this Congress.\n\nHis remarks come as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) gets ready to trigger a vote this week on her motion to vacate the chair, the same procedural motion which ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) from the speakership in October last year.\n\nGreene announced she would force the vote after what Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) calls Johnson's \"three betrayals.\" Specifically, Johnson ended work being done to pass each of the 12 individual appropriations bills and passed a two-part omnibus bill overwhelmingly supported by Democrats, rammed through a reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) after casting the deciding vote to kill a warrant requirement for spying on Americans, and carried out a scheme to unlock tens of billions in Ukraine aid despite promising not to do so without addressing the border crisis.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) went as far as claiming it is he, not Johnson, controlling the House agenda.\n\nGreene responded to the Punchbowl News report Monday that the problem inside the House Republican Conference lies with Johnson himself.\n\n\"Speaker Mike Johnson is talking about kicking Republican members off of committees if we vote against his rules/bills,\" she remarked on X. \"This comes after he's serving Chuck Schumer and Biden's every single wish and passing major bills with Democrats and not the majority of Republicans!\n\n\"It's not us who is out of line, it's our Republican elected Speaker!!\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson is talking about kicking Republican members off of committees if we vote against his rules/bills.\n\nThis comes after he's serving Chuck Schumer and Biden's every single wish and passing major bills with Democrats and not the majority of Republicans!\n\nIt's not...\n\n-- Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepMTG) May 6, 2024\n\nConservative Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Massie were appointed to the powerful House Rules Committee in January 2023 as part of McCarthy's gavel-winning concessions to conservatives. The shadowy committee, long known as \"the Speaker's committee\" for the outsize influence Speakers exert on it, controls the legislative agenda of the House floor through what are called rules.\n\nVotes on rules in the committee are generally little more than a rubber stamp for the Speaker. But the conservative trio of lawmakers shifted the balance of power in the committee, which consists of nine majority members and four minority members, enabling them to hold up legislation to ensure a speaker considers conservative concerns before ramming legislation through.\n\nJohnson has made history by working with Democrats to send legislation to the floor over the objections of conservatives within his own party.\n\nThe House also must vote to pass rules on the floor before voting on underlying legislation. As on the Rules Committee, it is incredibly rare for the minority party to vote on a rule issued by the majority.\n\nYet Johnson has resorted to passing legislation on the House floor with Democrat rules, effectively forming a coalition government with Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bradley_jaye@breitbart.com",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is set to boil over this week when the Georgia Republican moves to force a vote on the GOP leader's ouster -- which is all but certain to fail.\n\nGreene -- who filed a motion to vacate against Johnson in March -- is vowing to force a vote on her removal resolution this week, a long-time-coming for the GOP rabble rouser who has dangled the ouster mechanism over the Speaker's head while sharply criticizing his legislative decisions at every turn.\n\nHer gambit, however, is poised to fall flat: A large number of conservative Republicans have said they plan to oppose her effort -- only two are supporting it -- and the top three House Democrats said they will vote to table Greene's ouster effort. The Georgia Republican, nonetheless, is vowing to plow ahead.\n\n\"Mike Johnson must resign or be removed,\" she wrote on X on Friday.\n\nAlso this week, the Senate is poised to continue consideration of a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. A short-term extension, however, may be necessary as lawmakers race the clock to meet Friday's deadline.\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to appear alongside Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) at the Capitol for an event honoring individuals killed in the Holocaust. And the House is set to consider a bill that would add a citizenship question to the bicentennial census.\n\nGreene vows movement on Johnson ouster gambit\n\nGreene is vowing to plow ahead with her crusade to oust Johnson this week, an effort that has failed to gain traction in the GOP ranks and among former President Trump, and one that has faced opposition among Democrats -- dynamics that are all but ensuring the push will fail in an embarrassing fashion on the House floor.\n\nThose facts have been apparent for days -- conservatives have been voicing skepticism of Greene's gambit for weeks, and Democratic leadership last week said it would vote to table the Georgia Republican's ouster measure if it hit the floor for a vote.\n\nBut Greene and her two co-sponsors -- Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) -- are, nonetheless, moving forward with the effort, seeking to put Republicans on the record about whether or not they support Johnson.\n\n\"This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker,\" Massie wrote on X Sunday. \"If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year, you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson. #uniparty.\"\n\nGreene and Massie announced last week that they would move to force a vote on their resolution this week, though it remains unclear which day they will pull the trigger. The House returns to session on Monday.\n\nOnce the Republicans move to force a vote on their resolution, House GOP leadership has two legislative days to move on the legislation. Leadership is expected to stage a vote on a motion to table the measure, which will be successful with support from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has brushed off the looming threat to his gavel, characterizing it as an ill-advised move for the GOP -- and entire country.\n\n\"I don't think too much about the motion to vacate,\" he said on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" Friday. \"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party; I think it's wrong for the institution; I think it's wrong for the country. These are very serious times that we're living in, and the American people need and deserve a functioning Congress and I think that is the prevailing factor here.\"\n\nIn the lead up to Greene's imminent move, conservatives have amped up their criticism of Greene.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing,\" Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in October, said on NewsNation's \"The Hill Sunday\" in an interview. \"She doesn't lead anyone.\"\n\nThe ouster threat comes against the backdrop of November's elections, which are less than six months away. Republicans of all stripes have urged GOP lawmakers to remain united in the lead-up to those contests, a message that the head of the Republican National Committee (RNC) re-upped as Greene promises to pursue her ouster effort.\n\n\"We need to flip the Senate, and we need to expand our majority in the House. We're not going to do that if we're not unified,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley told NBC News in an interview. \"We need to make sure that all of the Republicans understand the gravity of this election cycle, and they do, and we need to make sure that we are on the same page as we're moving forward.\"\n\nSenate stares down FAA reauthorization deadline\n\nThe Senate is continuing consideration of a bill to reauthorize the FAA for five years this week, though a short-term extension may be needed as Congress stares down a Friday deadline.\n\nSenate GOP Whip John Thune (S.D.) told reporters last week that a short-term extension may be necessary to avoid a lapse in the authority and wrap up the process for the full reauthorization bill, citing the large number of amendments senators have requested votes on and the short window for votes. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday, leaving just four days until Friday's deadline.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Thune said when asked about the prospect of a short-term extension. \"May 10 is just around the corner... my assumption is that if we're gonna not have a lapse in the authority, they'll probably need to be a short-term extension.\"\n\nHe did not say how long that extension would last.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (Texas) -- the top Republican on the Commerce Committee -- however, said last week that he thinks the upper chamber can get the bill over the finish line with enough time to spare.\n\n\"I don't think that will prove necessary,\" he said of a short-term extension. \"I think we'll get it done next week.\"\n\nThe FAA bill cleared its first procedural hurdle in the Senate last week in an 89-10 vote. Senators, however, are trying to add some unrelated priorities into the legislation since it is the final must-pass measure Congress has to consider before the fall, a reality that is slowing down the consideration process.\n\nOne related priority that is likely to get a vote is an amendment that would nix language in the legislation adding five slots, or 10 flights, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).\n\nSenators who represent Virginia and Maryland have pushed for the amendment, arguing that DCA already sees plenty of traffic, while lawmakers from states further from Washington, D.C., have advocated for the additional flights, claiming that it would increase convenience for travelers.\n\nBiden, House leaders to appear for Holocaust remembrance event\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill this week for a Holocaust remembrance event, appearing alongside Holocaust survivors, Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).\n\nThe event -- formally called the Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony -- is scheduled for Tuesday at 11 am. Biden and Johnson are both scheduled to deliver remarks.\n\nDays of Remembrance is the U.S.'s annual commemoration to honor the six million Jewish men, women and children who were killed in the Holocaust. The event in the Capitol \"honors the American troops who fought to defeat Nazism and recognizes the U.S. Army divisions that liberated concentration camps,\" according to an advisory from Johnson's office.\n\nThe gathering comes amid a wave of pro-Palestinian protests taking place on college campuses across the country, which have cropped up as the Israel-Hamas war continues in the Middle East. Some lawmakers have accused the demonstrations of taking an antisemitic turn.\n\nIn December, Anti-Defamation League said that more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents had been reported in the U.S. since Oct. 7 -- the day Hamas launched its attack on Israel -- which marked a 337 percent increase year-over-year.\n\nLast week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will \"discuss our moral duty to combat the rising scourge of antisemitism and the Biden-Harris administration's work to implementing the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism to make real the promise of never, never again.\"\n\nHouse to consider bill on census citizenship question\n\nThe House this week is slated to vote on a bill that calls for adding a citizenship question to the decennial census.\n\nThe legislation -- titled the Equal Representation Act -- would direct the Census Bureau to add a question to the 10-year survey that asks for the respondent's citizenship status, and require that the U.S. only consider citizens when determining the number of congressional seats each state receives.\n\nThe push comes after the citizenship question did not appear on the 2020 census. The Trump administration had pushed for the question to be added to the decennial survey before dropping the effort in July 2019 after the Supreme Court blocked the idea.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee advanced the legislation in a party-line 22-20 vote in April.\n\n\"The Equal Representation Act will make sure that American citizens - and American citizens only - are given fair and equal representation in their federal government,\" Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), the sponsor of the bill, said in a statement in January, when he announced the introduction of the bill.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican, does not.\n\nConservatives who believe she does are sleepwalking through their civic life and enabling America's leftward drift. So, to be blunt, it is time for those conservatives to wake up! Republicans need to come back to the concerns of real Americans. What matters is not the move to vacate, in congressional parlance. What matters is the price of the weekly grocery bill.\n\nThe Republican Party that I love and have spent my life working on behalf of is in danger of being viewed by a significant number of flag-loving Americans as a bunch of spoiled immature brats who would rather argue among themselves than defeat their real opponents in political and policy debate.\n\nRecently, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has won elections in a purple state, said that Greene \"is dragging our brand down.\" Tillis went on to call Greene \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\" U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican who represents a swing district, said that Greene's political theater must \"come to an end.\"\n\nThere is a prerequisite to making public policy. It is called winning elections. In today's America, winning elections does not start in the House Republican caucus. In fact, in a large part of America, winning elections ends there. The constant bickering, the infighting, the votes against moving legislation to the next level of the legislative process are self-defeating exercises that a huge majority of real Americans do not understand and care about even less. Now, Greene threatens to throw onto the political wreckage another grenade in the form of a vote to remove the conservative Republican Speaker of the House.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene may be a clickbait leader in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building. However, she and her ilk are totally irrelevant in the produce and meat aisles of the Safeways, Wegmans, Giants, Publixes and Albertsons across the American heartland.\n\nThere is a peace-and-quiet vote out there, and the Chaos Caucus, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, is driving it away from all Republicans, up and down the ballot.\n\nGoverning is about solving problems for hardworking American families. Until Republicans seize control of their messaging from Marjorie Taylor Greene and her amigos, including U.S. Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) ignored Donald Trump's endorsement of Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as House speaker and announced plans to try to force him out. One can only assume she is making that attempt for attention, because it seems doomed to fail on the House floor. Democrats have already pledged to support Johnson, and he has backing from much of the Republican caucus.\n\nYou may recall, Greene and the rest of the Freedom Caucus were the reason it took 15 rounds for former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) to get enough votes to win the speakership. The caucus is also why he got fired last October, after less than a year. He resigned from the House at the end of last year.\n\nAnd now Greene -- who infamously blamed secret Jewish space lasers for wildfires and compared mask mandates to the Holocaust -- is making another play for the spotlight. This time it happened to be the same week that the House passed its Antisemitism Awareness Act, an unnecessary bill that at best appears to be doing something. At a moment when pro-Palestinian and humanitarian aid demonstrations are spreading across college campuses, the law would target dangerous speech against Jews ... but the nation already has relevant laws against hate crimes and certain types of speech.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Greene's stunt seems rich, doesn't it? Does the ruling party in the House condemn anti-Jewish hate speech or amplify it? Do Republicans stand for order or chaos?\n\nThe legislation passed 320-91. There were 70 Democrats who voted against it. Greene was among the 21 Republicans who opposed it. Much of the concern from the nays was on defining antisemitism. Some critics feared the measure would infringe on freedom of speech.\n\nWhat does Greene hope to achieve with her nay vote? Or with her campaign to oust Johnson? It's anyone's guess. Two years ago, she spoke at a white nationalist conference, and still she was reelected. Maybe she is exactly what her constituents want. She is very much not what Republican leaders in the House want right now.\n\nFor those House Republicans who don't hang out with white nationalists or say antisemitic things, but who have coddled Greene and the Freedom Caucus, the brewing storm looks a lot like karma. You can't embrace a platform based on anti-intellectualism and half-truths and then get mad when someone does something stupid.\n\nTrumpeting her intention to force Johnson out of the speakership because he worked with Democrats to pass Ukraine aid, Greene said she \"can't wait to see my Republican conference show their cards and show who we are.\" Giving us her best Joan of Arc, she added: \"Are they willing to actually fight? Or are they going to just keep going along to get along?\"\n\nThe challenge Greene represents is not about differences in policy. This is about what's required in a democracy. We are a flawed nation working toward a more perfect union. But we are never going to get there by continuing to allow the most immature among us to get their way. And forcing the House to look for a third House speaker in one term would be incredibly immature.\n\nAnd here's the thing: The rot within the Republican Party does damage far beyond Congress. Members of the Freedom Caucus have behaved like spiteful toddlers since 2015 by obstructing government and as a result have normalized tantrums. Now, as the nation is debating what to do about humanitarian aid in Gaza and the protests on our college campuses, the serious conversations that we need to have are constantly being hijacked by political theater -- including the House's antisemitism bill and the recent parade of hearings to grill college officials.\n\nDomestic politics should not distract us from why so many are protesting. Last month the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution asking for Israel to be investigated and held accountable for possible war crimes. Many of the weapons being used in its war against Hamas are American. Everyone in the U.S. should be concerned about Israel's war and the safety of people in both Gaza and Israel.\n\nMany students I've spoken with are focused on the hostages and civilian casualties. Meanwhile some leaders in Washington are fixated on political theater or trying to micromanage campuses or on toppling the latest speaker of the House. There is chaos on both fronts and regrettably immaturity as well.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I think it's wrong for the institution,\" he said. \"I think it's wrong for the country. Vacating the chair right now would be a dangerous gambit.\"\n\nHe called for there to be a \"functioning Congress.\"\n\nMr. Johnson became speaker on Oct. 25, succeeding former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nMr. McCarthy was ousted on Oct. 3 through a motion to vacate. Eight Republicans joined all Democrats in doing so.\n\nIt was the first time a speaker had been ousted through the vacate motion.\n\nMr. Johnson's remarks came as he appeared safe from losing his position as second in line to the presidency.\n\nThis is thanks to Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), saying that they plan to come to Mr. Johnson's rescue when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (D-Ga.) puts her motion to vacate on the House floor next week.\n\nIn an April 30 statement, Mr. Jeffries, along with House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and House Democrat Conference Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), cited Mr. Johnson putting forth and getting passed a couple weeks ago a $95 billion package that included assistance to Israel, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, and a bill with measures such as banning TikTok.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nHowever, not all Democrats will vote in favor of Mr. Johnson staying as speaker.\n\n\"If you're asking me: 'Do I believe Democrats should help Mike Johnson?' I do not,\" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"Nothing personal. But he's not my candidate. He is very right-wing. I don't know why I'd support that.\"\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), a progressive, concurred.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is absolutely against everything that I believe in,\" she told The Epoch Times. \"There's no way that I would vote for someone like him to be able to stay in his seat.\"\n\nMs. Greene, who filed the motion to vacate in what she said was a warning shot in response to Mr. Johnson getting through Congress in March a $1.2 trillion bill to fund most of the government, announced on May 1 that she would bring her motion next week to oust Mr. Johnson as speaker. This would force a vote within two days.\n\nMs. Greene's motion is supported by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).\n\nHe has \"become a man that none of us recognize,\" according to Ms. Greene, who voted for Mr. Johnson to be speaker.\n\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson, because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,\" she said. \"He voted against funding Ukraine. He was solidly pro-life. He voted to secure the border.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to back off her attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), saying it's a waste of time and Congress has higher priorities ahead of the November election.\n\nGreene filed her motion to vacate a month ago to protest the Speaker's handling of Ukraine aid, government spending and reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and Republicans have been dreading the moment when she forces a vote on the resolution. The Georgia Republican announced Wednesday she would move next week to bring it to the floor.\n\nOnly two House Republicans have publicly backed her effort, and she's not finding any more support among the ranks of Senate conservatives, many of whom believe Johnson is the right person to steer the conference and that a leadership change today would be political malpractice.\n\n\"It's a horrible idea,\" Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told The Hill. \"Moses could not do a better job than what Mike Johnson is doing right now.\"\n\n\"I think he's doing the very best possible [job] in the situation with a slim majority where the Democrats control the Senate and the White House,\" he continued. \"There's not a more conservative person over there that can be elected Speaker than Mike Johnson is.\"\n\nJohnson has been largely dismissive of Greene's effort to remove him from the Speakership using the same mechanism a different group of conservatives used to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in October.\n\nHe recently said in an interview that he does not consider Greene a serious lawmaker.\n\n\"We do the right thing and we let the chips fall where they may,\" Johnson told NewsNation, which is owned by the same parent company as The Hill.\n\nGreene's push is widely expected to fail. Johnson's conservative critics in the House have previously indicated they have little appetite for a repeat of the three weeks of chaos that ensued after McCarthy was removed.\n\nAnd Democratic leadership, along with rank-and-file members of the party, have pledged to help save Johnson's gavel after he put Ukraine aid on the floor, where it easily passed.\n\nStill, leading conservatives in the Senate wish the effort would go by the wayside.\n\n\"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said.\n\nSen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who is running for the Indiana governorship this year, noted the effort could harm the Republican agenda for the remainder of the year and said conservatives don't support it because there is no real fallback option.\n\nIt took three weeks and multiple failed candidacies for the House GOP conference to elect Johnson.\n\n\"Who's raised their hand that would want to be [Speaker]?\" Braun asked.\n\nGreene's effort has also been stymied by former President Trump's support for Johnson in recent weeks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also threw his full support behind the embattled Speaker earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm relieved as I think all of America is that the chaos in the House will be discontinued,\" McConnell told reporters Wednesday. \"I think it's a benefit to our country, a benefit to the House, a benefit to the reputation of Congress.\"\n\nWhile Johnson's recent series of bipartisan deals to keep the government open and to move on aid for Ukraine have angered a number of conservatives, many of them have been hoping to avoid a motion to vacate vote on the floor despite Greene's insistence of putting members on the record.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a leading House Freedom Caucus member, said recently that the ability to oust a Speaker \"exist for reasons, but they should be deployed sparingly\" -- a sentiment shared by some of his Senate colleagues on the right ahead of the November election.\n\nMost members would much prefer to focus on putting Trump back in the White House and winning control of Congress instead of what they see as a one-sided, petty fight.\n\n\"I think we'll be in a better position going into the fall if we stick together as Republicans,\" said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a former House Freedom Caucus member herself.\n\n\"Don't do it, don't do it. That would be my suggestion,\" she added.\n\nEven those most dissatisfied with Johnson in the Senate GOP ranks won't go so far as to throw their lot in with Greene this time around. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said multiple times in a brief interview that Johnson has \"done a terrible job\" since taking over the gavel, but declined to say whether he is supportive of the Georgia Republican's actions.\n\n\"They have to decide that.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and two other hard-liners furious with Johnson's bipartisan dealmaking, is likely to fail, ensuring the Speaker will keep hold of the gavel heading into November's elections.\n\nBut the vote is expected to break down in highly unusual ways, splitting both parties along strange lines that will produce odd alliances between ideological foes and see some of Johnson's most ardent critics rushing to ensure he remains in power.\n\nHere are the five groups to watch as the House decides the Speaker's fate.\n\nGreene is marching into this week's vote with an army of two -- Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) -- a small force that is poised to flounder amid bipartisan opposition to the motion to vacate.\n\nThe trio has strongly criticized Johnson for his propensity to cut legislative deals with Democrats, an anger that cropped up after the Speaker spearheaded a sprawling funding package, came to a boil when he supported a bill to reauthorize the U.S.'s warrantless surveillance powers, and spilled over after he muscled through a foreign aid package that included billions of dollars for Ukraine.\n\nOther hard-liners, to be sure, have expressed frustration with Johnson's track record, but have stopped short of joining Greene's effort. That, however, could change when the vote begins next week.\n\n\"I really don't have a number yet,\" Greene told reporters when asked how many Republicans will side with her. \"But this is the recorded vote that America needs to see.\"\n\nBut with the writing on the wall, proponents of the motion are trying to manage expectations, arguing that even if Johnson retains the gavel this time, the vote will show that he does not have a long-term future in the top job.\n\n\"I'll go out on a limb and predict there'll be enough votes to show that Mike Johnson can't be elected Speaker in January,\" Massie said. \"Because although he can get Democrat votes on a motion to table, it's not a motion to table vote in January 3rd, and hopefully when Mike Johnson sees that vote he'll know that he's a lame duck Speaker.\"\n\nFrustration with Johnson is running high in the House GOP conference -- especially among the right flank -- but those feelings will not be fully reflected in this week's vote. A large swath of conservatives say they will oppose the motion to vacate, despite their annoyance, to avoid chaos so close to the November elections.\n\nThose hard-liners, many of whom are members of the House Freedom Caucus, want to maintain a united front -- or as close to one that the conference can mount -- in the lead-up to November to avoid the image of disarray and, in turn, convince voters that they deserve another two years in the majority.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything to be gained by having a motion to vacate the chair at this point in time,\" Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) said.\n\nAnother concern among the right flank is the question of who would replace Johnson if he loses the gavel. With no clear successor in mind, conservatives have said they do not want to install a second-tier candidate who would be the incumbent during leadership elections for the next Congress.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to select someone now that would, in my view, probably [be] the less desirable, not the best option, perhaps, that would be an incumbent going into November,\" said Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), the chair of the Freedom Caucus who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\n\"I think we do the best we can with the Speaker that we have, influence him to the best of our ability, expose what we believe are wrong actions by not just the Speaker but everyone who is voting to support those actions, and have a contest to see who the conference can coalesce around as the best option in November,\" he added.\n\nThe right's anger toward Johnson has been matched by that of the Speaker's allies toward the center.\n\nThat more moderate group, made up of veteran lawmakers, committee chairs and, more generally, institutionalists who want the government to function smoothly, constitute a vast majority of the GOP conference. And they've lashed out at the hard-liners for much of the year, accusing them of ignoring the reality that no one gets everything they want in a divided Washington.\n\nThose Republicans were up in arms with the rabble-rousing conservatives who toppled McCarthy in October. They've been furious as the hard-liners have adopted the unusual tactic of tanking procedural votes to stall legislation and advance their demands. And they've defended Johnson through his deal-making efforts with President Biden.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) said there's a simple reason Greene is having so much trouble finding GOP support for removing Johnson.\n\n\"Because he's doing a good job,\" Lawler said. \"We've gotten our appropriations bills done; we've gotten FISA through the House; we've gotten the supplemental aid package done.\n\n\"For my colleagues that are upset about not getting border [security],\" he added, \"they should look in the mirror, because they weakened the Speaker's hand to negotiate when they wouldn't pass a rule.\"\n\nSuch frustrations have escalated in recent days, as rank-and-file Republicans -- particularly those, like Lawler, who face tough reelection contests -- are warning against another messy Speaker fight so close to November.\n\n\"Everyone realizes just how detrimental the motion-to-vacate process is, and I don't think it's a popular thing with our base, either,\" Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) said.\n\n\"At this point, so close to an election season, we need to get some spending bills to the floor, start the appropriations process, do no harm, not shoot our quarterback in the head in the fourth quarter, and go win elections.\"\n\nThe top three House Democrats -- led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) -- announced last week they would vote to table, or dismiss, Greene's vacate resolution, all but ensuring that the ouster effort would fail.\n\nThe move was unprecedented, and it marks a sharp contrast to the Democrats' approach to McCarthy's removal, which they supported unanimously.\n\nThe strategy also gives political cover to those Democrats who had vowed, even months before Greene filed her vacate motion, to protect Johnson from a conservative coup if he brought a short but highly consequential list of legislative priorities to the floor, including bills to prevent a government shutdown and provide more aid to Ukraine.\n\nNow that Johnson has helped usher those bills into law, many Democrats are ready to reward him for what they consider responsible governing.\n\n\"They're trying to boot him out because he did the right thing. And so we ought not to allow that to happen,\" Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) said.\n\nIt's unclear how many Democrats will vote to protect Johnson. But Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), the senior Democrat on the powerful Rules Committee, predicted it would be \"a big chunk\" of the caucus. And leadership -- while not whipping the vote, which they consider a matter of conscience -- are also promoting a desire to stabilize the chamber and prevent Greene from dictating how it's run.\n\n\"She is a legislative arsonist,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chair of the Democratic Caucus. \"And she is holding the gas tank.\"\n\nDespite the announcement from top Democrats that they will vote to table Greene's resolution, some liberals may stray from the pack and oppose the procedural vote to send a message that, in their eyes, Johnson is not a suitable leader for the Congress and the country.\n\nBefore taking the gavel, the Louisiana Republican had racked up one of the most conservative track records on Capitol Hill. And his positions on abortion, gay rights and the role of religion in government have made him toxic in the eyes of liberals, who don't want to go on record endorsing his leadership.\n\nJohnson, a former constitutional lawyer, also alienated Democrats because he was the architect of the legal reasoning behind the Republican effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and keep Trump in power -- an effort that led to the violent rampage at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWith Johnson's fate hanging in the balance, those postures are top of mind for Democrats.\n\n\"I may vote against it to send the message that Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nThe progressive New Yorker said the Democratic strategy could be two-pronged: provide enough votes to table the resolution, but then let other liberals oppose the gambit to showcase their displeasure with the Speaker.\n\n\"The 'yes' votes provide the functional purpose of what we need,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The 'no' votes allow us to maintain and uphold the message that Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader who seeks to strip abortion rights ... and who also supported overturning the election and setting the stage for Jan. 6.\"\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) offered a similar assessment.\n\n\"He's dangerous, he's an election denier, he's a fundamentalist, and he's not the leadership this country needs,\" Bowman said. \"Hopefully by November, if everyone comes out to vote, we'll be able to recalibrate Congress and begin moving in the right direction for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "wkbn.com", "dataType": "news",

It's not that Jeffries doesn't want to become speaker himself, but that will be decided by the American people six months from today, on Election Day, when all 435 seats are being contested.\n\nControl of the gavel should not be decided by wacko Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is pushing to topple Johnson because he actually did the correct and responsible thing. What the speaker did right was bringing to the floor an aid package for besieged Ukraine against the wishes of the isolationist wing of his own Republican conference.\n\nShamefully, the majority of his party colleagues voted no. The $60.8 billion for Ukraine passed two weeks ago relying on Democratic votes. Among Republicans, 53% of them voted no, while 100% of the Democrats voted yes. Putin hasn't conquered Kyiv, but he has captured the House Republicans.\n\nGreene, who is more MAGA-crazed than Donald Trump himself and sees hero Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the villain, wants Johnson out because of that.\n\nOn March 22, incensed as Johnson edged closer to allowing the Ukraine bill to come to the floor after the Democrats began collecting signatures for a discharge petition to force the Ukraine measure to the floor (as we had urged), she filed her own short motion, H.Res.1103, saying \"Resolved, That the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\" It is the same 17 words that were used to topple the previous Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWinding back to last fall, McCarthy's downfall started when he reasonably cut a deal with President Biden and Senate Democrats to keep the government funded on Sept. 30. It passed the House with 58% of the GOP on the bill, but still had to have Democratic votes to get the necessary two-thirds. So even though he had the backing of most of his conference, needing the Democrats was an anathema to the hardest core radicals.\n\nMcCarthy foe Matt Gaetz, who insisted when McCarthy first squeaked into power on the 15th vote that a single member be allowed to make a motion to vacate the chair, pushed the button on Oct. 3.\n\nMcCarthy's allies tried to table the matter, but 11 in his own party sided with the Democrats to let it advance. Then on the motion to vacate, Gaetz was joined by seven others. It only needed six defectors, so eight was plenty and McCarthy was ousted.\n\nGreene supported McCarthy throughout, so she wasn't in on the fun. But this it's all her doing. Johnson correctly ignored Greene's threats and moved ahead on Ukraine. She added isolationist Thomas Massie on April 16 and kook Paul Gosar on April 19. But Johnson stood firm and the House voted the next day, April 20, to aid Ukraine. It was Hitler's birthday, an earlier invader of Ukraine.\n\nThere are 217 Republicans and 212 Democrats (soon to be 213 when Tim Kennedy from Buffalo is seated). Having Greene and her two allies would be enough to overthrow Johnson if all the Democrats joined. But that won't happen. Tom Suozzi was the first to say no and now so has Jeffries and his leadership team. They are not supporting Johnson, but opposing Greene.

He was a consultant to the successful 2014 campaign of Larry Hogan for governor and served as chief of staff of the Maryland Department of Budget and Management from 2015 to 2023. He wrote this column for The Baltimore Sun.\n\nAs the former deputy chief of staff of the Republican National Committee when Republicans gained 63 U.S. House seats to establish a governing majority, I know something about winning elections. Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican, does not.\n\nI believe conservatives who believe she does are sleepwalking through their civic life and enabling America's leftward drift. So, to be blunt, it is time for those conservatives to wake up!\n\nRepublicans need to come back to the concerns of real Americans. What matters is not the move to vacate, in congressional parlance. What matters is the price of the weekly grocery bill.\n\nThe Republican Party that I love and have spent my life working on behalf of, is in danger of being viewed by a significant number of flag-loving Americans as a bunch of spoiled immature brats who would rather argue among themselves than defeat their real opponents in political and policy debate.\n\nRecently, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has won elections in a purple state, said that Greene \"is dragging our brand down.\" Tillis went on to call Greene \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\" U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican who represents a swing district, said that Greene's political theater must \"come to an end.\"\n\nThere is a prerequisite to making public policy. It is called winning elections. In today's America, winning elections does not start in the House Republican caucus. In fact, in a large part of America, winning elections ends there. The constant bickering, the infighting, the votes against moving legislation to the next level of the legislative process are self-defeating exercises that a huge majority of real Americans do not understand and care about even less. Now, Greene threatens to throw onto the political wreckage another grenade in the form of a vote to remove the conservative Republican Speaker of the House.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene may be a clickbait leader in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building. However, she and her ilk are totally irrelevant in the produce and meat aisles of the Safeways, Wegmans, Giants, Publixes and Albertsons across the American heartland.\n\nThere is a peace-and-quiet vote out there, and the Chaos Caucus, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, is driving it away from all Republicans, up and down the ballot.\n\nGoverning is about solving problems for hard-working American families. Until Republicans seize control of their messaging from Marjorie Taylor Greene and her amigos, including U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, my beloved conservative Republican philosophy will remain a minority view subject to self-inflicted ridicule by much of America. The Republican Party, and the conservative movement, will be better off when MTG comes to mean \"Marginalizing Taylor Greene.\"", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican, does not.\n\nConservatives who believe she does are sleepwalking through their civic life and enabling America's leftward drift. So, to be blunt, it is time for those conservatives to wake up! Republicans need to come back to the concerns of real Americans. What matters is not the move to vacate, in congressional parlance. What matters is the price of the weekly grocery bill.\n\nThe Republican Party that I love and have spent my life working on behalf of, is in danger of being viewed by a significant number of flag-loving Americans as a bunch of spoiled immature brats who would rather argue among themselves than defeat their real opponents in political and policy debate.\n\nRecently, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has won elections in a purple state, said that Greene \"is dragging our brand down.\" Tillis went on to call Greene \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\" U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a New York Republican who represents a swing district, said that Greene's political theater must \"come to an end.\"\n\nThere is a prerequisite to making public policy. It is called winning elections. In today's America, winning elections does not start in the House Republican caucus. In fact, in a large part of America, winning elections ends there. The constant bickering, the infighting, the votes against moving legislation to the next level of the legislative process are self-defeating exercises that a huge majority of real Americans do not understand and care about even less. Now, Greene threatens to throw onto the political wreckage another grenade in the form of a vote to remove the conservative Republican speaker of the House.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene may be a clickbait leader in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building. However, she and her ilk are totally irrelevant in the produce and meat aisles of the Safeways, Wegmans, Giants, Publixes and Albertsons across the American heartland.\n\nThere is a peace-and-quiet vote out there, and the Chaos Caucus, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, is driving it away from all Republicans, up and down the ballot.\n\nGoverning is about solving problems for hard-working American families. Until Republicans seize control of their messaging from Marjorie Taylor Greene and her amigos, including U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, my beloved conservative Republican philosophy will remain a minority view subject to self-inflicted ridicule by much of America. The Republican Party, and the conservative movement, will be better off when MTG comes to mean \"Marginalizing Taylor Greene.\"\n\nKevin Igoe, the former deputy chief of staff of the Republican National Committee and former executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, was a consultant to the successful 2014 campaign of Larry Hogan for governor and served as chief of staff of the

Then again, six months ago, no one thought the little-known Mr. Johnson would be Speaker at all - and hardly anyone outside of the famous Shreveport Orlandeaux's Caf\u00e9 could have identified him in a police lineup. Now, he's second in line to the presidency.\n\nAnd six months ago, when the Republican rebels seemed to have a chokehold on the House, no one expected their power to melt away.\n\nThe result of the expected Democratic assistance to permit Mr. Johnson to retain his wooden gavel is a twin reckoning and a twin weakening - the dissipation of the power of the Republican rebels who have wreaked havoc in the House and used their power in a closely divided body to exercise outsized control of the chamber; and the accompanying diminution of a Speaker, alienated from this onetime allies, who now must depend on his most ardent ideological foes to keep him in power and whose prerogatives are restricted by his rivals' policy priorities.\n\n\"We now have at least a momentary pause on the extreme right's ability to dictate much of what goes on in the House,\" said Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa. \"We've seen that segment exert incredible influence on the direction of the party and of Congress and this is a signal of some degree of pushback. You can almost hear people murmuring: Enough is enough.\"\n\nThat apparently will not stop Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia from attempting this week to dethrone Mr. Johnson, himself a reliable conservative who otherwise is comfortable in the far-right circle of fervent Donald Trump supporters that she occupies.\n\nShe has the power to set that process in motion because of the desperation of Mr. Johnson's predecessor, former speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, to win his position. Faced with a rebellion from the same far-right lawmakers who now are assailing Mr. Johnson, he granted a key concession: the ability of a single House member to call for a vote to declare vacant the office of the Speaker - in essence, to press for a recall of the presiding officer.\n\nThat is what toppled Mr. McCarthy 19 months ago, making him the only Speaker to be removed from his own onetime supporters. That is the bludgeon that Ms. Greene now plans to employ against Mr. Johnson. Though Ms. Greene says she has the support of several of her colleagues, only two other Republicans, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona, have publicly said they will join the effort.\n\nThe conservative rebels have grown increasingly impatient with Mr. Johnson, who they believe was too conciliatory to the Democrats and the Biden administration in agreeing to a measure to avoid a government shutdown and who they consider a turncoat in his successful effort to forge a coalition to provide a fresh US$95-billion infusion of military aid to Ukraine, Israel and to American allies in the Indo-Asia region.\n\nDefying party leaders who have counselled her that she is jeopardizing Republican unity and the effort to oppose Biden administration priorities, she has \"absolutely\" vowed to press ahead. Her ardour, and her argument that Mr. Johnson is an unwitting co-conspirator with Democrats grew sharper, after it became clear that the Speaker would be saved by Democratic votes - itself a remarkable phenomenon without clear precedent.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Ms. Greene said last week. \"He has proven it over and over again. Now we have [House Democratic Leader] Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats coming out, embracing Mike Johnson with a warm hug and a big, wet, sloppy kiss.\" On X, formerly known as Twitter, she wrote, \"Mike Johnson is officially the Democrat Speaker of the House.\"\n\nMs. Greene is no stranger to controversy. She suggested that the California wildfires of November, 2018, might have been triggered by a \"laser beam or light beam coming down to Earth I guess\" from space, speculating that the California utility PG&E and the Rothschilds, a banking family often prominent in antisemitic tropes, might be responsible.\n\nLast week, she voted against a House antisemitism measure, saying, \"Antisemitism is wrong, but I will not be voting for the Antisemitism Awareness Act of 2023 today that could convict Christians of antisemitism for believing the Gospel that says Jesus was handed over to Herod to be crucified by the Jews.\"\n\nMs. Greene knows that her attempt to remove Mr. Johnson is doomed to fail but wants voters to see Democrats salvaging his speakership. In that regard, she is often portrayed as more accomplished in the art of performance than in the art of politics.\n\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene is the star of the show,\" said Mr. Jeffries, the Democratic leader. \"The show is called Republicans Gone Wild.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everyone from Henry Clay to Amelia Earhart, Chief Standing Bear and Ronald Reagan stands as solemn reminders of the scale of historical and political achievement in American life.\n\nWalking through it must be a daunting experience for many new representatives. But if Marjorie Taylor Greene has ever stopped long enough to absorb the weight of that collective intellect and achievement, she has kept it well hidden. Her four years in Congress have been characterised by a seemingly limitless appetite for confrontation and a bewildering confection of wild conspiracy theories capable of causing jaws to drop in political contemporaries and perhaps even historical statues.\n\nHer vow this week to force a vote to oust her fellow Republican and House Speaker Mike Johnson guarantees another week where she dominates both headlines and head space in the Capitol. The decision by Johnson to amend and steer a crucial bipartisan bill through the House, guaranteeing a financial package to Ukraine, Israel and humanitarian aid to Gaza, was greeted as a rare triumph of bipartisan co-operation in a fractious Congress. But it placed Johnson directly in Taylor Greene's path of wrath. Vocally opposed to aid for Ukraine, she vowed at the time to force a vote to remove Johnson from his role - and thereby throw the House into further chaos. After a few weeks of will-she-won't-she, Wednesday's announcement confirmed her intention to force a vote that is predestined to fail, with Democratic representatives certain to vote to ensure that Johnson - and therefore some semblance of stability - remains.\n\n\"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again having supported a Republican speaker- a 'Christian Conservative',\" Greene said when she spoke to the media outside the building, using air quotes.\n\n\"Has the Republican Party finally learned their lesson? Are they willing to actually fight or are they going to just keep goin' along to get along? Because it's really easy to do that in Washington DC.\"\n\nFor the more moderate Republicans - the party has a slender majority in the House, 217 seats to 212 with six vacant seats - this represents another headache. One of the more recent departures from the House was Ken Buck, the Republican representative from Colorado who announced his resignation in March. Although staunchly conservative in his world view, he delivered a scathing rebuke of Greene during the bipartisan controversy, saying that \"she was always focused on her social media account. And 'Moscow Marjorie' is focused now on this Ukraine issue and getting her talking points from the Kremlin and making sure she is popular and she is getting a lot of coverage.\"\n\nThe name stuck and after the House passed the $61 billion aid package, the New York Post gleefully depicted a front page picture of Greene wearing a superimposed furry ushanka hat with the headline, \"Nyet, Moscow Marjorie\".\n\nThe image was humorous in a grim sort of way, but it was indicative of the national impact Greene has made in her four quick years on the Capitol. Many congressional representatives go through their entire political careers in virtual national anonymity. But Greene's emergence from rural Georgia, after a political awakening during the 2016 election, was distinguished by a series of opinions and theories that have quickly established her as the most vocal and extreme of the hardline Trump Republicans.\n\nShe has espoused conspiracy theories on everything from the cause of wildfires to the tragic death of John F Kennedy Jr in a plane crash in 1999. By 2021, Greene responded to the widening criticism and alarm caused by her world view by posting a \"message to the mob\" in which she declared that the \"smear campaign\" against her had led to $1.6 million in small donations into her campaign account and the consolidation of her support base in Georgia. It established a pattern: the more she is denounced by mainstream media, the more donations pour in.\n\nShe vowed in that message to never back down.\n\nShe was true to her word on that one. In July last year, she was ejected from the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus for repeated attacks on fellow Republicans. In March, she acted as agitator and heckler in chief during Joe Biden's state of the union address, and now comes her showdown with Johnson, whom, she has said, \"is not capable of that job\".\n\nIt's a fiery, provocative stance from one of Trump's arch-supporters and would-be vice presidential nominees. And it's a further reminder that however and wherever Greene goes, it will not be quiet.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Sunday for continuing to push for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) from office, saying that she was \"not acting in the best interests of President Trump.\"\n\n\"I don't want to predict what she will or won't do. She works virtually alone, with one or two other people who have expressed support for what she does. She's not bossing anyone around,\" Good, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said in an interview on NewsNation's \"The Hill Sunday.\"\n\n\"She is not acting in the best interests of President Trump. I don't think it's a good decision six months before the election. She always thought of herself first and foremost. And she has, you know, a personal animosity toward anyone that she deems responsible for the former president not being in office, with the exception of the former president, and she feels resentment toward those in the Freedom Caucus who removed her from the Freedom Caucus.\n\nGood reiterated his criticism of Johnson, saying he did not support his actions as House speaker, but that he did not think now was the time to fight for House speaker .\n\n\"I think we should have a speaker competition in November. I don't think President Johnson can win. I do not support the work he has done over the last six months, but we must do what it takes to re-elect President Trump, to expand the majority in the House and win back the Senate,\" Good added. .\n\nGreene has long criticized Good, who supported the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) against Trump in this year's GOP presidential primary. Good has since supported Trump.\n\nGreene filed her motion to resign a month ago in protest over the President's handling of aid to Ukraine, government spending and the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Republicans fear the moment when it will force a vote on the resolution. The Georgia Republican announced Wednesday that she would make the decision to run it this week.\n\nOnly two House Republicans have publicly supported her efforts, and she no longer finds support among Senate conservatives, many of whom believe Johnson is the right person to lead the conference and that a change in leadership today would be a political fault.\n\nGood sowed doubt about whether Greene would actually move forward this week with the motion to oust Johnson.\n\n\"I have no idea what she can or cannot do,\" he said, adding \"I doubt\" she will move forward with the motion \"because I think she heard, like the rest of us, in our districts, that the time the battle of the speakers will take place in November after the elections.\n\n\"Let's focus on expanding the majority in the House, winning back the Senate and re-electing President Trump,\" he said.\n\nThe Hill reached out to Greene for a response.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate against him, and said that Democrats who have said they will not pass the motion to oust him are looking \"pragmatically\" at the issue because the \"world's on fire.\"\n\n\"I think what they're looking at very pragmatically is that we don't need another three weeks where we functionally close the government because we don't have a speaker in place,\" the Louisiana Republican said on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show.\" \"Vacating the chair right now would be a dangerous gambit.\"\n\nGreene, R-Ga., said Wednesday she plans to force a vote next week on ousting Johnson, an effort that is expected to fail after Democrat leaders said they would vote to protect the speaker and after several other GOP leaders, including former President Donald Trump, said they oppose removing Johnson.\n\n\"We've got hot wars everywhere,\" Johnson told show guest host Alice Stewart. \"We've got challenges here at home, unrest on college campuses, an open border, all the rest. And so they're looking at that and saying, 'you know, the damage would be so consequential.' \"\n\nJohnson further confirmed that Trump has his back and said that he expects the former president to win in November.\n\n\"He has his big donor retreat this weekend,\" said Johnson. \"He's asked me to come and speak. I'm looking forward to that. I have a long relationship with President Trump. For eight years now we've worked together very closely. He and I came to Washington the same year, January 2017. Nothing's been normal since then, as we all know.\"\n\nHe also insisted that he did not request the Democrats to refuse to vote to oust him, even if it means they \"may need to hold their nose[s] and support a conservative Republican. I'm being called the most conservative Republican that's ever held the gavel of the speaker.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson said he doesn't think \"too much\" about Greene's motion to vacate, but he does think it's \"wrong for the Republican Party\" and the country.\n\n\"These are very serious times that we're living in and the American people need and deserve a functioning Congress,\" he said. \"I think that is the prevailing factor here. I think we are moving the ball forward incrementally.\"\n\nHe noted that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote in an opinion piece that Johnson has the toughest speakership since the Civil War, as Republicans only hold a one-vote margin.\n\n\"What that means is, as Republicans, as conservatives, we only control one-half of one-third of the federal government,\" said Johnson. \"Progressive Democrats control the White House and the Senate right now, so this is not a time for us to be able to throw Hail Mary passes on the field.\"\n\nHe added that he's \"bullish\" on the election cycle and believes Republicans can strengthen their majority in the House.\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \u2709\n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three decades in journalism and serves as a general assignment writer

Good: Greene 'not acting in the best interests of President Trump'", "body": "Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) on Sunday railed on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for continuing to push for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) from his position, saying she is \"not acting in the best interests of President Trump.\"\n\n\"I don't want to predict what she will or won't do. She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing. She doesn't lead anyone,\" Good, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, said in an interview on NewsNation's \"The Hill Sunday.\"\n\n\"She's not acting in the best interests of President Trump. I don't think this is a good move six months before an election. She's always been about herself primarily. And she holds, you know, a personal animosity towards anyone she deems responsible for the former Speaker not being in place, except for the former speaker, and she holds resentment to those in the Freedom Caucus who removed her from the Freedom Caucus.\"\n\nGood repeated his criticism of Johnson, saying he does not support his actions as Speaker but does not think now is the time to have a battle over the Speaker of the House.\n\n\"I think we ought to have a speaker contest in November. I don't think Speaker Johnson can win that. I don't support the work that he's done over the last six months, but we need to do the right thing for President Trump's reelection, for expanding the House Majority and winning back the Senate,\" Good added.\n\nGreene has long criticized Good, who backed the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over Trump in the GOP presidential primary this year. Good has since endorsed Trump.\n\nGreene filed her motion to vacate a month ago to protest the Speaker's handling of Ukraine aid, government spending and reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Republicans have been dreading the moment she forces a vote on the resolution. The Georgia Republican announced Wednesday she would move this week to bring it to the floor.\n\nOnly two House Republicans have publicly backed her effort, and she's not finding any more support among the ranks of Senate conservatives, many of whom believe Johnson is the right person to steer the conference and that a leadership change today would be political malpractice.\n\nGood cast doubt on whether Greene would actually move forward this week with the motion to oust Johnson.\n\n\"I have no idea what she may or may not do,\" he said, adding \"I doubt\" she moves forward with the motion \"because I think she's been hearing as the rest of us have, back in our districts, that the time to have a speaker battle is in November after the election.\"\n\n\"Let's focus on expanding the House majority, winning back the Senate, reelecting President Trump,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_fortinsky@thehill.com", "name": "Sarah Fortinsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Audio", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Audio", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/goodbob_031324ar01_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

In spite of the Republican Party's narrow majority in the House and the constant threat of a motion to vacate the chair, he will not let MAGA's most extreme lawmaker run the place.\n\nTo understand the significance of this moment, it's necessary to understand the changing culture of the MAGAfied Republican Party. After eight years of Donald Trump's dominance, we know the fate of any Republican politician who directly challenges him -- the confrontation typically ends his or her political career in the most miserable way possible, with dissenters chased out of office amid a hail of threats and insults. Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney are but a few of the many Republicans who dared to defy Trump and paid a high political price.\n\nBut there's an open question: Does the MAGA movement have the same control over the Republican Party when Trump isn't directly in the fray? Can it use the same tactics to impose party discipline and end political careers? If the likes of Greene or Steve Bannon or Matt Gaetz or Charlie Kirk can wield the same power, then the transformation of the party will be complete. It won't be simply in thrall to Trump; it will be in thrall to his imitators and heirs and perhaps lost to the reactionary right for a generation or more.\n\nI don't want to overstate the case, but Johnson's stand -- together with the Democrats' response -- gives me hope. Consider the chain of events. On April 12, Johnson appeared at Mar-a-Lago and received enough of a blessing from Trump to make it clear that Trump didn't want him removed. Days before a vote on Ukraine aid that directly defied the MAGA movement, Trump said Johnson was doing a \"very good job.\"\n\nDays later, Johnson got aid to Ukraine passed with more Democratic votes than Republican -- a violation of the so-called Hastert Rule, an informal practice that says the speaker shouldn't bring a vote unless the measure is supported by a majority within his own party. Greene and the rest of MAGA exploded, especially when Democratic lawmakers waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor. Greene vowed to force a vote on her motion to end Johnson's speakership. She filed the motion in March as a \"warning\" to Johnson, and now she's following through -- directly testing her ability to transform the House.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Corker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Corker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liz Cheney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Flake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Flake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kinzinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Kinzinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reactionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kirk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Kirk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/05/multimedia/05french-vwmg/05french-vwmg-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-12", "textStart": 2029, "textEnd": 2037}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

And how we're going to lead in shutting down the border, how we're going to stop the invasion, how we're going to stem the tide of inflation and massive spending that's happened over the past years and decades, and what we're going to do to make sure that peoples' lives are more affordable, more prosperous, and more successful,\" Mace said. \"That's the message that we need to focus on as a party.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_fortinsky@thehill.com", "name": "Sarah Fortinsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mace", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Mace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/macenancy_032024ar01_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

It's true she's not what most of us would consider particularly intelligent, but there really is something going on here, I think. A lot of it, I suppose has to do with her acceptance of QAnon Conspiracy theories, but after being in Congress you'd think she would understand her job a little bit better.\n\nBut in her latest attack on House Speaker Mike Johnson, which she posted on X, she clearly shows us she doesn't understand how Congress works, or even government in general works. And she couldn't be more wrong.\n\n\"no republican speaker should ever share power with the democrats.\n\nAmerican voters gave republicans in the house the majority for a reason.\n\nnow we see mike johnson was realy making deals with joe biden, chuck schumer, and hakeem jeffries to cling onto his power.\"\n\n\"mike johnson must resign or be removed.\"\n\nApparently, Greene doesn't understand that bipartisanship is supposed to be a thing. Democrats and Republicans are supposed to work together for the greater good of the American people. But Greene and a subset of other MAGA Republicans are not willing to do this. And she fails to mention that Republicans are barely hanging on to their majority in the House.\n\nOf course, after she posted this bilious tweet, she received the appropriate browbeating, but I think the most appropriate one was from @JaredRyanSears, who seems to understand Greene 100 percent.\n\n\"bipartisanship is not the bad word you make it out to be ms. Greene. it is how the process is supposed to work. it is how compromise happens,\" Sears posted in response.\n\n\"what you're really upset about is that maga spent almost a year and a half obstructing everything they could and hamstringing the speaker of the house. but you pushed it too far, so the rest of the republican party is done with you.\"\n\nThat, Newsweek reports includes prominent GOP Senator Thom Tillis, who has described her as a \"total waste of time\" and a \"horrible leader, during an interview with CNN's Lauren Fox in late April.\n\n\"she is a horrible leader. she is dragging our brand down. she, not the democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" tillis said.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, (R-N.Y.) is also fed up with Greene's theatrics and also noted this to CNN.\n\n\"her theater and this constant effort to hold the congress hostage has to come to an end. i'm going to have no part in it. and a good number of my colleagues, conservative and moderate believe that enough is enough. it is time to move on and to move past this kind of nonsense,\" he said.\n\nThen there's Rep. Don Bacon. He's a Nebraska Republican who represents a Biden-won district, and he's fed up with her, telling reporters earlier this week that most Republicans consider her effort to remove Johnson \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"ninety-eight percent of us find it disgusting,\" he said. \"i just try to ignore it. i can't help what she does. i think we'll overwhelmingly oppose it, and i think even on the democrat side, we'll have a lot of support. we're tired of the chaos. we're tired of this anarchy.\"\n\nGreen began this stupid nonsense in March, introducing the motion to vacate against Johnson (R-La.) after he worked with the Democrats to pass a $1.2 trillion spending package to fund the government. Of course, she further got things all stirred up by announcing on Wednesday that she plans to call a vote on her \"previously unprivileged motion to vacate against Johnson, and it's understandable as to why her colleagues are fed up with her shenanigans.\n\nI think that's what makes Sears's post so appropriate.\n\n\"you filed a motion for attention, and you are milking it for every last drop you can get.\"\n\nI think Sears gets the point. Greene is going to keep derailing Congress every chance she gets. I don't know how much she understands about her job, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't know or care so long as she can continue to disrupt everything until she gets her weirdly partisan way.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to back off her attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), saying it's a waste of time and Congress has higher priorities ahead of the November election.\n\nGreene filed her motion to vacate a month ago to protest the Speaker's handling of Ukraine aid, government spending and reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and Republicans have been dreading the moment when she forces a vote on the resolution. The Georgia Republican announced Wednesday she would move next week to bring it to the floor.\n\nOnly two House Republicans have publicly backed her effort, and she's not finding any more support among the ranks of Senate conservatives, many of whom believe Johnson is the right person to steer the conference and that a leadership change today would be political malpractice.\n\n\"It's a horrible idea,\" Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told The Hill. \"Moses could not do a better job than what Mike Johnson is doing right now.\"\n\n\"I think he's doing the very best possible [job] in the situation with a slim majority where the Democrats control the Senate and the White House,\" he continued. \"There's not a more conservative person over there that can be elected Speaker than Mike Johnson is.\"\n\nJohnson has been largely dismissive of Greene's effort to remove him from the Speakership using the same mechanism a different group of conservatives used to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in October.\n\nHe recently said in an interview that he does not consider Greene a serious lawmaker.\n\n\"We do the right thing and we let the chips fall where they may,\" Johnson told NewsNation, which is owned by the same parent company as The Hill.\n\nGreene's push is widely expected to fail. Johnson's conservative critics in the House have previously indicated they have little appetite for a repeat of the three weeks of chaos that ensued after McCarthy was removed.\n\nAnd Democratic leadership, along with rank-and-file members of the party, have pledged to help save Johnson's gavel after he put Ukraine aid on the floor, where it easily passed.\n\nStill, leading conservatives in the Senate wish the effort would go by the wayside.\n\n\"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said.\n\nSen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who is running for the Indiana governorship this year, noted the effort could harm the Republican agenda for the remainder of the year and said conservatives don't support it because there is no real fallback option.\n\nIt took three weeks and multiple failed candidacies for the House GOP conference to elect Johnson.\n\n\"Who's raised their hand that would want to be [Speaker]?\" Braun asked.\n\nGreene's effort has also been stymied by former President Trump's support for Johnson in recent weeks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also threw his full support behind the embattled Speaker earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm relieved as I think all of America is that the chaos in the House will be discontinued,\" McConnell told reporters Wednesday. \"I think it's a benefit to our country, a benefit to the House, a benefit to the reputation of Congress.\"\n\nWhile Johnson's recent series of bipartisan deals to keep the government open and to move on aid for Ukraine have angered a number of conservatives, many of them have been hoping to avoid a motion to vacate vote on the floor despite Greene's insistence of putting members on the record.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a leading House Freedom Caucus member, said recently that the ability to oust a Speaker \"exist for reasons, but they should be deployed sparingly\" -- a sentiment shared by some of his Senate colleagues on the right ahead of the November election.\n\nMost members would much prefer to focus on putting Trump back in the White House and winning control of Congress instead of what they see as a one-sided, petty fight.\n\n\"I think we'll be in a better position going into the fall if we stick together as Republicans,\" said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a former House Freedom Caucus member herself.\n\n\"Don't do it, don't do it. That would be my suggestion,\" she added.\n\nEven those most dissatisfied with Johnson in the Senate GOP ranks won't go so far as to throw their lot in with Greene this time around. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said multiple times in a brief interview that Johnson has \"done a terrible job\" since taking over the gavel, but declined to say whether he is supportive of the Georgia Republican's actions.\n\n\"They have to decide that. That's not for me to say,\" Paul said.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

Marjorie Taylor Greene: 'Everyone Should Be Terrified of Mike Johnson'", "body": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) joined Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM to discuss her effort, as expressed by host Matt Boyle, to \"expose Speaker Mike Johnson's power-sharing agreement with the Democrats.\"\n\nGreene announced Wednesday she will force a vote on a motion to vacate on the floor after House Democrat leadership said that they would protect Johnson's (R-LA) speakership.\n\n\"This isn't something that we want to be doing, but I think it absolutely has to be done,\" Green told Boyle about forcing the motion to vacate vote. \"Everyone always talks about the uniparty in Washington, DC. Well, the uniparty is on full display with the Democrats coming out saying that they will vote to save Mike Johnson and then yesterday it being reported in the news that they're going to extract some kind of deal from him in exchange for their vote.\"\n\nShe says voters deserve to know where lawmakers stand on the issue.\n\n\"This is exactly what Americans need to see as they go to primaries and vote as they're preparing to cast their ballots, not only in primaries, but in November,\" she said. \"The Republican majority was given to us by America because they were fed up with the Democrat agenda. Well, ever since we got Mike Johnson as Speaker, Mike Johnson, our Republican-elected Speaker of the House, has been delivering the Democrat agenda on a platter and giving Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and the Biden White House everything they want.\n\n\"And you know, Americans are fighting hard every single day to make ends meet. They're fed up with everything happening. And I think Republicans need to stand up and put on their big boy pants and do our job in Washington, DC, hold our own conference accountable. And we need to vacate the chair and we can put someone in that is willing to fight against the Democrats.\"\n\nBoyle discussed Johnson's three major policy capitulations - what Greene's colleague Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has called \"three betrayals\" - that led to her decision. Specifically, Johnson ended work being done to pass each of the 12 individual appropriations bills and passed a two-part omnibus bill overwhelmingly supported by Democrats, rammed through a reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) after casting the deciding vote to kill a warrant requirement for spying on Americans, and carried out a scheme to unlock tens of billions in Ukraine aid despite promising not to do so without addressing the border crisis.\n\n\"It's like he's nullified the midterm election and we didn't get a Republican majority,\" Boyle said. \"That's taking away the voices of millions of Americans who voted in the midterm election, right? We talk about threats to democracy. Well, here we go right here.\"\n\nBoyle referenced reports on what Democrats will demand from Johnson in exchange for saving him.\n\n\"One of the concepts that I think is going to become clear in the coming days, especially if they do vote as expected, the Democrats, to protect him, is what's called a power sharing agreement, right? ... So I think what we're gonna see is we're gonna see Mike Johnson to keep his job -- because he cannot win with Republican votes ... he is going to have to rely on Democrats to remaing the Speaker of the House.\"\n\nBoyle asked what more damage Johnson could do with a coalition government with Democrats for the rest of the year. Greene made clear the potential for further destruction is massive.\n\n\"I think everyone should be terrified of Mike Johnson,\" she replied.\n\nGreene first detailed the significance of Johnson's capitulations to Democrats thus far, beginning with spending bills. \"Let's walk through it. So he funded the government with a two-part omnibus, something we said 'No more Omnibuses, no more big spending package, twelve separate appropriation bills.' Well, that all stopped once they threw Kevin McCarthy out. We [had] passed seven separate appropriation bills; we only had five more to do when Mike Johnson became Speaker. He scrapped that entire plan and put together a two-part omnibus that he made a deal with Chuck Schumer on all the language in the bill and funded the government spending more money than Nancy Pelosi spent. And the omnibus was literally a policy copycat of Nancy Pelosi's omnibus. It funded full-term abortion, funded the trans agenda on children, fully funded the Department of Justice with all of the prosecutions going on, from J6ers all the way to President Trump with Jack Smith, fully funded the FBI that has raided Mar-a-Lago, and he gave them a brand new building.\"\n\nShe highlighted Johnson's flipflop on the warrant requirement, something a bipartisan coalition had been working to include in a FISA reauthorization for over a year.\n\n\"Then a week later or two weeks later, he comes out, reauthorizes FISA, and he is the deciding vote, votes down the warrant requirements - something that he was for six months ago, but all of a sudden he was the deciding vote and voted it down,\" she said.\n\nFinally she discussed perhaps the most high-profile Johnson flipflop, on Ukraine aid and the border.\n\n\"Then, a week later, he comes back with the foreign aid - foreign war package, it wasn't aid, foreign war - with over $100 billion to fund war all over the world: Ukraine, 26 billion to Israel, and then he puts a $9 billion poison pill in that aid money to Israel that goes to Hamas and Gaza,\" she said. \"He calls it Gaza aid, but we all know Hamas is the government of Gaza. So it goes directly to Hamas.\"\n\nShe also highlighted \"$3.5 billion in there that Joe Biden is going to use to bring in so-called refugees from Gaza - again, Hamas - into America, and Joe Biden wants to make them citizens, I'm sure so they can vote for him in November.\n\n\"I mean, the list goes on and on.\"\n\nGreen targeted the upcoming funding deadline as a major opportunity for Democrats to force more concessions from Johnson.\n\n\"This is where people need to realize it can go a lot further,\" she said. \"And I'll tell you, September 30, we have an another government funding deadline. So that big two-part omnibus everyone just saw happen, that was late. The deadline is September 30 coming up, we're supposed to do that again. What is Mike Johnson going to give away this time?\"\n\nDespite just receiving tens of billions of American tax dollars, Ukraine will ask for yet more money soon, with Johnson being the only person who could stand in its way.\n\n\"They said by the end of summer, the $61 billion that Americans just wrote a check for to Ukraine, that money is going to be spent and gone,\" she said. \"We'll have no idea where it went. We don't know the type of houses or yachts or cars or where that money is going to be stored and hidden away because we know that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt governments on Earth. So they're going to come back and they're going to say, 'Mike Johnson, we need another check for Ukraine.' That's going to be at the end of the summer.\n\n\"So there's a lot more damage that can be done and this is extremely dangerous.\"\n\nGreene had harsh words for her colleagues who want Johnson gone but argue now is not the time to vacate the chair.\n\n\"It doesn't matter that, 'Oh, Marjorie, it's six months away from November and the election. Can't you just wait and we agree with you about Mike Johnson? Can't you just wait till after then?' No, absolutely not. We have a job to do right now,\" she continued. \"And our job is to fight for the Republican agenda and America first agenda that voters gave us in 2022. Our job is not to whine and complain in Washington that 'Oh, this is just too hard for us. Oh, it's just too tough for us to go through.' That is complete surrender. And I can't be a part of it.\"\n\nShe spoke of the difficult reality facing millions of Americans due to Democrat policies Johnson has continued to unleash. \"Most people I know, Matt, are regular Americans. And regular Americans are scraping up their money to afford gas and bills. The food costs that they're having to pay for now is absurd. People have maxed out their credit cards trying to make rent. Young people today have no hope of ever owning a home. I mean, it's absurd what regular Americans are going through while stupid, pathetic, weak Republicans in Washington are all whining and complaining that 'Oh, it's too hard for us to hold our own Speaker accountable' and put someone else in that actually has a heartbeat, maybe that can create fog on a mirror because they actually breathe and can actually fight back against the Democrats. I'm just I'm so over it.\"\n\nNext week, Greene will provide Americans the opportunity to know exactly where their representatives stand, and who will join her in taking steps to actually solve the problems facing Americans and buck the uniparty.\n\n\"This vote next week, Matt, will give everybody a full list. It's gonna give everyone a full list of Democrats and Republicans. The ones that come together to save Mike Johnson -- that's your uniparty right there.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And now she's got Fox piling on so as Raw Story tells us Maniac Marge found a safe space, Steve Bannon's little daily hate fest to vent:\n\nDuring an appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast, the Georgia congresswoman claimed vindication in her efforts to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on the grounds that she had supposedly exposed the Republican establishment for being in cahoots with Democrats\n\nPersonally I don't think for a second Bannon disagrees with Fox's assessment of MTG but he knows damn well that this is the kind of \"gold\" that will get attention for his little show. So, as the linked article notes he (my characterization, not Raw Story's) egged her on:\n\n\"Because of your efforts... Politico's reporting that [Democrats and Republicans] are going to have a formal power-sharing agreement!\" Bannon exclaimed during the interview. \"Now that you've smoked them out, they've had to come forward!\"\n\nGreene kept going, getting specific about some imagined power sharing deal Speaker Johnson has had, or just made or... she maybe can't decide for sure with Democrats. If such a bargain has been struck it's news to everyone else. I suppose it's fair to say Johnson realized, because some (enough) Democrats publicly said so (unlike GOPers they keep their word) some old school horse trading went down. In this case critical foreign aid needed to pass. Needed to pass months ago in fact. And there's additional business that needs doing so the last thing the House needs is another cluster-f**k game of \"Who's Gonna Be Speaker?\" For Democrats, Johnson is the proverbial Devil they know, and Democrats indicated if he'll at least allow the House to function then enough will cross over to vote for him in a Speaker fight so he can keep his job.\n\nYo Marjie: That's not power sharing but simple doing what you have to do so Congress can do the people's business! Even Fox seems to realize this and is worried about this fall. They're probably going to lose the House already and the mess in the House might cost them regaining control of the Senate too. Should Biden win that means hopes of holding, or even improving their control of SCOTUS is gone so they want to see some semblance of normalcy - and MTG is doing all she can to prevent that.\n\nShe's being stupid. No surprise there but Fox so pointedly calling her that isn't just news, it's news GOPers can use to borrow a phrase. For us? It's entertainment! MTG of course doesn't see the logic of Fox's desire to see the GOP infighting die down. Like Bannon she wants to crash the whole damn system, soak it in gasoline and set it on fire. Which is why he has her on his show, and let's her take up airtime driving her point home and in fact she did reiterate her complaint:\n\n\"Fox News called me an idiot!\" Greene said. \"That was literally their headline -- they called me an idiot! But what I've done is expose what was already happening in the dark. And I think the beautiful thing about it is that I think Democrats have to come clean. They were controlling Mike Johnson anyways. He was giving them everything -- wide-open border policy, fully funded.\"\n\nGreene also whined about Johnson fully funding DOJ and the FBI. If you're thinking that seems weird from someone who's biggest complaint four years ago was that Democrats was to \"defund the police\" you're not alone. Of course she had plenty of company with fellow GOPers back then. Now the bulk of them are hoping the public has forgotten that. Well, hypocrisy is never in short supply in the modern GOP.\n\nWell, I don't know about you but I find it funny as hell that Margie's fee-fees are hurt about Fox calling her what she is. A dumbass. For those with strong stomachs if you want to listen to a snippet of what I've written about that includes a bunch of other bullshit lies then here you go.\n\nHope everyone has a nice weekend, and if learning Fox has soured (even if only for a while) on MTG helps you start it with a smile on your face I'm happy to have helped.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denis_elliott@politizoom.com", "name": "Denis Elliott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marge Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://politizoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-looney-tunes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536910", "eventUri": "eng-9536910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

She has accused the speaker of \"betraying\" his conservative roots and GOP voters and said that keeping him in power would ensure Democrats' control of the House next year.\n\nRep.

Rick Scott, R-Fla.\n\nScott is among the GOP lawmakers who have seized on what they believe is a lack of decisiveness in the response to pro-Palestinian protests, which have led to campus unrest across the country.\n\nRepublicans believe they have found a politically potent issue during this election year, which has quickly overshadowed what had been months of efforts to drum up support in Congress for the impeachment of President Joe Biden.\n\nThe shift in strategy was evident this week in the actions of House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer, who has led hearings in connection with the impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nThose hearings, often billed as an investigation into the \"Biden crime family,\" have failed to specifically connect the president to any evidence of wrongdoing involving international business deals reached by his son Hunter Biden.\n\nComer, R-Ky., along with other Republicans, was instead on the campus of George Washington University in downtown D.C. this week, questioning how Mayor Muriel Bowser has dealt with campus demonstrations.\n\nComer has scheduled a hearing related to the response to the GW protest for Wednesday and called on the mayor and the police chief to testify.\n\n\"We want to ensure that the Washington police is working with campus police to ensure the safety of Jewish students,\" Comer said.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., accompanied Comer and suggested that the mayor might need to call in the National Guard if the situation didn't improve.\n\nThe mayor, however, cannot activate the National Guard on her own since D.C. is not a state. That power rests with the U.S. president.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has directed committee chairs to carry out wide-ranging investigations into how college administrators are dealing with the demonstrations.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, has called for administrators from Yale, UCLA and Michigan to testify before her panel later this month.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans have threatened to penalize universities that don't adequately protect Jewish students on their campuses.\n\n\"These 'Little Gazas' are disgusting cesspools of antisemitic hate,\" said U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark, who's been an outspoken critic of universities. \"The Department of Education needs to withhold funding for colleges that won't protect civil rights for Jewish students.\"\n\nMore than 130 investigations involving the civil rights of students are underway, but they can take a long time to complete.\n\nDemocrats charge that Republicans have failed to back up their political rhetoric, by rejecting earlier proposals from the Biden administration to increase funding for civil rights investigations.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., suggested during a floor debate on an antisemitism bill that GOP lawmakers appear to have suddenly rediscovered threats to Jewish people.\n\n\"If my Republican colleagues were serious about antisemitism, they would have spoken up after neo-Nazis in Charlottesville chanted, 'Jews will not replace us,'\" he said.\n\nThe bipartisan antisemitism legislation passed overwhelmingly.\n\nThe Senate plans to consider the bill, but lawmakers said this week they wanted more time to review it.\n\nJohnson appears to be galvanized by the unity the GOP is showing in connection with the response to the campus protests. He's also predicting that the issue will hurt Democrats, who have been divided over issues involving Gaza and Israel.\n\nMany younger voters sympathize with the Palestinians and have been critical of President Biden for not doing more to pressure Israel to agree to a cease-fire.\n\nBut Johnson still has to deal with a political thorn in his side -- Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\nShe argues that Republicans will lose support from voters if they allow Johnson to remain as speaker, since he's been willing to work with Democrats.\n\nGreene plans to bring up a motion to vacate the chair this coming week, in an effort to oust Johnson from the speakership.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job. He has proven it over and over again,\" Greene said at a crowded news conference outside of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nBut Democratic leaders have said they will help Johnson keep his job, by voting to table Greene's motion, which would effectively kill it.\n\nGreene said she is undeterred and wants every lawmaker to go on record in a floor vote.\n\nThe Georgia lawmaker was flanked at her news conference by poster board pictures of Johnson embracing the House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nGreene accuses the political leaders of creating a \"uniparty\" that is only beholden to their own interests.\n\nBut Greene has found herself increasingly isolated. Many Republicans don't want the specter of chaos to return, as the campaign season ramps up.\n\nAnd while Green has indicated she still speaks regularly with former President Donald Trump, he appeared with Johnson a few weeks ago at Mar-a-Lago and praised him.\n\nThat appeared to reduce the political heat on Johnson, even though he will soon face a vote from a member of his own party to get rid of him.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

And that's not how you handle this. You don't negotiate with aspiring terrorists,\" said Johnson.\n\nEarlier this week Johnson announced a full House effort to stamp out the Hamas agitators on campus, holding a press conference with his most powerful committee chairs.\n\nAmong other things, the GOP grandees said axing federal funding for universities that fail to clean up antisemitism would be on the table.\n\nOn Wednesday the Lousiana Republican shepherded through Congress a broadly bipartisan bill to expand the definition of antisemitism.\n\nIt faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has refused to say whether he would bring the bill to a vote.\n\nReps for the White House also did not respond to multiple requests from The Post about whether President Biden would sign it.\n\n\"They are destroying property, they're waving Hezbollah and Hamas flags, they're breaking into buildings, they're chanting 'Heil Hitler,'\" Johnson said, explaining why he was so passionate about the issue. \"This is not a gray area.\n\n\"The Jewish students we spoke to had been verbally harassed and spit on. They've been told to 'Go back to the gas chambers.'\"\n\nJohnson reiterated his call for President Biden to send in the National Guard to unruly campuses, recalling President Eisenhower's 1957 decision to send federal troops to Little Rock, Ark. to integrate schools there when racist mobs and local leaders refused to do so.\n\n\"When schools are violating civil rights laws, and violating federal law, yes, there is an appropriate federal response. We need more Eisenhower and less Biden,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe speaker -- who, depending on the day, commands a perilous one seat majority -- told The Post he is confident he will retain his job despite growing calls for his removal by a clutch of far-right lawmakers opposed to his support of $60 billion in US aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe House rebels are led by perennial rabble-rouser Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who called the House vote a \"complete betrayal\" by Johnson.\n\nGreene filed a motion to vacate against Johnson -- the same procedure used to topple former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\n\"I can tell you that 99% of our conference agrees that this motion to vacate is wrong for our party, wrong for the institution and wrong for the country,\" Johnson said. \"It's a recipe for chaos. And it could happen at a very dangerous time.\n\n\"Marjorie enjoys attention. I think that's pretty clear,\" he said curtly.\n\nJohnson, who once was a Ukraine skeptic and previously voted against new rounds of funding for the country, famously pivoted on the issue -- something he attributed in part to new intelligence he received after becoming Speaker.\n\n\"Our own generals tell us that Ukraine would literally run out of ammo and defenses by the end of April. And so there's a fateful moment of decision.

Good has since endorsed Trump.\n\nThe Hill: Five House factions that will decide Johnson's fate.\n\nJeffries, interviewed on CBS News's \"60 Minutes,\" said it would customarily be the minority's instinct to let the majority stew in its own discord.\n\n\"But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people, then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos,\" Jeffries continued.\n\nFor Democrats, the situation at the border is a vulnerability for President Biden and for his party, the minority leader told CBS, but he pointed to voters' support for bipartisan immigration reform in survey after survey. Trump and Senate Republicans scuttled a bipartisan border bill this year on the theory that it was a compromise that might cost the GOP votes.\n\nOn voters' iffy reviews of Democrats' economic policies and the party's messaging about high costs, \"It's a work in progress,\" he conceded. On the flip side, abortion and reproductive rights are a vulnerability for Republicans who face the voters this year, he added.\n\n\"If Roe v. Wade can fall, anything can fall. Social Security can fall. Medicare can fall. Voting rights can fall.

The New York Times \"The Daily\" podcast focused on protests at the University of California, Los Angeles -- and Biden's response to the nationwide demonstrations.\n\n\u00a9 The Associated Press / Alex Brandon | President Biden at the White House on Friday.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL: Voters are six months away from an election unlike any in history, faced with a choice between two senior-citizen presidential contenders -- one the incumbent and the other his predecessor. Biden flies in and out of swing states while battling for a second term. Trump, railing against a \"Gestapo\" administration, returns to a criminal courthouse in Manhattan this morning.\n\nThe president will return to Wisconsin Wednesday for the fourth time this year, following two visits to the state by Trump. Ahead of his visit, Biden's campaign dispatched Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to Wisconsin to mobilize college students in another concerted effort to appeal directly to young voters, a group they're heavily investing in nationwide. The president has continued to struggle with low approval among voters under 45, particularly Gen Z and younger millennials -- the same age groups that decidedly voted for him four years ago (NPR).\n\nWith polls showing a tight presidential race in the battleground state, Trump rallied a crowd in Wisconsin last Wednesday around immigration and economic issues (The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel). But the former president declined to commit to accepting Wisconsin's November election results in an interview last week, his latest instance in hedging over whether he will contest the results of the election.\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" Trump told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview Wednesday. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\n\u25aa The Hill: Biden's reelection campaign is increasingly leaning on a longtime ally to play a starring role and help him pull off a win in November: Hollywood.\n\nTrump over the weekend traded a New York courtroom for Florida banquet halls, where he mingled with his vice-presidential contenders and wealthy donors during the Republican National Committee's (RNC) spring retreat in Palm Beach, Fla. Not included this year were several party rabble-rousers, including Greene, Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) (The Wall Street Journal and CNN). Here's who was in attendance.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will speak today at Johnson's Sunday to Monday donor event at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington. Team Johnson funnels its money through the entire House GOP fundraising apparatus (Punchbowl News).\n\n\u25aa Republican National Committee chief counsel Charlie Spies -- who previously worked for Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) during the GOP presidential primary and knows campaign law and Federal Election Commission rules -- will step down two months after taking the job, NBC News reports. The RNC cited time commitments.\n\n\u25aa Maryland's Senate Democratic primary between Rep. David Trone (Md.) and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks has turned sharply negative ahead of the May 14 contest to determine who will face former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\n\u25aa Trump was the guest of New York and Florida developer Steve Witkoff at Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix Sunday. Witkoff planned to throw a fundraiser for Trump. Not so fast, said race organizer and Miami Dolphins CEO Tom Garfinkel, who noted that VIP box license agreements bar campaign events.\n\nThe president will receive the President's Daily Brief at 9 a.m. Biden will depart Wilmington, Del., and return to the White House. At noon, he will present the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy to the United States Military Academy Army Black Knights football team. The president will have lunch at 1 p.m. with King Abdullah II of Jordan. Biden and first lady Jill Biden will host a Cinco de Mayo reception in the Rose Garden at 5:15 p.m.\n\nVice President Harris will travel to Detroit to continue her tour of cities in which she focuses on economic opportunity, especially for minorities, small business entrepreneurs and communities. She speaks at 1:55 p.m. before returning to Washington.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken is in San Francisco for the RSA Conference to discuss biotechnology and quantum information science and technology (RSA is the acronym for the basis of cryptographic algorithms used in securing sensitive data). He begins at 9:30 a.m. local time with biotech experts in Menlo Park, Calif., then meets with quantum technology experts in San Francisco at 11:30 a.m. local time. Blinken will deliver the RSA conference keynote speech in San Francisco at 3:50 p.m. local. He will then travel to Guatemala.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in her role as managing trustee of the Board of Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, will join a virtual meeting at 2 p.m. with Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley.\n\n\u00a9 The Associated Press / Patrick Orsagos | Proteserts demonstrated in January for transgender rights and health care in Ohio.\n\nCOURTS\n\nSALACIOUS CELEBRITY SCANDAL peppered with foundation-building evidence defined the second week of testimony in Trump's New York criminal trial. But key witnesses' credibility has also been sharply drawn into question, setting the stage for defense attorneys to take aim at critical future testimony. The Hill's Ella Lee and Zach Schonfeld have five key takeaways from week two of the trial and look ahead to week three.\n\n\u25aa The Hill: \"This was a crisis.\" On the witness stand, former Trump aide Hope Hicks detailed being at the center of Trump's 2016 damage-control operation.\n\n\u25aa USA Today: Would cameras in the courtroom change Trump's New York hush money trial?\n\nFIFTEEN REPUBLICAN-LED STATES have sued the Biden administration over new Title IX regulations -- which prohibit sex discrimination in schools and education programs that receive government funding -- that add protections for transgender students, setting up a legal battle over enforcement of the decades-old civil rights law and increasing the likelihood that the measures will be blocked in court before taking effect in August. The GOP-led states argue the new regulations are \"plainly illegal\" and undermine protections meant for cisgender students (The Hill).\n\n\"The timing and the sheer number of courts that have been invoked here sort of stack the odds against the Biden administration because there are just so many hoops to jump through,\" said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. \"You have to basically beat every single one of them to win. And if any one of them vacates the rule, under the general understanding today, that vacates it nationwide.\"\n\nELSEWHERE\n\n\u00a9 The Associated Press / Evan Vucci | National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan at the White House in April.\n\nThe talks are viewed by some U.S. officials as the \"last chance\" to avoid a return to all-out war in Gaza. Hamas claimed credit Sunday for a mortar attack on the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel; the Israeli Defense Forces alleged that the mortars were launched from Rafah, which Israel claims is Hamas's last stronghold and is determined to invade. CIA Director William Burns traveled to Doha Sunday night for an emergency meeting to salvage the hostage deal (The Hill and The Jerusalem Post).\n\nDespite concerns from Washington and other allies about the humanitarian implications -- more than a million Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah -- the planned attack remains a key sticking point in cease-fire negotiations. The Israeli army on Monday ordered tens of thousands of people in Rafah to start evacuating from the area, signaling that a long-promised ground invasion there could be imminent (The Washington Post and The Hill).\n\n\"Absent such a plan, we can't support a major military operation going into Rafah because the damage it would do is beyond what's acceptable,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday at the Sedona Forum in Arizona.\n\nHOLD ON AMMUNITION: The Biden administration last week put a hold on a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel, Axios reports. The White House did not comment on the reason for the pause, but Biden is facing sharp criticism among Americans who oppose his support of Israel as the humanitarian toll in Gaza mounts.

However, another factor that adds to the difficulty is that the company responsible for direct emissions, otherwise known as the Scope 1 party in carbon accounting, often cannot cover the full cost of decarbonizing its operations. For example, the most effective way for the air transport sector to reach its climate goals is through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, airline profit margins are low, about three percent according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Because SAF can cost at least two times more than conventional jet fuel, and with approximately 25 percent of an airline\u2019s operating costs going to jet fuel, the airlines don\u2019t have the ability to cover this premium without help. Insets, which represent decarbonization within the sector\u2019s value chain, are a way to include downstream customers in the process. With insets, a company with Scope 3 emissions from air travel, like Microsoft Microsoft , can mitigate their indirect emissions from things like business travel and air cargo, while also accelerating the energy transition by buying directly from renewable fuel producers like World Energy. Microsoft\u2019s purchase of World Energy insets helps to cover the cost premium of the fuel while also providing a market demand signal, which provides certainty for financiers and leads to investment in additional renewable fuel infrastructure. However, despite the benefits, there are still some potentially avoidable obstacles to this approach. Avoiding moral hazards Global carbon accounting systems do not yet recognize assets. Besides proving that the inset is additional (meaning it provides benefits above the status quo), NGOs focused on global carbon accounting systems are concerned that a Scope 1 company might get a free pass for emissions they are responsible for. When a company has another party intervene on their behalf it can disincentivize a polluter to act. This is referred to as a \u201cmoral hazard.\u201d (Think about a group project in school and the kid who doesn't do their share of the project because they know everyone else will pick up the slack.) Prioritizing Climate Mitigation Actions Source: Modification of Terrascope's Mitigation Hierarchy In the hierarchy of preferred climate action, companies should first prevent and eliminate emissions. However, for hard-to-abate industries like aviation, solutions don\u2019t exist at-scale today, and energy transition progress will stall if only Scope 1 companies, like airlines, are recognized in accounting systems. Airlines simply cannot meet their 2050 climate goals with this approach.

Recently at the Smart Freight Week annual conference in Amsterdam, IATA proposed an accounting approach that would make agreements between SAF producers and corporate end customers all but impossible. (Full disclosure: my company, World Energy, has many of these types of contracts.) Airlines want to avoid the potential for SAF credits to be claimed or retired without including the Scope 1 party, which some have called \u201cOrphaned Scope 1\u201d credits. IATA also suggested that the GHG protocol require credits to be transferred from the Scope 1 to the Scope 3 beneficiary rather than transferring from Scope 3 to Scope 1. Additionally, IATA interpreted the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) aviation guidance that SAF benefits must be transferred down the supply chain to mean that airlines need to hold title before the Scope 3 companies. Luckily, both airline concerns already have solutions. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Book & Claim guidance mandates a named airline party for valid emission reductions and SAF registries require a named Scope 1 party before a credit can be retired. Additionally, in follow up dialogue with the SBTi aviation guidance authors, they confirm that a Scope 3 party could contract with an upstream supplier without an airline. The guidance states, \u201cProve clear chain of custody for the SAF consumption down, rather than across, the value chain.\u201d The \u201cdown\u201d direction was included to reduce the potential for trades \u201cacross\u201d a value chain (e.g., one airline to another airline). The real need: radical collaboration Looking back to my high school days, the best group projects were the ones where the group worked collaboratively, and everyone had a part to play. When the GHG protocol created the concept for supply chain (Scope 3) emissions, multiple parties became responsible for the same CO2 emissions. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Clean Skies for Tomorrow built on the same logic for its mitigation solution\u2014in effect, multiple companies in the value chain could pay for the same action and spread the cost burden. Multiple parties can share responsibility and benefits Source: Modification of Sustainable Aviation Buyer's Alliance SAF costs Rigorous measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) is necessary to make a shared multi-scope solution possible. Fortunately, we have the knowledge and the technology along with standards, auditors, and digital registries. The multi-scope solution offers the potential creditworthy counter party, like Microsoft, to buy from a SAF producer like World Energy. Offtakes like this will generate capital from banks and investors. Reducing demand side risk will lower the interest rates for loans, and those benefits can be passed onto customers in the way of lower cost products. But to realize this vision we need acceptance from regulators, economic operators, and interested NGOs that shared mitigation benefit isn\u2019t a moral hazard. We need the companies who combust the fuel to embrace the shared mitigation approach without eliminating crucial solutions like Scope 3 offtakes. There are several NGOs ready to support this approach including the Book & Claim community, RSB, and the Advanced and Indirect Mitigation (AIM) platform. The clearest path towards meaningful decarbonization is for airlines to adopt a collaborative approach to shared mitigation rather than creating a standard that is owned and operated by airlines alone. Producers, airlines, Scope 3 parties, regulators, and voluntary bodies all have a role to play, and climate mitigation should be a shared responsibility in situations where the Scope 1 company cannot pay the full cost. Collaboration with renewable fuel suppliers, and leading NGOs supporting this approach can forge novel solutions that recognize collective action in hard-to-abate sectors like aviation. The result is that every individual on this climate project will play a part in meeting goals that are even more critical than earning a solid GPA. Follow me on Twitter.

The Israeli prime minister's office has declined to comment at this stage.\n\nIt's unclear whether Hamas has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal, as outlined last week, or a revised version of it.\n\nThe most recent framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAfter the initial exchange, according to that framework, there would follow what sources describe as the \"restoration of sustainable calm\" during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.\n\nA diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN that after a day-long meeting in Doha, Qatar's capital, between CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, mediators had convinced Hamas to accept a three-part deal.\n\n\"The bill is now firmly in (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu's court,\" the source said.\n\nThe White House on Monday confirmed that there had \"been a response from Hamas\" to a proposed hostage deal in Israel, and that US President Joe Biden had been briefed on that response, but otherwise declined to weigh in specifically on what a deal could entail.\n\nBiden is \"aware of where the situation and where the process is,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby told a press briefing. CIA Director Bill Burns remains in the region \"working in real time on the ground,\" Kirby added.\n\n\"We still believe that reaching an agreement is the absolute best outcome not only for the hostages, but for the Palestinian people and we're not going to stop working to that outcome,\" he said.\n\nAs news spread in Gaza of Hamas' announcement, Palestinians began to celebrate in the street in Deir al-Balah, in the center of the Strip, and Gaza City in the north.\n\nThe news comes just hours after Israel ordered Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nThe order raised fears that Israel's long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of the north of Gaza.\n\nA source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release.\n\nIDF operations ongoing\n\nAsked whether Hamas' acceptance of a deal could change Israel's plans for Rafah, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the military would continue to operate in Gaza. He said operations are ongoing, but that the IDF is making every effort in the negotiations to bring the hostages home as \"fast as possible.\"\n\nNetanyahu has come under fierce pressure from the more extreme wing of his coalition not to accept the ceasefire proposal outlined last week, and to focus instead on destroying Hamas in Rafah.\n\nOrit Strook, Israel's settlements minister and a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, said last week that accepting the deal would \"throw\" Israel's military progress \"in the trash.\"\n\nItamar Ben Gvir, Israel's national security minister, said Netanyahu had \"promised that Israel would enter Rafah, assured that the war would not end, and pledged that there would be no reckless deal.\"\n\nBut large parts of the Israeli public have demanded Netanyahu accept a deal. Families and supporters of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv last week, holding a banner reading: \"Rafah or the hostages - choose life.\"\n\nBenny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet but seen as a rival and possible successor to Netanyahu, said the return of hostages was more urgent that entering Rafah.\n\nResponding to Monday's announcement, the Hostages Families Forum said: \"Now is the time for all that are involved, to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Israeli prime minister's office has declined to comment at this stage.\n\nIt's unclear whether Hamas has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal, as outlined last week, or a revised version of it.\n\nThe most recent framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAfter the initial exchange, according to that framework, there would follow what sources describe as the \"restoration of sustainable calm\" during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.\n\nA diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN that after a day-long meeting in Doha, Qatar's capital, between CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, mediators had convinced Hamas to accept a three-part deal.\n\n\"The bill is now firmly in (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu's court,\" the source said.\n\nThe White House on Monday confirmed that there had \"been a response from Hamas\" to a proposed hostage deal in Israel, and that US President Joe Biden had been briefed on that response, but otherwise declined to weigh in specifically on what a deal could entail.\n\nBiden is \"aware of where the situation and where the process is,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby told a press briefing. CIA Director Bill Burns remains in the region \"working in real time on the ground,\" Kirby added.\n\n\"We still believe that reaching an agreement is the absolute best outcome not only for the hostages, but for the Palestinian people and we're not going to stop working to that outcome,\" he said.\n\nAs news spread in Gaza of Hamas' announcement, Palestinians began to celebrate in the street in Deir al-Balah, in the center of the Strip, and Gaza City in the north.\n\nThe news comes just hours after Israel ordered Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nThe order raised fears that Israel's long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of the north of Gaza.\n\nA source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release.\n\nIDF operations ongoing\n\nAsked whether Hamas' acceptance of a deal could change Israel's plans for Rafah, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the military would continue to operate in Gaza. He said operations are ongoing, but that the IDF is making every effort in the negotiations to bring the hostages home as \"fast as possible.\"\n\nNetanyahu has come under fierce pressure from the more extreme wing of his coalition not to accept the ceasefire proposal outlined last week, and to focus instead on destroying Hamas in Rafah.\n\nOrit Strook, Israel's settlements minister and a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, said last week that accepting the deal would \"throw\" Israel's military progress \"in the trash.\"\n\nItamar Ben Gvir, Israel's national security minister, said Netanyahu had \"promised that Israel would enter Rafah, assured that the war would not end, and pledged that there would be no reckless deal.\"\n\nBut large parts of the Israeli public have demanded Netanyahu accept a deal. Families and supporters of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv last week, holding a banner reading: \"Rafah or the hostages - choose life.\"\n\nBenny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet but seen as a rival and possible successor to Netanyahu, said the return of hostages was more urgent that entering Rafah.\n\nResponding to Monday's announcement, the Hostages Families Forum said: \"Now is the time for all that are involved, to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType":

The Israeli prime minister's office has declined to comment at this stage.\n\nIt's unclear whether Hamas has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal, as outlined last week, or a revised version of it.\n\nThe most recent framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAfter the initial exchange, according to that framework, there would follow what sources describe as the \"restoration of sustainable calm\" during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.\n\nA diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN that after a day-long meeting in Doha, Qatar's capital, between CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, mediators convinced Hamas to accept a three-part deal.\n\n\"The bill is now firmly in (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu's court,\" the source said.\n\nThe United States is also reviewing Hamas' response and \"discussing it with our partners in the region,\" State Department Matthew Miller said.\n\n\"We continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the best interests of the Israeli people. It's in the best interest of the Palestinian people. It would bring an immediate ceasefire, it would allow increased movement of humanitarian assistance and so we're going to continue to work to try to reach one,\" he said.\n\nAs news spread in Gaza of Hamas' announcement, Palestinians began to celebrate in the street in Deir al-Balah, in the center of the Strip, and Gaza City in the north.\n\nThe news comes just hours after Israel ordered Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nThe order raised fears that Israel's long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of the north of Gaza.\n\nA source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release.\n\nIDF operations ongoing\n\nAsked whether Hamas' acceptance of a deal could change Israel's plans for Rafah, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the military would continue to operate in Gaza. He said operations are ongoing, but that the IDF is making every effort in the negotiations to bring the hostages home as \"fast as possible.\"\n\nNetanyahu has come under fierce pressure from the more extreme wing of his coalition not to accept the ceasefire proposal outlined last week, and to focus instead on destroying Hamas in Rafah.\n\nOrit Strook, Israel's settlements minister and a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, said last week that accepting the deal would \"throw\" Israel's military progress \"in the trash.\"\n\nItamar Ben Gvir, Israel's national security minister, said Netanyahu had \"promised that Israel would enter Rafah, assured that the war would not end, and pledged that there would be no reckless deal.\"\n\nBut large parts of the Israeli public have demanded Netanyahu accept a deal. Families and supporters of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv last week, holding a banner reading: \"Rafah or the hostages - choose life.\"\n\nBenny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet but seen as a rival and possible successor to Netanyahu, said the return of hostages was more urgent that entering Rafah.\n\nResponding to Monday's announcement, the Hostages Families Forum said: \"Now is the time for all that are involved, to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Families and supporters of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv last week, holding a banner reading: \"Rafah or the hostages - choose life.\"\n\nBenny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet but seen as a rival and possible successor to Netanyahu, said the return of hostages was more urgent that entering Rafah.\n\nCNN", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The war cabinet has decided that Israel will continue its operations in Rafah, with the army announcing it has struck targets in the east of the city.\n\nIt remains to be seen which version of the ceasefire proposal Hamas has accepted -- whether it is the most recent one discussed or a modified version.\n\nThe proposal under consideration, which was contributed to by Israel but not yet fully agreed upon, entails releasing 20 to 33 hostages in phases in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe agreement outlines subsequent steps towards \"the restoration of sustainable calm,\" which includes the exchange of remaining hostages and captive Israeli soldiers for more Palestinian prisoners.\n\nA significant breakthrough occurred in Doha, according to a diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations.\n\nA diplomatic source revealed to CNN that after a day-long meeting in Doha, Qatar's capital, between CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Hamas was persuaded to accept a three-part deal. The source emphasized, 'The ball is now firmly in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's court.'\n\nAt the White House, the tone was cautiously optimistic. \"There had been a response from Hamas,\" confirmed national security spokesman John Kirby, noting that President Joe Biden had been briefed but declined to detail the specifics of the deal. \"We still believe that reaching an agreement is the absolute best outcome not only for the hostages but for the Palestinian people, and we're not going to stop working toward that outcome,\" Kirby stated.\n\nThe news of Hamas's announcement sparked celebrations in Gaza, with Palestinians taking to the streets in Deir al-Balah and Gaza City.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages in Gaza stated that since Hamas has agreed to the deal, the Israeli government must now agree as well.\n\nSimultaneously, the mood was tense in Rafah, a southern Gaza city, following an Israeli command to \"evacuate immediately,\" hinting at possible imminent military actions.\n\nAsked about the implications of Hamas's acceptance on Israeli military plans, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari remarked that operations would continue. \"Operations are ongoing, but the IDF is making every effort in the negotiations to bring the hostages home as fast as possible,\" Hagari stated.\n\nThe ceasefire discussions have stirred strong reactions within Israel's political landscape. Orit Strook and Itamar Ben Gvir, representing the far-right factions, have expressed opposition to the ceasefire, advocating for continued military pressure on Hamas in Rafah.\n\nIn contrast, public pressure mounts for Netanyahu to agree to the ceasefire, underscored by protests by families and supporters of the hostages, who recently blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv with banners urging the Prime Minister to \"choose life.\"\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNWRA) estimates there are 1.4 million people sheltering there, half of them children.\n\nUNRWA spokesman Jonathan Fowler spoke to Al Jazeera from occupied East Jerusalem on Israel's evacuation order in Rafah ahead of the planned ground offensive:\n\n\"We are in a situation where any large-scale advances from Israeli forces in Rafah are going to mean more suffering and death. The consequence would be devastating for the population of Rafah, which is six times the pre-war population - half of the 1.4 million people are children. Most of these people have been displaced many times already. The challenge is insurmountable at this stage.\"\n\nAt least 34,735 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's ongoing offensive on the Gaza Strip since last October, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Monday.\n\nA ministry statement added that 78,108 other people have also been injured in the onslaught.", "source": {"uri": "gutzy.asia", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gutzy Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

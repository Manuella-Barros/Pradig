The Corrs singer and musician is this month\u2019s Guest Beauty Editor for RSVP and shared with us her must-have skincare products that help her deal with sensitive skin. Sharon\u2019s confidence has grown with age and she is more comfortable in her skin these days.

I\u2019m less self conscious and I embrace my body a lot more. I feel like there are more important things in life to worry about and I\u2019d rather have a good chat and laugh with my family and friends,\u201d she told RSVP. \u201cBack in the 1990s, at the height of The Corrs\u2019 fame, it was a highly pressurised time for us as a band. Besides touring and performing around the world, we were under pressure to conform to a certain body image and to always look amazing. Sadly, things are probably not much different today for young girls, but it\u2019s up to us to tell them they don\u2019t need to look perfect online.\u201d Sharon has sensitive skin and has found Boots\u2019 No7 Future Renew Range works wonders for her complexion. She said: \u201cMy creams are very important to me. I have been using this range for over a year now and I can already see an improvement in the texture and tone of my skin. As a 54-year-old mum living in Spain, it\u2019s not easy to keep that radiance going, believe me!\u201d Sharon\u2019s hero product from No7\u2019s Future Renew Range is the Damage Reversal Serum (\u20ac54.99, Boots). \u201cThis serum is my go-to every day. It\u2019s filled with lots of good-for-skin ingredients that are clinically proven to reverse visible signs of sun damage with results getting better every time. It won\u2019t leave skin feeling sticky and it works well under make-up,\u201d she explained. Sharon also loves to use the UV Defence Shield SPF 50, which you can pick up from Boots for \u20ac32.99. \u201cI do not like heavy sunscreen. I find that many SPF 50s can feel thick but this new one is hydrating and lightweight with an invisible finish. It helps to provide a defensive shield against UV in sunlight which can cause visible signs of skin damage. I\u2019m hooked.\u201d When it comes to make-up, Sharon uses an old reliable for good coverage \u2013 MAC\u2019s Studio Fix Fluid Foundation. She added: \u201cI adore this buildable, breathable foundation that melts beautifully onto my skin.\u201d Shop the product for \u20ac42 online here.

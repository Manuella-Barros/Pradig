It also means getting the timing of your flight right. In 20 years as a travel agent, The Travel Expert Sarah Slattery (thetravelexpert.ie) has seen many different parent-and-kids scenarios. \u201cFrom parents bringing baby away for the first time, to families where the five-year-old dictates the holiday agenda, to families with teens.\u201d The mum-of-two says lots of families don\u2019t look at the big picture when planning flight times. \u201cThey look at the lead-in price and book a 6am flight because it\u2019s cheaper. They end up paying for breakfast at the airport. The children are cranky. \u201cThey\u2019re on a seven-day holiday and they arrive exhausted \u2014 they\u2019ve wasted a whole day trying to save \u20ac100,\u201d she says, adding that it might make more sense to book a 10am flight, have breakfast at home, an easier flight, and arrive refreshed. Slattery advises choosing times when children are likely to sleep \u2014 or alternatively are wide awake to comfortably enjoy the flight. Be bag-savvy Get rid of \u201csilly suitcases that hold very little\u201d and invest in a lightweight 10kg cabin bag for your child, recommends Slattery. \u201cIt gives you maximum space and you don\u2019t have to pay for it.\u201d Mum of three children aged 12, 11, and eight Sheena Mitchell says in her experience young children often want to bring their own backpacks. \u201cWhich is fine if they\u2019ll carry them \u2014 but it\u2019s more the notion of bringing their own bag that appeals, rather than the carrying.\u201d She advises letting them bring a small backpack with their favourite teddy and a book \u2014 and making sure their backpack fits in yours. Lighten the load Slattery recommends contacting your hotel before travelling so as to avoid bringing items you won\u2019t need. \u201cFind out what equipment they have \u2014 maybe buggies, strollers, sterilisers, bottle warmers. A lot of good family hotels have these on-site. Pre-book equipment if possible.\u201d And while you\u2019re at it, Slattery also suggests asking for an early check-in or late check-out \u2014 and a ground floor room, if that is your preference. Buggies and extras \u201cMany airlines allow you to bring a buggy or stroller free of charge \u2014 as well as one other piece of equipment, such as a car seat, booster seat or travel cot,\u201d says Slattery, who sees this second free item as a great gift for families travelling with a baby. \u201cParents understandably get worked up about car seats. They worry that a local taxi driver won\u2019t have car seats. Bringing your own as a second piece of equipment solves this.\u201d Sheena Mitchell, a Dublin-based pharmacist, has personally experienced the car seat dilemma. \u201cOn one holiday, there was only a booster seat available for my then three-year-old, who needed a high-back booster with a five-point harness. The standards we have in Ireland for rear-facing, robust car seats don\u2019t seem to exist in some other countries.\u201d While the facility isn\u2019t always available, she advises looking in the airport for companies renting decent child car seats \u2014 these are often separate from car rental companies. Mitchell, whose eldest was three-and-a-half when her youngest was born, recalls when they checked in the buggy \u2014 and made life more difficult for themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating because you then have no buggy to get them to the plane, which is a long way.\u201d In situations like this, she recommends investing in a secondhand, collapsible double-buggy. \u201cYou can fit two children, and if it gets broken, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d Take seat control Pay a bit extra to make sure you have seats together, urges Mitchell, who recalls one trip when all the children\u2019s clothes were in one bag, her husband was seated on one end of the plane with one child and the bag, and she was at the other end with two children and no bag. \u201cHave a clear plan of who is sitting where. Don\u2019t be relying on the goodwill of other passengers \u2014 remember there might be other families in the same situation. Ensure you take control of the situation and if necessary pay for seats together.\u201d \u2019I\u2019m hungry\u2019 Slattery\u2019s children are in their teens but she recalls Tuc crackers being a popular go-to snack. \u201cYou can never have too many snacks \u2014 double what you think you\u2019ll need in case of delays.\u201d She urges not relying on airplane food. \u201cIt can be hit and miss and, depending on where you\u2019re sitting, your choice may not be available.\u201d Instead, she says, look out for meal deals in airport shops. \u201cYou could get a sandwich, crisps and a drink for \u20ac6 \u2014 much cheaper than airplane food. And give children the freedom to pick their own \u2014 they\u2019ll be more likely to eat it then.\u201d Divert and distract \u201cA lot of the reason why children act up when travelling is because they\u2019re bored and tired,\u201d says Slattery, who nevertheless believes \u2014 with the exception of the crawling age \u2014 that travelling with babies and toddlers on airplanes shouldn\u2019t be a big ordeal. \u201cIn most cases, they\u2019ll have a nap, and once you bring plenty of snacks and toys to keep them entertained, it\u2019s usually fairly straightforward.\u201d She recommends bringing a new toy or colouring/activity/sticker book \u2014 maybe even a few \u2014 and strategically bringing them out throughout the journey. Also, download movies or the kids\u2019 favourite TV shows onto tablets or phones before you go \u2014 don\u2019t forget headphones. Whatever your usual screen rules, Mitchell says travelling with children is one time she\u2019s willing to concede on these. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place, we\u2019re lucky to have technology as a tool and there\u2019s no point in being a martyr. It\u2019s a family holiday, your priority is your kids \u2014 but certain things can make life easier.\u201d Mind their ears With babies, Mitchell advises timing breast- and bottle-feeding for take-off and landing. \u201cIt will equalise pressure in their inner ear and they won\u2019t suffer from pain. A soother can be really useful too because they\u2019re working their jaw.\u201d Get older children to yawn. \u201cYawning can be contagious \u2014 let them copy you,\u201d says Mitchell who is not a fan of sucking sweets, especially if managing multiple children. \u201cThere\u2019s a choking risk,\u201d she says. Little details Small things can really matter \u2014 like Calpol or travel-sized sunscreen \u2014 when you reach your destination and have to wait in the hot sun for transport. Mitchell recommends bringing a spare set of clothes and an individual ziplock bag for each child. \u201cKeep them in your hand luggage. So if there are any spills, nappy leaks or wet clothes, you can bring the child to the bathroom, change them and put the dirty clothes in the ziplock bag.\u201d If there are tears Slattery\u2019s advice to parents of a screaming toddler: \u201cTry not to let it bother you too much. Most people expect it. They realise they\u2019re not booking an adult-only flight, especially if going to a family destination. Parents can get more worked up than anyone, but most people have noise-cancelling earphones.\u201d instagram.com/wondercare_irl", "summary": "Take the stress out of navigating airports and flights with our top ten tried-and-tested tips\u00a0", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/parenting/arid-41418124.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8332/4166068_1_seoimage1x1_iStock-519473366_1_.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:00:00", "author": "Helen O'callaghan,Irishexaminer.com", "authors": ["Helen O'callaghan", "Irishexaminer.com"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.295}

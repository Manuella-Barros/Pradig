For a second, it looked like Iggy Azalea was about to enter the fray and square up against SZA. It turned out the whole thing was just a misunderstanding, though, as Azalea explained. On May 27, Azalea tweeted, \u201cWho\u2019s solana\u2026? I don\u2019t know that b*tch.\u201d SZA\u2019s full legal name is Sol\u00e1na Imani Rowe, so some thought Azalea was dissing SZA. But, in response to a user who wrote, \u201cThat\u2019s @sza mother,\u201d Azalea replied, \u201cGirl im talking about crypto.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd I love sza too! not about to have Stan Twitter rope her into crypto sh*t hahaha lmaooo.\u201d As for what Azalea was talking about: Solana is a blockchain platform and the name of its native cryptocurrency, SOL. Meanwhile, SZA recently vented about how she\u2019s perceived, saying, \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m defined as an R&B artist is because I\u2019m Black. It\u2019s almost a little reductive because it doesn\u2019t allow space to be anything else or try anything else. Justin Bieber is not considered an R&B artist; he is a pop artist who makes R&B, folk music, or whatever his heart desires. I simply just want to be allowed the same opportunity to make whatever I want without a label, [without it being] based on the color of my skin, or the crew that I run with, or the beats that I choose. I want \u2018F2F\u2019 to be seen as what it is. I want \u2018Nobody Gets Me\u2019 to be seen as what it is. I want \u2018Kill Bill\u2019 to be seen as what it is.\u201d", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"970\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?w=970&amp;h=400&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"iggy-azalea.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg 970w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?resize=300,124 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?resize=704,290 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?resize=768,317 768w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?resize=852,351 852w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?resize=720,297 720w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea.jpg?resize=420,173 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Gett", "url": "https://uproxx.com/music/iggy-azalea-diss-sza-cryptocurrency-solana/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/iggy-azalea-jpg-12.jpeg?w=650", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:13:48", "author": "Derrick Rossignol", "authors": ["Derrick Rossignol"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.572}

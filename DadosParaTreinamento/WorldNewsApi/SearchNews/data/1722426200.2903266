In an unprecedented and scathing op-ed, The New York Times said Mr. Biden appeared on the debate stage against former President Donald Trump as \u201cthe shadow of a great public servant.\u201d \u201cHe struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence,\u201d the typically left-leaning editorial board wrote. The editorial came less than 24 hours after a disastrous debate performance in which Mr. Biden struggled to complete his thoughts, had little energy and gave rambling, meandering answers. Since the widely criticized debate performance, only a handful of Biden backers have publicly urged the president to step aside as nominee. However, those calls increased Friday afternoon and into the early evening. The editorial board praised Mr. Biden\u2019s leadership and accomplishments in the Oval Office. Still, it said his continued candidacy is a \u201creckless gamble\u201d that \u201crisks the stability and security of the country.\u201d \u201cTo make a call for a new Democratic nominee this late in a campaign is a decision not taken lightly, but it reflects the scale and seriousness of Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge to the values and institutions of this country and the inadequacy of Mr. Biden to confront him,\u201d the op-ed said. The board said concerns about Mr.Biden\u2019s cognitive abilities cannot be dismissed as one bad night or blamed on a cold because questions about his mental acuity have been piling up for months and years. The Times said other public appearances cannot outweigh last night\u2019s performance because they are so tightly controlled by Mr. Biden\u2019s handlers. Compounding the situation, the Times said, is that the Biden campaign challenged Mr. Trump to the debate and insisted on the rules. \u201cHe understood that he needed to address longstanding public concerns about his mental acuity and that he needed to do so as soon as possible,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cThe truth Mr. Biden needs to confront now is that he failed his own test.\u201d The paper called on Democrats to start speaking \u201cplain truths\u201d about Mr. Biden\u2019s future as the nominee, saying it is the best chance to protect the nation from Mr. Trump. \u201cThe clearest path for Democrats to defeat a candidate defined by his lies is to deal truthfully with the American public: acknowledge that Mr. Biden can\u2019t continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place to defeat Mr. Trump in November,\u201d the board wrote.", "summary": "The New York Times editorial board called on President Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee, saying it is the \"greatest public service\" he can perform, but added that it will endorse him if he remains the nominee.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/new-york-times-editorial-board-calls-joe-biden-lea/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/28/Election_2024_Biden_51593.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:14:25", "author": "Jeff Mordock", "authors": ["Jeff Mordock"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.055}

{"id": 237072996, "title": "Sturgeon may be ITV's election night pundit, but all I want to see is her face when she realises her...", "text": "A general election is a slog at the best of times and totally knackering when it\u2019s not going your way. It\u2019s not easy when you\u2019ve got to keep going but you sense the public has switched off. Of all the elections I can remember, this campaign is particularly brutal viewing. It\u2019s missing the hope, inspiration and positivity that political parties need to put forward. I completely understand why so many people are sick fed up of politicians and just want this whole thing to be over already. The only thing the whole country can probably agree on is we\u2019ve all got summer holidays to get on with and enjoy, as soon as this lot get off our screens. But I\u2019m writing today because I want to make sure you know it\u2019s still so important that you do use your vote wisely. There are still several weeks left to run in this campaign but in the coming days, postal ballots will be landing and you\u2019ll get to have your say about the issues that are most important to you. For some of you, that will be education and the future opportunities available to your kids and grandkids. For others, it will be the frustratingly long waiting times for a GP appointment or the shocking lack of resources that fantastic frontline NHS staff need to cope with. Your thoughts could be all about who is best to fix local roads, create good local jobs, or maybe something specific to your local area. Our economy and public services are struggling so much that any number of vital issues could matter most to you. But if the SNP win, none of your top priorities will get a look in. Nationalist MPs won\u2019t be focused on the issues that really matter to you. We all know what they\u2019ll obsess about \u2013 independence above everything else. That\u2019s why your vote is needed to stop the SNP winning. When I went toe-to-toe with Nicola Sturgeon at the 2016 elections, it was to stop the SNP from breaking up the United Kingdom, and I know that thousands of people across Scotland voted for me and my party for that reason. Now, the better part of a decade later, the SNP are still at it. They\u2019re still pushing for the powers to take Scotland out of the UK, while all the time overlooking the important issues that people really want to see time spent on \u2013 growing our economy, getting a grip on NHS waiting lists, driving up educational standards and making our communities safer. John Swinney has said it himself. He has said independence will be \u2018page one, line one\u2019 of the SNP manifesto. That\u2019s what he wants this election to be all about. He\u2019s stated plainly that he will claim every seat the SNP wins as a \u2018mandate\u2019 to deliver independence. The SNP have been a disaster for Scotland, and it will only get worse unless we all act to stop them. Every seat the SNP win would be trumpeted by them as another milestone on the road to independence. We can\u2019t afford to let that happen. We simply can\u2019t allow the SNP to drag attention away from all the issues that really matter. Let\u2019s be honest, I know a lot of people are unhappy at the state of politics not just in Scotland but across the UK as a whole \u2013 and frankly I\u2019m one of them. But you need to ask yourself, how would any of that be helped by electing more SNP MPs? The fact is, this is what the election is about in Scotland. It\u2019s about whether the SNP win or not, and more Nationalist MPs would only make things worse, not better. And be in no doubt the SNP could still win in key seats up and down the country. Many people think it can\u2019t happen, but that\u2019s just plain wrong. The danger is very real. The SNP are down, but they\u2019re not out. We know for a fact that their national HQ in Edinburgh is pouring money and resources into seats from the Borders to the North East where it\u2019s a straight fight between the Scottish Conservatives and the SNP. You can be sure that many nationalist voters will be convinced at the last minute to go out and vote by a rallying cry for independence from John Swinney. That could be enough to just scrape over the line and get enough votes to win many seats. So, to stop that from happening there\u2019s only one thing to be done. Only a vote for the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party in key seats across Scotland can stop the election of an SNP candidate. I know some people might be tempted this time to vote for other parties \u2013 or perhaps not to vote at all. Please don\u2019t because the stakes are just too high. Your vote is a powerful thing. It really can change the course of a whole country \u2013 and not using it can do the same thing. If pro-UK voters don\u2019t use their postal ballot or sit at home, then nationalists who go to the polls will win. And if pro-UK votes are wasted on parties that just can\u2019t win here \u2013 like the Reform Party \u2013 it\u2019s those who want to see the UK broken up who will be celebrating on July 5. This election is a huge opportunity for pro-UK voters. It is the chance we have been waiting for over the past decade. We can finally get rid of the SNP in seats up and down Scotland. We can end their demands for independence \u2013 for good. We can finally move Scotland forward and get away from the divisive independence debate, once and for all. The SNP are adamant July 4 will be their \u2018independence day\u2019. But you can make it the day Scotland is free of the SNP. That\u2019s the prize on offer if you vote Scottish Conservative in key seats. Just think for a moment what could happen if it goes the other way. On the night of the election, Nicola Sturgeon has already agreed to be on your TV screens as a commentator and panelist. Can you imagine how infuriating it will be if we have to watch her celebrate SNP victories? How quickly do you think she would turn those wins into a debate about independence and a demand for the SNP to get their way? I don\u2019t want to give her that satisfaction. I want to switch on the telly that night and see her face as she realises her push for independence is finished. So this is a personal appeal to please use your vote to beat the SNP. Don\u2019t leave your postal ballot on the kitchen worktop and forget about it. Don\u2019t throw it away because you\u2019re sick of all politicians. Don\u2019t let this chance pass us by. The opportunity in Scotland to move on from the SNP is too good to miss. Stopping an SNP win in key seats up and down Scotland really does need your vote for the Scottish Conservatives. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "summary": "A general election is a slog at the best of times and totally knackering when it's not going your way.

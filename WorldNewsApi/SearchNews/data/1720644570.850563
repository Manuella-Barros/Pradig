At least 1.2 million displaced Palestinians were estimated by aid agencies and NGOs to be sheltering in Rafah prior to Israel\u2019s assault on the city on May 6, having fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza. A total of 1.7 million people are displaced across the Gaza Strip, with families that have already been displaced several times on the move again due to \u201cmilitary operations and Israeli evacuation orders,\u201d according to UNRWA. As Israel continues its incursion into Rafah, Israel launched a new military operation in central Gaza earlier this week. Dozens were killed just days ago by a strike on a school run by UNRWA in Nuseirat in central Gaza. An estimated 6,000 people had been sheltering there.", "summary": "<p>Nearly all internally displaced persons have left Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, according to the United Nations\u2019 agency for Palestinian refugees.

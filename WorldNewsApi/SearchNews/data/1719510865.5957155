{"id": 223692792, "title": "Bizarre moment Mike Tindall stops golf tournament to recreate famous Adam Sandler scene", "text": "Mike Tindall loves a joke and couldn\u2019t resist doing a cheeky Adam Sandler impression as he played a round of charity golf over the weekend. The 45-year-old royal, who is married to King Charles\u2019 niece Zara Tindall, hilariously recreated the scene from Happy Gilmore where Sandler\u2019s character had some words of encouragement to make his golf ball go in the hole. Crouching down to the floor, like hot tempered Sandler does in the 1996 hit movie when he misses an all-important shot, Mike put on an American accent as he said: \u201cGet in your hole! What\u2019s the matter with you? You too good for your hole? Kiss my white a** ball!\u201d He captioned the video post: \u201cIf @adamsandler is unavailable for Happy Gilmore 2 then...\u201d Quickly raking up thousands of likes, fans responded with laughing face emojis and commented underneath, with one calling Mike a \u201clegend\u201d. Another said: \u201cLove Mike, such a great guy.\u201d A third wrote of his accent in the clip: \u201cI\u2019m hearing a great Trump impersonation.\u201d The event at the Belfry hotel and Resort in Sutton Coldfield was to raise money for Parkinson\u2019s and was also attended by Mike\u2019s wife Zara Tindall and Cold Feet actor James Nesbitt. All wore pink T-shirts for the charity event \u2013 but Mike went the whole hog and donned matching pink golf trousers too. Known for being one of the most fun-loving royals, Mike\u2019s latest antics come after he lifted the lid on wife Zara\u2019s recent 43rd birthday celebrations earlier this month. Appearing on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain to talk about his charity event, Mike Tindall Celebrity Golf Classic, he revealed a few details about the low-key bash. He shared she had a \"lovely day,\" starting with Zara, an accomplished equestrian, going for a \"ride in the morning.\" The ex-England rugby captain added: \"Then we went out for lunch and then we just hung out all day and had a few friends over in the evening for dinner. It was a very, very nice day.\u201d \u201cProbably why I had a quieter night last night - because I might have had a few the night before,\" he quipped, before making a joke about his wife\u2019s age. He said: \u201cShe keeps telling me she was 34, so I think you got the numbers wrong!\" Mike and Zara, who is Princess Anne\u2019s daughter, have been married since 2011 and share three children, daughters Mia, 10, and Lena, who turns six in June, and three-year-old son Lucas. The couple first met at a bar in Sydney during the 2003 Rugby World Car and were introduced by Zara\u2019s cousin, Prince Harry. During his time in the I'm a Celebrity jungle, Mike opened up about dating Zara, confirming the pair were friends before they started seeing each other. He shared: \"We were friends first and then William and Harry were massive England fans at the time, so we'd met them numerous times. Met more of the family than you'd normally have met of the woman you start dating.\" He continued: \"First actual date, just went out for lunch locally. And ended up being quite a boozy one. Then we figured out that we both quite like getting smashed. It was a good start.\" Both are known for their love of sports, shared sense of humour and relaxed attitude to royal life and since Harry and Meghan quit the UK, they have played a bigger role in the Royal Family at events and public apperances.

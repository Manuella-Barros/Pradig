It's a very young part of me, the 8-to-15-year-old me but made into a boy-man, basically.\"\n\nDarren attends every city council meeting and makes presentations,frustrating city officials. Pine said he could relate to Darren's passion for Los Angeles.\n\n\"I love all the architectural history of my city,\" Pine said. \"I hate it when we tear stuff down.\"\n\nAfter a 20-year career on screen, including franchises Star Trek, Wonder WomanandDungeons & Dragons, Pine said he never dreamed of directing, and that he ended up spearheading Poolman unwittingly.\n\n\"This kind of came out of nowhere,\" Pine said. \"I had this idea for the film. Then I tried to find a writer, couldn't find one, ended up writing it.\"\n\nCo-writing with Ian Gotler, Pine said he followed Darren down any creative path that amused him or what Pine called \"following the giggle.\n\n\" I just followed whatever delighted me and this character delighted me,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the giggle, Pine said, the mystery itself was \"not so important.\" Darren ends up uncovering a conspiracy about the city water supply, which then pays homage to Chinatown, which dealt with water rights in southern California.\n\n\"I like to say, 'Come for the story, stay for the characters,'\" Pine said. \"The movie is a vibe. It's a wavelength. You kind of get on board with it or you don't.\"\n\nWhile writing with Gotler, Pine said, he began to imagine visuals for the film. Once he had a vision for Poolman, he said it became inevitable that he would direct it.\n\nPine said he asked directors for whom he had acted for advice but remained flexible on set.\n\n\"The basic thing was to come prepared, which I tried to do,\" Pine said.\n\nThat preparation included making shot lists for every scene and adapting them once on location.\n\n\"You've shot the film in your head, at least hypothetically in an ideal world,\" Pine said. \"Once you have that record, you already have a template of what you want to do, and from there, you can tweak and change.\"\n\nFilming in Los Angeles required such adaptation. As much as Pine wanted to highlight L.A. locations like the abandoned Topanga Ranch Motel, budget constraints required consolidation.\n\nThe Biltmore Hotel doubled for several locations, and Pine was able to film at the Santa Anita Racetrack and Clifton's Cafeteria. He said he wanted to include both the dilapidated and glamorous sides of Los Angeles.\n\n\"I wanted to be kind of not cool,\" Pine said. \"Then I also wanted to show the great grandeur of the old Hollywood, like the Biltmore.\"\n\nPine said his directorial style took on Darren's attitude because no time was available to compartmentalize his acting and directing. This kept the energy high on set.\n\n\"I'm the emcee of an event that's slowly dipping further and further into the dark, murky waters of oblivion,\" Pine said. \"So, I'm like a court jester.\"\n\nNow that he has directed a movie, Pine said he will be even more considerate toward his directors and crew when he is only acting. He said he would even think twice before disparaging a movie.\n\n\"When I remember how hard people work to make a film, how difficult it is to make a film, how long it takes to make a film, it's a miracle that any independent film gets made,\" Pine said. \"The fact that people do this for a living is really incredible.\"\n\nWhen Pine returns to the franchise worlds, he said, he is unsure whether a fourth Star Trek will happen. There have been stops and starts, including possibilities with Quentin Tarantino and Noah Hawley.\n\nPine said the potential sale of Paramount Global, the studio behind the Star Trek franchise, could affect its films.\n\n\"I'd certainly like to do it again, but I don't have any new information to impart,\" Pine said. \"The Quentin Tarantino film obviously sounded really interesting but who knows?\"", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_topel@bradenton.com", "name": "Fred Topel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poolman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Biltmore_Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennium Biltmore Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinatown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton's_Cafeteria", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clifton's Cafeteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classical Hollywood cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_ceremonies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master of ceremonies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quentin Tarantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topanga,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Topanga, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Topanga, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/cw351f/picture288429733/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/7d3ed550-e8fa-4364-9f7b-94f7ad5490c3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552716", "eventUri": "eng-9552716", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Negative reviews of Pine's directorial debut reminded him of the joy of acting. Despite disappointing reviews for Poolman , Chris Pine remains positive and determined to focus on the joy of filmmaking.\n\nChris Pine has been incredibly candid and honest in his response to the negative reviews for Poolman, which Pine directed and starred in. The film is Chris Pine's directorial debut, and tells the story of an optimistic pool cleaner in L.A who becomes embroiled in an investigation into a shady company. The film made its debut at the Toronto Film Festival in 2023, and received less than stellar reviews from critics following the screening - currently sitting at 21% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nChris Pine recently appeared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast with Josh Horowitz to promote the film's theatrical release, and gave a very open response to the critics' opinions. The actor started by saying that \"criticism... it's just a part of the game,\" but said that receiving criticism as an actor is a lot easier than as a director. Pine said:\n\n\"There's a lot of stuff to hide behind. There's the director, and there's the writer, and it's the release pattern. And as an actor, you get to come on set, you do your dance, and then you go off and by the time the film comes out, you've done x amount of other projects.\"\n\nPoolman (2023) ComedyMystery Release Date May 10, 2024 Director Chris Pine Cast Chris Pine , Annette Bening , Danny DeVito , Jennifer Jason Leigh , DeWanda Wise Runtime 1h 40m Main Genre Comedy Writers Chris Pine , Ian Gotler Studio(s) AGC Studios , Barry Linen Motion Pictures , Shiny Penny Productions , Wicious Pictures Distributor(s) Vertical Entertainment\n\nChris Pine likened receiving criticism as a director to being a stand-up comedian, and \"standing on stage and feeling utterly naked.\" Pine did admit that he wasn't completely shocked at how much the critics disliked his movie. The actor said:\n\n\"When the film came out at Toronto and just got f*cking panned. I guess I wasn't totally surprised. I tried to make a joyful film... I was not trying to make some sort of Niche film. But [there] was so much joy behind it, to them be met with this fuselage of not so joyous stuff was like, 'Oh my God!' So the cognitive dissonance there was quite something.\"\n\nPoolman's Negative Reviews Reminded Chris Pine Why He Loves Acting\n\nAfter writing, directing, casting, shooting, and starring in a passion project movie, only for it to be met with overwhelmingly negative reviews, most people would collapse in on themselves... but not Chris Pine. During the interview, the actor said that the negative reviews actually reminded him why he loved his job so much. Pine said:\n\n\"It's been really, ultimately, kind of the best thing that's ever happened to me, because it's forced me to double down on joy. And really double down on what I love most about my job. Which you kind of forget as an actor sometimes. Which is, fundamentally, it's about play, right? What you do is essentially become children for hours a day and make believe. There's an impish quality to it that I don't ever want to lose.\"\n\nRelated Chris Pine Left a Little Confused Over Star Trek 4 Development: 'I Guess I Was Wrong' Chris Pine has been discussing the long-awaited arrival of Star Trek 4...\n\nChris Pine co-wrote Poolman with Ian Gotler (Ad Lucem) and assembled a phenomenal cast for the film.

In a conversation with Deadline, producer Stacey Sher spoke about the movie, saying:\n\n\"Poolman is wildly optimistic, wear-its-heart-on-its-sleeve-but-for-the-better sort of way type of movie.

This could be the tagline for Chris Pine's Poolman, a film that so deeply misunderstands what normal people like about the movies that it could have only come from someone who's never done anything else.\n\nIf you clicked on this Poolman review, there's a good chance it was out of morbid curiosity rather than any genuine, honest desire to sit through the excruciating 100 minutes of this movie. If not, here's a quick catch-up: Pine debuted his attempt at a neo-noir satire at TIFF last fall, and the reviews were nothing short of abysmal. There were apparently numerous walkouts, and multiple mainstream outlets said it was not only the worst film of that festival season, but that it would probably be the worst film in any festival season in which it was released. Definitely not what you want to hear about your baby that was \"born from a giggle, made with the softest of puppy Labrador licks to the face, and presented with a giant hug of compassion,\" as Pine described the film at a recent screening in New York City.\n\nWe honestly feel kinda bad for the guy, so here's another way to look at it: If you're a cultural anthropologist, a psychiatrist to the stars looking to understand a little bit more about what the hell goes on in A-listers' brains, or even just a regular old hater looking to engage in a little bit of schadenfreude, Poolman might be a valuable research tool for you. On a meta level, it's genuinely kind of fascinating to reckon with the fact that sometimes, the stars aren't just like us. On just about every other level, though, Poolman sinks long before it gives itself the chance to swim.\n\nPoolman reads kind of like an episode of Community if Abed didn't actually understand any of the movies he referenced. Pine stars as Darren Barrenman (get it? \"Barren Man\"?), a \"long-haired manchild\" who talks and dresses like a fifth grader and writes daily letters to Erin Brockovich (not Julia Roberts) on his typewriter. He cleans the pool at his shabby L.A. apartment complex (but literally only that one pool), engages in extremely awkward and painfully long post-coital banter with his girlfriend Susan (Jennifer Jason Leigh), crashes city council meetings to complain about the transportation options, and does it all over again the next day.\n\nThat is, until a mysterious femme fatale figure (DeWanda Wise, trying really hard to make this all work) shows up to alert Darren to a vague governmental conspiracy involving the city council official he's been bothering for months (Stephen Tobolowsky), an incoming real estate development, and something about the city's water. Pine and Ian Gotler's script isn't remotely concerned with the details, and you shouldn't be either. The only thing that matters is that it's just like Chinatown, a reference the movie bashes over its audience's heads so frequently that one might start to wonder if Paramount, Chinatown's distributor, inked some sort of bizarre product placement deal with Poolman's producers.\n\nEven though that obviously isn't what happened, the free advertising is still coming directly out of Poolman's pockets. The movie makes its terminal blunder somewhere in its first half hour, when it actually puts a clip of the Roman Polanski film on screen. From there, it's hard to spend any of the next 100 minutes of origami, egg cream, and almond-centric bits (there are multiple instances of each) wishing for anything other than to be watching a real movie. Best Original Screenplay this is not.\n\nIt's a shame, because there are definitely a few seeds of something workable here. The entire supporting cast -- including Danny DeVito (playing an out-of-work filmmaker) and Annette Bening (a \"Jungian therapist\") who serve as Darren's surrogate parent figures -- commit hard to their roles. There's a fun cameo from Ray Wise, and there were some scattered moments that elicit real laughs. In one, Darren has a brief moment of something resembling actual characterization as he reacts to his best friend's (John Ortiz) betrayal. Later, he cracks a genuinely funny joke about watching Bren\u00e9 Brown.\n\nBut these disparate giggles can't make up for the fact that this movie was clearly made by Chris Pine, for Chris Pine. It's not even really so much a movie, as a collection of things Chris Pine finds funny and interesting without even a whisper of a cohesive narrative to tie any of them together. In his talkback, for example, the actor-director explained that Tobolowsky's character doubles as an Orthodox rabbi because he trained as one in real life, and the two actors once had a conversation about the Talmud. None of that is explained in the actual film, of course. The councilman is just randomly also a rabbi. The same is true for all those L.A. references, which are largely to things Pine \"find[s] very personally important as an aesthete.\" Hanna-Barbera makes an appearance because Pine found the studios beautiful as a kid. The story is the same for the long-ago demolished Garden of Allah hotel in West Hollywood. \"This is a really dense film and I was told many times to cut it. I was like, 'I just don't want to cut it,'\" he said. \"I just find it very funny.\" That much is clear.\n\nIf you're a Chris Pine super-fan looking to live inside the actor's head for a little while, Poolman just might be for you. But if you're pretty much anyone else -- even someone looking for some so-bad-it's-good fun -- take a lesson from the walkouts and stay out of the splash zone.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

That really is the whys and wherefores and the feel and the vibe of the texture of the film.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poolman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wonder Woman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny DeVito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Bening", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annette Bening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buster Keaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWanda_Wise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeWanda Wise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jason_Leigh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Jason Leigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinatown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14776021_050624-kabc-4p-geo-poolman-vid.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552716", "eventUri": "eng-9552716", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

It's a very young part of me, the 8-to-15-year-old me but made into a boy-man, basically.\"\n\nDarren attends every city council meeting and makes presentations,frustrating city officials. Pine said he could relate to Darren's passion for Los Angeles.\n\n\"I love all the architectural history of my city,\" Pine said. \"I hate it when we tear stuff down.\"\n\nAfter a 20-year career on screen, including franchises Star Trek, Wonder Woman and Dungeons & Dragons, Pine said he never dreamed of directing, and that he ended up spearheading Poolman unwittingly.\n\n\"This kind of came out of nowhere,\" Pine said. \"I had this idea for the film. Then I tried to find a writer, couldn't find one, ended up writing it.\"\n\nCo-writing with Ian Gotler, Pine said he followed Darren down any creative path that amused him or what Pine called \"following the giggle.\n\n\" I just followed whatever delighted me and this character delighted me,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the giggle, Pine said, the mystery itself was \"not so important.\" Darren ends up uncovering a conspiracy about the city water supply, which then pays homage to Chinatown, which dealt with water rights in southern California.\n\n\"I like to say, 'Come for the story, stay for the characters,'\" Pine said. \"The movie is a vibe. It's a wavelength. You kind of get on board with it or you don't.\"\n\nWhile writing with Gotler, Pine said, he began to imagine visuals for the film. Once he had a vision for Poolman, he said it became inevitable that he would direct it.\n\nPine said he asked directors for whom he had acted for advice but remained flexible on set.\n\n\"The basic thing was to come prepared, which I tried to do,\" Pine said.\n\nThat preparation included making shot lists for every scene and adapting them once on location.\n\n\"You've shot the film in your head, at least hypothetically in an ideal world,\" Pine said. \"Once you have that record, you already have a template of what you want to do, and from there, you can tweak and change.\"\n\nFilming in Los Angeles required such adaptation. As much as Pine wanted to highlight L.A. locations like the abandoned Topanga Ranch Motel, budget constraints required consolidation.\n\nThe Biltmore Hotel doubled for several locations, and Pine was able to film at the Santa Anita Racetrack and Clifton's Cafeteria. He said he wanted to include both the dilapidated and glamorous sides of Los Angeles.\n\n\"I wanted to be kind of not cool,\" Pine said. \"Then I also wanted to show the great grandeur of the old Hollywood, like the Biltmore.\"\n\nPine said his directorial style took on Darren's attitude because no time was available to compartmentalize his acting and directing. This kept the energy high on set.\n\n\"I'm the emcee of an event that's slowly dipping further and further into the dark, murky waters of oblivion,\" Pine said. \"So, I'm like a court jester.\"\n\nNow that he has directed a movie, Pine said he will be even more considerate toward his directors and crew when he is only acting. He said he would even think twice before disparaging a movie.\n\n\"When I remember how hard people work to make a film, how difficult it is to make a film, how long it takes to make a film, it's a miracle that any independent film gets made,\" Pine said. \"The fact that people do this for a living is really incredible.\"\n\nWhen Pine returns to the franchise worlds, he said, he is unsure whether a fourth Star Trek will happen. There have been stops and starts, including possibilities with Quentin Tarantino and Noah Hawley.\n\nPine said the potential sale of Paramount Global, the studio behind the Star Trek franchise, could affect its films.\n\n\"I'd certainly like to do it again, but I don't have any new information to impart,\" Pine said. \"The Quentin Tarantino film obviously sounded really interesting but who knows?\"", "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wonder Woman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Biltmore_Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennium Biltmore Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinatown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton's_Cafeteria", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clifton's Cafeteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classical Hollywood cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_ceremonies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master of ceremonies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quentin Tarantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topanga,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Topanga, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Topanga, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9771715196092/2024/i/17151967231476/v2.1/Chris-Pine-Poolman-character-is-the-awkward-side-of-me.jpg?lg=4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552716", "eventUri": "eng-9552716", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

While the Don't Worry Darling actor said he's starting to dip his toe in the directorial pool, he's not saying goodbye to acting anytime soon.\n\n\"I'm an actor first and foremost,\" Pine told Yahoo Entertainment. \"I don't think I'll ever give that up.\"\n\nAfter all, the actor-director knows more than a little about the industry itself. He's the son of actor Robert Pine (CHiPs) and actress Gwynne Gilford (Masters of the Universe), and even discussed his \"nepo baby\" status recently with podcaster Marc Maron. That said, DeVito was quick to champion Pine's dedication to the project.\n\n\"I've worked with Milos Forman, I've worked with a lot of people that were all engulfed in the story. This is the way he works,\" said DeVito, who also confirmed to Yahoo Entertainment that he's working on an upcoming project with his Twins co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\"We are in the middle of the process,\" DeVito said. \"It's being written, and well, hopefully next year when he's done with his [TV series] Fubar.\"\n\n\"But, you know, every movie takes a long time,\" he added. \"Arnold and I are very eager to work together, and we're gonna do it next year.\"\n\nPoolman, which also counts Annette Bening, Jennifer Jason Leigh and DeWanda Wise among the cast, takes some of its inspiration from the L.A. film noir Chinatown, which stars Jack Nicholson as a detective who also solves a mystery that's more than he bargained for.\n\nPine explained that his inspiration didn't come from the 1974 classic alone, though.\n\n\"I think my film, at least from an aesthetic standpoint, kind of owes some of its existence to my love of '70s cinema,\" he said. \"There's some screwball comedy, like What's Up, Doc? There's a little bit of, I hope, [Hal] Ashby in there, a little bit of Being There. That was a big touchstone for me.\"\n\nHis Girl Friday and \"a little bit of Buster Keaton\" influenced the first-time director as well.\n\nPine said he enjoyed the seemingly constant motion of filmmaking.\n\n\"Film is a lot about waiting, so I like 12 hours a day of just kind of moving, hustling, working,\" he explained. \"That made me feel really good, so I definitely want to do it again.\"\n\nFor DeVito, who also starred in L.A. Confidential, working with a director who also understood the perspective of someone in front of the camera was key.\n\n\"I always say that a really good director has to understand what the actor is going through,\" DeVito said, \"and I think, big-time, Chris knows that.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poolman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Danny DeVito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwball_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screwball comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wonder Woman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Worry_Darling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don't Worry Darling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynne_Gilford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gwynne Gilford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Maron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Maron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo\u0161_Forman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milo\u0161 Forman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHiPs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CHiPs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Confidential", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L.A.

The movie is Pine's feature directorial debut, but it got eviscerated by critics when it premiered at last year's Toronto International Film Festival. Variety critic Owen Gleiberman called it an \"absurdist disaster,\" for instance.\n\nMaking the press rounds to support the \"Poolman\" theatrical release, Pine stopped by the \"Happy Sad Confused\" podcast and refused to believe that he made a complete dud of a movie.\n\n\"Criticism as an actor is just a part of the game, but there's a lot of stuff to hide behind,\" Pine said. \"There's the director and the writer and the release pattern, etc. As an actor you come on set and you do your dance and you go off and by the time the film comes out you've done X amount of other projects. The closest thing I would imagine this is like -- co-writing, directing, and starring in -- is a stand-up comedian on stage feeling utterly naked. It's been a real come-to-Jesus moment to seeing how resilient I am.\"\n\n\"When the film came out at Toronto and just got fucking panned...I tried to make a joyful film,\" Pine continued. \"With so much joy behind it, to then be met with a fusillade of not-so-joyous stuff...the cognitive dissonance there was quite something. It's ultimately been the best thing that's ever happened to me. It's forced me to double down on joy and really double down on what I love most about my job, which you kind of forget, it's fundamentally about play. You become children for hours a day and make believe. There's an impish quality that I don't want to lose.\"\n\nPine said that he has been talking to his therapist about how he wishes he could be impervious to negative reviews, but he stressed: \"I fully own the deep hurt of that process.\"\n\n\"In the reframing of it...one of my favorite quotes is in Latin and it's 'vigor grows from the wound,'\" Pine said. \"In everything that feels like a setback, yes there is the hurt of the cut, but as the scar tissue forms and the healing process happens you do benefit from a growth in resilience.\"\n\n\"I watched my film. After the reviews in Toronto I was like maybe I did make a pile of shit,\" the actor admitted. \"I went back and watched it. I fucking love this film. I love this film so much.\"\n\n\"Poolman\" stars Pine opposite Annette Bening, DeWanda Wise, Stephen Tobolowsky, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Danny DeVito and more.

Making his directorial debut, Pine also stars as Darren Barrenman, a Los Angeles-based pool cleaner.Chris Pine enters into the realm of directing with his latest project, \"Poolman,\" a comedy-mystery film hitting theaters this week. In his directorial debut, Pine portrays Darren Barrenman, a Los Angeles-based pool cleaner embroiled in a quest for truth spurred by a mysterious woman.\n\nAlongside Pine, the star-studded cast features Annette Bening, Danny DeVito, and DeWanda Wise, promising a captivating cinematic experience.\n\nFor eager viewers wondering where to catch \"Poolman,\" the current avenue is a trip to the nearest movie theater upon its release on Friday, May 10. Local screenings can be conveniently located via Fandango.\n\nAlternatively, fans can anticipate its availability for rental or purchase on popular digital platforms such as Vudu, Apple, YouTube, and Amazon, although the precise timeline for digital release remains undisclosed, as mentioned in a report by Decider.\n\nAs anticipation mounts, inquiries arise regarding the film's streaming prospects. While an official release date for Prime Video remains elusive, industry trends suggest that \"Poolman\" could make its digital debut approximately 45 days post-theatrical release. Should this pattern hold, viewers may anticipate the film's arrival on Prime Video by late June 2024, offering an accessible viewing option from the comfort of home.\n\nAmidst speculations about streaming platforms, it's pertinent to note that \"Poolman\" will not grace the libraries of HBO Max or Netflix. The absence from HBO Max is attributed to its non-alignment with Warner Bros. Discovery's catalog, delineating it from the streaming giant's offerings.\n\nSimilarly, Netflix enthusiasts will have to exercise patience, as there are no imminent plans for \"Poolman\" to debut on the platform. While future streaming possibilities remain plausible, for now, enthusiasts must await theatrical screenings or digital releases for their \"Poolman\" fix.\n\nAs audiences eagerly anticipate Chris Pine's directorial venture, \"Poolman\" promises an intriguing blend of comedy and mystery, enriched by a stellar ensemble cast. With theatrical screenings beckoning and digital avenues on the horizon, viewers can brace themselves for an immersive cinematic experience that navigates the enigmatic depths of Darren Barrenman's world.\n\nHas Poolman been released?\n\nPoolman is set to hit theaters on May 10, 2024. Coincidentally, this date also sees the US release of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and arrives just a week before the US release of John Krasinski's IF.\n\nWhere was Poolman filmed?\n\nPine conceived the film idea while chatting with director Patty Jenkins, who will be one of the producers. In May, Ariana DeBose and Jennifer Jason Leigh joined the cast, with Matthew Jensen onboard as the cinematographer. DeWanda Wise was later added to the cast in July. Filming commenced in June 2022 in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poolman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Bening", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annette Bening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny DeVito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandango_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fandango Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWanda_Wise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeWanda Wise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Out in theaters on May 10, 2024, the comedy movie also stars Annette Bening, Jennifer Jason Leigh, DeWanda Wise, Stephen Tobolowsky, Clancy Brown, John Ortiz, and Ray Wise.\n\n\"Poolman tells the story of Darren Barrenman (Chris Pine), a native Los Angeleno who spends his days looking after the pool of the Tahitian Tiki apartment block and fighting to make his hometown a better place to live,\" says the synopsis for the Vertical release. \"When he is tasked by a femme fatale to uncover the truth behind a shady business deal, Darren enlists the help of his friends to take on a corrupt politician and a greedy land developer. His investigation reveals a hidden truth about his beloved city and himself.\"\n\nTyler Treese: Chris, you have shown such great range lately, especially the D&D movie. You got to show every bit of you and fans love you for these blockbusters and these action movies. So what's been most rewarding about really getting to show a different side of yourself, especially with Poolman and doing this very offbeat comedy and this like love letter to LA all wrapped up in one?\n\nChris Pine: I think it's just rewarding to do something that is all mine. I co-wrote it with one of my best friends, but everything from the costumes or the colors to the sound or the music, I finally got to make a piece of art that I can say is wholly my own. There wasn't really any conscious decision to show a different side of myself. It's just what I was naturally inclined to do. I feel probably, I feel within myself, probably closer to Darren than I do most other characters I've ever played. So it was super rewarding and fun. The whole thing was about following the giggle and see where it takes you.\n\nDanny, you're not just a great actor, you're also a very talented director yourself. So I was curious if during filming of Poolman, did you and Chris ever talk about directing any? How were those conversations?\n\nDanny DeVito: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We talked from the very beginning when I read the script. I loved it. I thought it was a great character to play from the very first rehearsal when we had to go through all the pandemic and wait for all these things to come together. We were thinking about it for a long time, and from the very first rehearsal, Annette [Bening] and I, with us in the room, all pitching things, talking about motivations and things.\n\nActually, what's great about it was that he was very free as a director to allow the actors to riff off and try things. You never felt any kind of constraints in things, and [he] let us go have a lot of fun with him. I feel like that's what also internally he was going through with the movie from running behind the camera to the front of the camera. So it felt really good. We did talk a lot, yeah.\n\nChris, my favorite scene in Poolman was The Golden Girls reenactment. Just such a fun idea. Are you a big Golden Girls fan? How was that born?\n\nPine: I like The Golden Girls, but my writing partner's a huge Golden Girls buff and had just actually watched the entirety of the series and picked it apart. Like he was writing a PhD on comedy writing. So he was tremendously off book, and we needed a scene that reflected, and I cannot believe he found this Golden Girls episode where Blanche talks about writing Bob Hope as a pen pal to feel less alone. It was like manna from heaven. It was exactly what the film's all about, with me writing Erin Brockovich, and I had seen Golden Girlz perform at Casita del Campo before they moved to their current location. I then ended up performing with Golden Girlz as Burt Reynolds from an episode. They're incredible. They did a great job and came out to play, and we had a great time.\n\nDanny, Death to Smoochy is one of my favorite movies.\n\nDeVito: Thank you so much.\n\nIt's become like a cult classic now. How's it been just seeing that reputation and it find its audience over time?\n\nDeVito: I love it. I had so much fun making that movie. We made it at a certain time where a lot of people didn't get to see it, but now the fan base has grown so much. I love the fact that that's happening, that it's being rediscovered. Robin is great in it. Edward Norton, like off the charts. All the people who contributed to that movie really did a great job. That's a wild and wacky crazy movie. It's dear to my heart, Death to Smoochy.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_treese@comingsoon.net", "name": "Tyler Treese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poolman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Danny DeVito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Bening", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annette Bening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Wise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ray Wise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ortiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Ortiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clancy_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clancy Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWanda_Wise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeWanda Wise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Tobolowsky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Tobolowsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jason_Leigh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Jason Leigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Girls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Golden Girls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femme_fatale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Femme fatale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Brockovich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erin Brockovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burt Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Hope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Poolman.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552716", "eventUri": "eng-9552716", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 173, "textEnd": 179}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

She was attacked on Friday evening as she stepped out of her house.\n\n\"There was a shot to the temple. The shooter was seen by the neighbors, he was wearing gloves and the weapon did not have a silencer,\" local journalist Marta Olyarnik said in a Facebook post.\n\nFarion was rushed to a local hospital. One local Telegram channel reported she was in critical condition, while city councilman Igor Zinkevich described her condition as \"serious.\"\n\nVideo from the scene showed a pool of blood on the street. Local media have described the attacker as a young man in his early twenties. The gunman's identity and whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nFarion has been a member of 'Svoboda' (Freedom), formerly known as the Social-National Party of Ukraine, led by neo-Nazi Oleg Tyagnibok. She has expressed open sympathy for WWII neo-Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera.\n\nWhile in parliament, Farion championed a total ban on the use of Russian language in Ukraine. In January last year, she famously told the media that her grandson Dmitry was hitting Russian-speaking children at his kindergarten. Several months later, she called anyone who lived in Ukraine but did not speak Ukrainian \"biological waste.\"\n\nThis hard line has led her to clash with other nationalists. Last November, Farion said that Russian-speaking members of 'Azov' were not proper Ukrainians, drawing the ire of Maksim Zhorin and Bogdan Krotevich, two veterans of the notorious neo-Nazi unit.\n\nThe Lviv Polytechnic, where Farion was teaching at the time, fired her over the comments. She was reinstated by a court order in May this year.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly condemned Ukrainian laws restricting the use of the Russian language and policies aimed at eroding cultural and historical ties with the neighboring state.

She was attacked on Friday evening as she stepped out of her house.\n\n\"There was a shot to the temple. The shooter was seen by the neighbors, he was wearing gloves and the weapon did not have a silencer,\" local journalist Marta Olyarnik said in a Facebook post.\n\nFarion was rushed to a local hospital. One local Telegram channel reported she was in critical condition, while city councilman Igor Zinkevich described her condition as \"serious.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, however, Lviv Mayor Andrey Sadovoy confirmed that she succumbed to her injuries.\n\n\"Doctors did everything possible, but the injury was incompatible with life,\" Sadovoy said. \"It is very scary and terrible that there is no longer a safe place in Ukraine. But for such a brazen, impudent murder, the killer must be found.\"\n\nVideo from the scene showed a pool of blood on the street. Local media have described the attacker as a young man in his early twenties. The gunman's identity and whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nFarion was a member of 'Svoboda' (Freedom), formerly known as the Social-National Party of Ukraine, led by neo-Nazi Oleg Tyagnibok. She expressed open sympathy for WWII neo-Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera.\n\nWhile in parliament, she championed a total ban on the use of Russian language in Ukraine. In January last year, she famously told the media that her grandson Dmitry was hitting Russian-speaking children at his kindergarten. Several months later, she called anyone who lived in Ukraine but did not speak Ukrainian \"biological waste.\"\n\nThis hard line led her to clash with other nationalists. Last November, Farion said that Russian-speaking members of 'Azov' were not proper Ukrainians, drawing the ire of Maksim Zhorin and Bogdan Krotevich, two veterans of the notorious neo-Nazi unit.\n\nThe Lviv Polytechnic, where Farion was teaching at the time, fired her over the comments. She was reinstated by a court order in May this year.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly condemned Ukrainian laws restricting the use of the Russian language and policies aimed at eroding cultural and historical ties with the neighboring state. President Vladimir Putin has cited \"the de-Russification and forced assimilation\" of Russian speakers - more than a third of Ukraine's population - by Kiev as being one of the causes of the current conflict.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Russian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Russian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultranationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-National_Party_of_Ukraine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social-National Party of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Svoboda (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleh_Tyahnybok", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oleh Tyahnybok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language_in_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language in Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Polytechnic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lviv Polytechnic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Azov", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea of Azov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stepan Bandera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1721424001.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748227", "eventUri": "eng-9748227", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

According to him, the woman was alive, but in serious condition. \"The shooter was seen by neighbors, he was wearing gloves, and the weapon was without a silencer,\" Zinkevich wrote.\n\nLater, the information about the shooting was confirmed by the police, and the attack on Farion was first classified as an attempted murder, and then the crime was reclassified as Part 1 of Article 115 (premeditated murder) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.\n\nLocal journalist Marta Oliyarnik also wrote about the attempted assassination of Farion. \"It is not known for certain whether the shot was fatal, she was taken away by an ambulance. I learned about it from my own sources. It happened at 3 Masaryk Street. She was shot in the temple,\" she said.\n\nAccording to ZAXID.NET, Farion is currently in critical condition in the hospital.\n\n\"Iryna Farion was hospitalized in critical condition in the First Medical Unit of Lviv on Mykolaychuk Street at about 19:40 with a gunshot wound to the head. She is in the emergency department,\" the statement said.\n\nDoctors fought for the woman's life\n\nIn a comment to OBOZ.UA, the First Medical Association of Lviv confirmed that a woman with a gunshot wound was admitted to St. Panteleimon Hospital around 20:00. She is currently in intensive care, her condition is serious.\n\n\"Given the medical secrecy and the need to preserve the personal data of patients, regardless of their publicity, we cannot provide more detailed information,\" they added.\n\nLater, doctors said that Farion was brought to them in a deep brain coma and on artificial lung ventilation. She underwent surgery for the primary treatment of her head wound, and doctors continue to fight for her life, said Natalia Matolinets, head of the anesthesiology service of the First Lviv City Medical Center.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not possible to save Irina Farion. She died in the hospital at 23:20. This was reported by the press service of the First Medical Association of Lviv.\n\n\"An operation was performed, and she was even transferred to the intensive care unit to continue treatment. However, the patient's heart failed,\" the hospital said.\n\nWhat the police say\n\nThe information about the assassination attempt was confirmed by the police, without naming the victim, but our source confirmed that it was Farion. They noted that the incident occurred at about 19:30 on a street in Lviv, where an unknown person fired at the 60-year-old public figure.\n\n\"The woman was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the head. Law enforcement officers are taking measures to detain the shooter. Investigators, operatives, and the leadership of the Lviv regional police are working at the scene,\" law enforcement officials said.\n\nLviv media report that a man aged 20-25 shot at Farion. According to eyewitnesses, the shooter repeatedly followed the woman near the entrance over the past 2-3 weeks.\n\nThe police reported that investigators had registered the shooting of Farion in the Unified Register of Pre-trial Investigations under Part 2 of Article 15, Part 1 of Article 115 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which is attempted premeditated murder. The attacker faces up to 15 years in prison.\n\nInterior Minister Ihor Klymenko also said that Farion's condition is serious, and doctors are fighting for her life.\n\n\"The police and other necessary services are working at the scene of the shooting. They have witness statements and are processing data from CCTV cameras. The crime is being solved in an active phase. I systematically receive reports from the police leadership on the measures taken and the circumstances established,\" he wrote.\n\nLater, when it became known that Farion had died, the crime was reclassified to Part 1 of Article 115 (premeditated murder) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.\n\nReaction of the Ukrainian authorities\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to the assassination attempt: Ihor Klymenko and the head of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Malyuk promptly reported to him on the search for the attacker of Iryna Farion. The Head of State noted that all the necessary forces of the National Police of Ukraine and the Security Service of Ukraine are involved in establishing the circumstances of this crime.\n\n\"Obviously, any violence deserves only condemnation, and everyone who is guilty of this attack must be held fully accountable,\" the guarantor added.\n\nLviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi and the head of the Lviv Regional State Administration Maksym Kozytskyi also called for the arrest and punishment of the attacker.\n\n\"The community of Lviv expresses its sincere condolences to the family and everyone who knew and loved her. This is very scary and terrible. I always say that there is no safe place in Ukraine anymore. But to have such a bold, brazen murder. The killer must be found!\" Sadovyi wrote when it became known about Farion's death.\n\nHe thanked the law enforcement agencies that are actively working to detain the shooter and emphasized that the customer of the murder must also be known and bear full responsibility.\n\n\"It's a shame, but despite all the efforts of the doctors, they failed to save Iryna Farion. My sincere condolences to the family, friends and students of Iryna Dmytrivna,\" wrote Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klychko said that Farion's murder was a provocation and a challenge, and noted that violence is not a method of dealing with opponents and those who think differently.\n\n\"The law enforcement system, democracy and stability in the country. And it should be investigated promptly and openly to the public,\" he wrote.\n\nAs previously reported, in June, Farion announced that she had been officially reinstated as a professor of the Ukrainian language department at Lviv Polytechnic University. Based on the decision of the Lviv Court of Appeal, she is also to be paid almost 124 thousand UAH of salary for the period of forced absenteeism.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine continued to investigate former MP and linguist Iryna Farion. She became a person of interest in the criminal proceedings after she published a message allegedly received from a pro-Ukrainian student from the temporarily occupied Crimea, \"revealing\" his personal data.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iryna_Farion", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iryna Farion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ihor_Klymenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ihor Klymenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Ukraine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Service_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security Service of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasyl_Malyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vasyl Malyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Kyiv", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Kyiv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Police of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Sadovyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Sadovyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_Klitschko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vitali Klitschko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Polytechnic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lviv Polytechnic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/20/znimok-ekrana-2024-07-19-o-20-09-12.png?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748227", "eventUri": "eng-9748227", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 101}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

She was reportedly walking down the street when an unknown assailant shot her in the head.\n\nFarion was rushed to the hospital. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovy announced at 11:30 p.m. that Farion succumbed to her injuries in what he called \"an audacious, brazen murder.\"\n\nAuthorities said the case had been classified as \"intentional murder,\" and investigations are ongoing to identify and apprehend the shooter.\n\nA local Telegram channel reported the suspected shooter to be a man aged 20-25, though Kyiv Post is unable to verify the claims; other reports also claimed that Farion was set to go on vacation with her grandchildren to Bulgaria on Saturday, the authenticity of which Kyiv Post is also unable to verify.\n\nA young man dressed in an attire abnormal for the heat reportedly started sitting outside Farion's building for extended periods two weeks ago. Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko confirmed to media outlets that he is the main suspect.\n\nThe intention of the shooting remains unclear at the time of publication, and Klymenko said authorities are considering multiple versions of events.\n\n\"Of course, other versions may appear. We already have some information about the commission of this crime, about the execution of this crime, but for now we will keep silent about it, because all versions are being checked,\" said Klymenko at an evening briefing.\n\nWho is Iryna Farion?\n\nSixty-year-old Farion was a linguist, former lawmaker and self-styled ultra-nationalist known for her uncompromising stance on the language issue in Ukraine.\n\nShe joined the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party in 2005 and was elected to parliament in 2012. But like her radical party, she failed to maintain popular support and two years later was not elected for a second term. She finished third in her constituency in Lviv with approximately 16% of the vote.\n\nShe nevertheless maintained her strident tone. In 2017, she said in a television interview that those who do not speak Ukrainian should not receive jobs and education.\n\nIn November 2023, Farion sparked anger and mockery when she said that Ukrainian soldiers from the Azov battalion who speak Russian were not \"true patriots.\"\n\n\"If they don't speak Ukrainian, then let them call themselves Russians. Why are they so crazy? If they are such great patriots, show your patriotism,\" she said.\n\nThe statement drew criticism from lawmakers and celebrities alike, including Ukrainian world boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk, a Russian-speaker from Crimea who proudly flaunts his Ukrainian identity in the international arena, posted a poem in Russian that mocked Farion as being \"an agent of the Kremlin.\"\n\nThe scandal sparked further anger when Farion published a letter of support from a student in Russian-occupied Crimea without hiding his name, which led to the student's arrest by Russian authorities.\n\nReports also surfaced at the time of her communist past under former Soviet Ukraine, including awards for her exemplary service in promoting the Russian language to foreigners, though she said she did so only to further her career growth and to \"destroy them from the inside.\"\n\nAs a result, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) initiated criminal proceedings based on Farion's previous statements and publications.\n\nFarion was also dismissed from her teaching position at the Lviv Polytechnic National University following the incident. The Halytskyi District Court of Lviv initially refused her appeal for reinstatement in February. Subsequently, the Lviv Court of Appeal ruled that the university should reinstate her and compensate her with full salary during her dismissal.\n\nThe language issue has generated much debate within the population, a reason why Farion has been perceived as a divisive figure in Ukrainian society for her uncompromising stance.\n\nSince the 2022 invasion, many have considered Russia as \"the language of the oppressor\" and are trying to shift away from it. Meanwhile, Russia has been promoting the narrative that Ukraine is trying to suppress the Russian-speaking population in the country and has used it as part of its pretext to invade Ukraine.\n\nSome commentators have already voiced their suspicion that Russia was behind the assassination to reopen old linguistic and regional divisions in Ukraine at a time when the war requires maximum unity at home.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky promptly condemned Farion's killing.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He specified that all versions are being investigated, including the one leading to Russia.\n\nOn the evening of 19 July, a hitman shot former Ukrainian deputy, professor, and linguist Iryna Farion. The incident took place in Lviv on Masaryk Street, near her residence.\n\nWitnesses reported that the killer fired one shot and quickly fled the scene. As a result of the assassination attempt, Farion sustained a gunshot wound to the head. She was quickly hospitalized in a local hospital, where doctors tried to save her life for several hours, but their attempts appeared unsuccessful.\n\nLviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi and Head of the Lviv Regional State Administration Maksym Kozytskyi confirmed that Iryna Farion passed away at 11:20 PM.\n\nSixty-year-old Iryna Farion was born, raised, and spent almost her entire life in Lviv. For nearly 30 years, she gave lectures at the Lviv Polytechnic National University.\n\nDuring her work in the Ukrainian parliament, when Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions were in power, Farion opposed all initiatives that restricted the Ukrainian language. Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 after the Euromaidan protests.\n\nFarion also supported the ban on the activities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in Ukraine, according to Ukrainska Pravda.\n\n\"I believe that this structure, which calls itself the Moscow Patriarchate, has nothing to do with Christianity. It is one of the greatest threats to the free and self-sufficient development of Ukraine. And as long as this institution occupies the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, the Ukrainian will remain enslaved,\" the professor said in 2008.\n\nFollowing the 2014 snap elections, when her party did not enter the Verkhovna Rada, Farion returned to Lviv and continued her university career.\n\nAs of the night of 19-20 July, the police were considering several versions of the reasons for Iryna Farion's murder.\n\nThe main ones are - her public and political activities, as well as personal animosity towards her, said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko during a night briefing. After the news of the assassination attempt, he urgently went to Lviv.\n\nTo conduct operational measures, the Ministry of Internal Affairs involved the entire Lviv police and law enforcement of the Lviv region. Operatives and investigators from the National Police and the Security Service of Ukraine from Kyiv were also sent to the city.\n\nThe \"We-Ukraine\" TV channel quoted a resident of the apartment building on Masaryk Street in Lviv, where Farion lived. According to him, about two weeks ago, an unknown young man of around eighteen began appearing near the entrance. In the morning, he would sit on a bench opposite the professor's entrance and leave only in the evening, as per Zaxid.net.\n\nIn photos released by the media, he is seen wearing a black bucket hat, black sunglasses, and a red T-shirt with the inscription \"Los Angeles.\"\n\nIhor Klymenko confirmed that the stranger in the photo is the main suspect. The police are now conducting a search operation to detain him.\n\nThe linguist had repeatedly been at the center of public discussions due to her statements in defense of the Ukrainian language and her categorical claims about abandoning the Soviet past in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She was attacked on Friday evening as she stepped out of her house.\n\n\"There was a shot to the temple. The shooter was seen by the neighbors, he was wearing gloves and the weapon did not have a silencer,\" local journalist Marta Olyarnik said in a Facebook post.\n\nFarion was rushed to a local hospital. One local Telegram channel reported she was in critical condition, while city councilman Igor Zinkevich described her condition as \"serious.\"\n\nVideo from the scene showed a pool of blood on the street.

The gunman's identity and whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nFarion has been a member of 'Svoboda' (Freedom), formerly known as the Social-National Party of Ukraine, led by neo-Nazi Oleg Tyagnibok. She has expressed open sympathy for WWII neo-Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera.\n\nWhile in parliament, Farion championed a total ban on the use of Russian language in Ukraine.

Several months later, she called anyone who lived in Ukraine but did not speak Ukrainian \"biological waste.\"\n\nThis hard line has led her to clash with other nationalists.

gunman", "body": "A UKRAINIAN nationalist and former MP who infuriated Moscow has been shot and killed in her hometown.\n\nIrina Farion, 60, was shot in the head by a gunman in the city of Lviv but died after she was rushed to hospital.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has since ordered a joint manhunt for the gunman, who managed to escape the scene.\n\nAgents from the SBU intelligence service and the national police will now jointly investigate the high-profile shooting, amid fears of a Russian trace.\n\nInterior Minister Ihor Klymenko, writing on Telegram, said investigators were for the moment also linking the shooting either to Farion's political activity or to a personal motive.\n\nFarion, a linguist, became a member of the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party in 2005 and was elected to parliament in 2012, but failed in subsequent attempts to win a seat.\n\nShe had also served on the Lviv regional council.\n\nFarion was a staunch advocate of the Ukrainian language and controversially had criticised the many Russian-speaking members of Ukraine's armed forces.\n\n\"They were not fully Ukrainian,\" she said.\n\nFarion also advocated for the abandonment of Russian-speaking in the country, even though around a quarter of the population use it as their first language.\n\nThe former MP had been under investigation in Ukraine for her outspoken comments and faced strong criticism from Russians.\n\nIn 2018, when Ukraine was fighting Russian-financed separatists who had seized territory in the east, she called for a drive to \"punch every Russian-speaking person in the jaw\".\n\nAnd in the early months of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Farion denounced Russian-speaking fighters of the Azov regiment who defended the port city of Mariupol for three months.\n\nTop Putin propagandist Margarita Simonyan, head of the RT state media empire, said: \"Iryna Farion, who dreamed of the 'complete disposal' of the Russian-speaking population, has been disposed of....\n\n\"God sorts it out without us.\"\n\nFarion had been watched for several weeks by a man who is now the main suspect, reports say.\n\n\"Tragic news: despite all efforts by medical staff, Iryna Farion's life could not be saved,\" said Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nA neighbour said the alleged suspect was \"dressed strangely and was constantly looking at the entrance where she lives\".\n\nHe was allegedly seen in a long sweater, dark glasses and wearing a hat.\n\nIt comes after a court in Russia sentenced innocent American journalist Evan Gershkovich to 16 years in prison following a sham trial.\n\nEvan, 32, pleaded not guilty during the closed-door trial over bogus espionage charges, which came to an abrupt end on Friday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reporter has been wrongly accused by Vladimir Putin's crooks of collecting \"secret information\" for the CIA.\n\nThey have offered no evidence of Evan's 'crimes' since he was arrested on March 29, 2023.\n\nProsecutors had requested a horrific 18-year sentence for Evan, the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Soviet era.\n\nPictures from the court in Yekaterinburg, south west Russia, showed him inside a glass cage as the verdict was read out.\n\nMeanwhile, paranoid Putin installed a ring of air defences around his lake and forest palace northwest of Moscow amid fears of Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussian media claim to have mapped the array of Pantsir-S1 air defence systems guarding the 71-year-old dictator's lavish Valdai residence.\n\nThere is also an S-400 air defence system deployed in the ring of steel - far more comprehensive than many Russian cities.\n\nA new Pantsir-S1 - mounted on a tower in the forest on Ryabinovy Island - has appeared near the Valdai residence.\n\nThis was seen on Google satellite images taken on May 6 this year, it was reported.\n\nHe shares the Valdai retreat with his lover Alina Kabaeva, 41, and their secret young family, independent media reports in Russia claim.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi said the former MP died shortly after arriving at the hospital.\n\nThe shooting is being treated as an attempted assassination, explained Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said any act of violence was to be condemned, adding he was getting regular updates on how the search for the gunman was going, reports the Guardian.\n\nThe linguist joined the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party back in 2005 but didn't become an MP until 2012, failing in subsequent attempts to win a seat. She had also served on the regional council in Lviv.\n\nFarion became known for her campaigns to promote the Ukrainian language as well as discrediting public officials who spoke Russian. Back in 2018, as the country fought Russian-financed separatists who had taken over territory in the east, she called for a campaign to \"punch every Russian-speaking person in the jaw\".\n\nShe also condemned Russian-speaking fighters of the Azov regiment who defended Mariupol for three months back in 2022, in the early months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February that year.\n\nWhile Ukrainian is the only state language in the country, Russian is the first language of many Ukrainians, a legacy of Soviet rule. The promotion of Ukrainian has been a key issue for a long time, with legislation being passed to entrench its use in public life and in the services industry.\n\nOn Friday, Volodymyr Zelensky appealed for permission to strike targets in Russia with British missiles as he addressed the Cabinet. The Ukrainian president urged Keir Starmer's ministers to \"show your leadership\" by encouraging Western countries to do the same.\n\nAt the historic gathering in Downing Street, the Prime Minister vowed to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Mr Zelensky is the first foreign leader to address the Cabinet in person since Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nHe urged the British Government to help with Kyiv's \"long-range capability\", telling ministers: \"We are still missing the main answer to this question. I ask you to show your leadership in this and please convince other partners to remove the limits.\"\n\nUkraine has said lifting restrictions on Western weapons - including British Storm Shadow missiles - to strike deep into Russian territory is key to strengthening its defence and securing its frontline position in the war. The UK Government has said it is a matter for Kyiv how it chooses to deploy its resources, as long as international law is upheld.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

She later held a parliamentary position in 2012 but was unsuccessful in her future electoral campaigns.\n\nShe had also served on the Lviv regional council.\n\nFarion was known for her strong support for the Ukrainian language and had sparked debates by openly criticizing the large number of Russian-speaking individuals within Ukraine's military ranks.\n\n\"They were not fully Ukrainian,\" she said.\n\nFarion also advocated for the abandonment of Russian-speaking in the country, even though around a quarter of the population use it as their first language.\n\nThe former MP had been under investigation in Ukraine for her outspoken comments and faced strong criticism from Russians.\n\nIn 2018, when Ukraine was fighting Russian-financed separatists who had seized territory in the east, she called for a drive to \"punch every Russian-speaking person in the jaw\".\n\nAnd in the early months of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Farion denounced Russian-speaking fighters of the Azov regiment who defended the port city of Mariupol for three months.\n\nTop Putin propagandist Margarita Simonyan, head of the RT state media empire, said: \"Irina Farion, who dreamed of the 'complete disposal' of the Russian-speaking population, has been disposed of....\n\n\"God sorts it out without us.\"\n\nFarion had been watched for several weeks by a man who is now the main suspect, reports say.\n\n\"Tragic news: despite all efforts by medical staff, Irina Farion's life could not be saved,\" said Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nA neighbour said the alleged suspect was \"dressed strangely and was constantly looking at the entrance where she lives\".\n\nHe was allegedly seen in a long sweater, dark glasses and wearing a hat.\n\nIt comes after a court in Russia sentenced innocent American journalist Evan Gershkovich to 16 years in prison following a sham trial.\n\nEvan, 32, pleaded not guilty during the closed-door trial over bogus espionage charges, which came to an abrupt end on Friday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reporter has been wrongly accused by Vladimir Putin's crooks of collecting \"secret information\" for the CIA.\n\nThey have offered no evidence of Evan's 'crimes' since he was arrested on March 29, 2023.\n\nProsecutors had requested a horrific 18-year sentence for Evan, the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Soviet era.\n\nPictures from the court in Yekaterinburg, south west Russia, showed him inside a glass cage as the verdict was read out.\n\nMeanwhile, paranoid Putin installed a ring of air defences around his lake and forest palace northwest of Moscow amid fears of Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussian media claim to have mapped the array of Pantsir-S1 air defence systems guarding the 71-year-old dictator's lavish Valdai residence.\n\nThere is also an S-400 air defence system deployed in the ring of steel - far more comprehensive than many Russian cities.\n\nA new Pantsir-S1 - mounted on a tower in the forest on Ryabinovy Island - has appeared near the Valdai residence.\n\nThis was seen on Google satellite images taken on May 6 this year, it was reported.\n\nHe shares the Valdai retreat with his lover Alina Kabaeva, 41, and their secret young family, independent media reports in Russia claim.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The incident took place in Lviv on Masaryk Street, near the apartment building where she lived.\n\nWitnesses reported that the killer fired a single shot and quickly fled the scene. Farion sustained a gunshot wound to the head as a result of the attempt.\n\nShe was taken urgently to a local hospital, where doctors tried for several hours to save her but were unable to do so. Iryna Farion died at 23:20. The news was officially announced by Andrii Sadovyi, Mayor of Lviv, and Maksym Kozytskyi, Head of the Lviv Oblast Military Administration.\n\nThe crime has rocked the country and left many questions unanswered. Ukrainska Pravda presents the details of this high-profile murder, as well as the lines of enquiry being pursued by police.\n\nA friend of Farion's family told Ukrainska Pravda that the professor had been planning to leave Lviv for a short holiday, as it had been a long time since she last had a break. She had planned to spend Friday evening with her family, including her daughter and two grandchildren, whom she was on her way to visit.\n\n\"She called her daughter Sofiia just before the assassination attempt and said that she had just finished recording a new video for her YouTube channel and could relax now. She was going to theirs for dinner. The shooter hit her as she was waiting outside for a taxi,\" a friend of the deceased's family said.\n\nIryna Farion was taken to St Panteleimon's Hospital in Lviv at around 20:00 in a critical condition.\n\nNataliia Matolinets, Head of Anaesthesiology at the First Medical Association of Lviv, said Farion immediately underwent a full-body CT scan and emergency surgery.\n\nDmytro Symak, a close friend and colleague of the professor, was at the hospital as the team of doctors was trying to revive her. He told Ukrainska Pravda that the police and the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) were at the hospital.\n\n\"I was waiting to hear the outcome of the operation with her daughter Sofiia and the lawyer who assisted her in court after she was dismissed from Lviv Polytechnic, next to the intensive care unit. The doctors came out and immediately said that there was nothing they could do. She was shot at close range, the bullet hit her in the head.\n\nThey let us go into the intensive care unit. We went over to Iryna's bedside. She was in a deep coma, but still breathing.\n\nThe doctors started performing artificial respiration, starting her heart, doing everything possible and impossible for about 15 minutes. By that time, it was clear that it was over. She died in front of our eyes. The doctors pronounced her dead,\" Symak said.\n\nAs of the night of 19-20 July, the police have considered several theories as to why Iryna Farion was murdered. The main reasons are her public and political activities, or the perpetrator may have been someone with personal animosity towards her. This was stated by Ihor Klymenko, Minister of Internal Affairs, during a night briefing. Klymenko travelled to Lviv immediately upon hearing about the attempted assassination.\n\n\"Other lines of enquiry may of course emerge. We already have some information about the crime and how it was carried out, but we are keeping it quiet for now because all the lines of enquiry are being checked out,\" Klymenko said.\n\nAnother high-ranking law enforcement source said that as of 01:00 on 20 July, two potential suspects had been eliminated. The investigation and search for the killer is ongoing.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs has tasked the entire police force of Lviv and part of the Lviv Oblast force with carrying out operational activities. In addition, authorised operatives and investigators from the National Police and the SSU have been sent to Lviv from Kyiv.\n\nThe TV channel We-Ukraine quoted one of the residents of the apartment building on Masaryk Street in Lviv where Farion lived as saying that a stranger, aged about 18, had begun to hang around the entrance to the building about two weeks ago. He would sit on a bench in front of the professor's entrance in the morning and not leave until the evening.\n\nA photograph published in the media shows him wearing a black panama hat, black glasses and a red T-shirt with the words \"Los Angeles\" on it.\n\n\"He had a very interesting style, and that's why I remembered him: it was hot, 40\u00b0C, and he'd be wearing sneakers, socks, sweatpants, a long sweatshirt like Americans wear, a hat and dark glasses. Whenever I went out or came home, he'd be there.\n\nThree days ago, I came back around lunchtime, and he was sitting on the bench. I thought to myself, it's 40\u00b0C, it's hot, and he's sitting there, there must be something wrong with him. I went over to him and said: 'Excuse me, can I help you?' 'Everything's fine,' he replied.\"\n\nIhor Klymenko has confirmed that the stranger in the photo is the main suspect. The police are now looking for him.\n\n\"The electricity is [periodically] cut off because of the rolling blackout priority system, so there have been problems determining who was at the entrance, including with the operation of the video cameras installed at the entrance, in order to confirm or eliminate this line of enquiry 100%,\" Klymenko said. \"So we're checking all the information, working with witnesses, and contacting anyone who can provide additional information for the investigation.\"\n\nIryna Farion, 60, was born and bred in Lviv and studied and worked there for almost all her life. She was a well-known Ukrainian language specialist who lectured at Lviv Polytechnic for almost 30 years and had also had a successful career in politics.\n\nFarion joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in the late 1980s, although for a long time she categorically denied this. However, in 2013, journalists found documents in the State Archives of Lviv Oblast that confirmed her Communist Party membership.\n\nFarion refused to comment on this even after the documents were made public. When a journalist asked her to respond, she said: \"An eagle does not confess to hyenas.\" Later, however, she confirmed her membership of the CPSU.\n\n\"As for my communist past. It lasted for one year, and so what?\" the professor said. \"Levko Lukianenko had a communist past, and he became the author of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. The famous [dissident] Mykola Rudenko had a communist past: he was the secretary of the party committee of the Kyiv organisation, and then he destroyed that Kyiv organisation and served more than 10 years in prison for it. You can talk about someone's communist past when there are actions. What actions did Farion take during her one-year membership of the Communist Party? None!\"\n\nFarion had been a member of the ultranationalist Svoboda party since 2005. She was elected to Lviv Oblast Council in 2006 and to the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) as an MP in 2012, running as a Svoboda candidate in both cases.\n\nDuring the 7th convocation of the Verkhovna Rada, when Viktor Yanukovych and the Party of Regions were in power, she opposed all initiatives that restricted the Ukrainian language.\n\nFarion also supported the ban on the activities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in Ukraine.\n\n\"I believe that this organisation, which calls itself the Moscow Patriarchate, has nothing to do with Christianity. It is one of the biggest threats to the free and self-sufficient development of Ukraine. And as long as this institution occupies the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra (the Monastery of the Caves in Kyiv), Ukrainians will be oppressed,\" the professor said back in 2008.\n\nSvoboda failed to win any seats in the Verkhovna Rada in the 2014 elections, so Farion returned to Lviv and continued her work as a professor.\n\nAs the media outlet ZAXID.NET mentioned, Iryna Farion hosted a television series, The Greatness of the Personality, on the Rada TV channel from 2013 to 2019, which aimed to popularise knowledge about significant figures in Ukrainian history, culture and politics. 160 programmes were broadcast during that period.\n\nFarion also created and wrote a TV series entitled The Ukrainian Gene (2019-2023), which aired on the Lviv-based TV channel NTA. In addition, she ran two YouTube channels, Iryna Farion and Studio Farion, where she presented three series: Anti-Anglicism, Political Review, and Ukrainian Language Culture Courses.\n\nThe linguist frequently hit the headlines due to her passionate defence of the Ukrainian language and her no-holds-barred statements about everything Soviet and Russian in Ukraine.\n\nThe SSU launched a criminal case against Iryna Farion in November 2023, conducting a psychological and linguistic analysis of her statements, after the professor stated that she did not recognise Russian-speaking military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n\"Can a soldier or officer not follow orders from his commanding officer without breaking the law? I would like to ask every Russian-speaking soldier: have you read the law on the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Ukrainian \u0421onstitution, have you read what is written in Article 13? The language of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the state language. So are you fighting for the Ukrainian state, or are you defending your right to be a speaker of the 'Russian world'? At least speak surzhyk [a Ukrainian-Russian pidgin], but don't speak Russian,\" Farion said.\n\nShe also shared a post on her social media containing a screenshot of a message from a pro-Ukrainian student from Crimea that included his full name and other personal details. This is alleged to have resulted in the Crimean citizen being harassed by Russian secret services.\n\nThe Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) turned up at the young man's home and took him to a \"centre for combating extremism\". Later, the Russians released a video of him \"repenting\" on social media. The student was seated in front of a Russian flag and forced to record a \"video confession\" in which he said that he \"completely renounces his views because he realises that he was wrong\". His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nA criminal case was then launched against Farion for violating the equality of citizens, insulting the honour and dignity of a serviceman, and violating the secrecy of correspondence and privacy. The pre-trial investigation is still ongoing.\n\nThis scandal led to protests by students at Lviv Polytechnic, who demanded Farion's dismissal. On 15 November 2023, she was suspended from her post at the university.\n\nHowever, the Lviv Court of Appeal reinstated the professor in her position at the University in late May 2024 and ordered the payment of compensation for her forced absence in the amount of UAH 124,000 (US$3,000).\n\nFarion spent the money she received on drones for the Rubizh Brigade, the Syla Svobody (Power of Freedom) and Svoboda (Freedom) Battalions, and the 5th Assault Brigade. She also announced a fundraising campaign called One Million for Drones to Kill the Enemy, with some of the funds raised going to the unit where her son-in-law Vasyl Osoba serves.\n\nYou can donate to the fundraiser using the following bank details:\n\nTarget: UAH 1,000,000.\n\nLink: monobank\n\nBank card number: 5375 4112 2017 8318\n\nPayPal: iryna.farion@gmail.com\n\nWritten by Anhelina

gunman", "body": "A UKRAINIAN nationalist and former MP who infuriated Moscow has been shot and killed in her hometown.\n\nInterior Minister Ihor Klymenko, writing on Telegram, said investigators were for the moment also linking the shooting either to Farion's political activity or to a personal motive.\n\nFarion, a linguist, became a member of the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party in 2005 and was elected to parliament in 2012, but failed in subsequent attempts to win a seat.\n\nShe had also served on the Lviv regional council.\n\nFarion was a staunch advocate of the Ukrainian language and controversially had criticised the many Russian-speaking members of Ukraine's armed forces.\n\n\"They were not fully Ukrainian,\" she said.\n\nFarion also advocated for the abandonment of Russian-speaking in the country, even though around a quarter of the population use it as their first language.\n\nThe former MP had been under investigation in Ukraine for her outspoken comments and faced strong criticism from Russians.\n\nIn 2018, when Ukraine was fighting Russian-financed separatists who had seized territory in the east, she called for a drive to \"punch every Russian-speaking person in the jaw\".\n\nAnd in the early months of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Farion denounced Russian-speaking fighters of the Azov regiment who defended the port city of Mariupol for three months.\n\nTop Putin propagandist Margarita Simonyan, head of the RT state media empire, said: \"Iryna Farion, who dreamed of the 'complete disposal' of the Russian-speaking population, has been disposed of....\n\n\"God sorts it out without us.\"\n\nFarion had been watched for several weeks by a man who is now the main suspect, reports say.\n\n\"Tragic news: despite all efforts by medical staff, Iryna Farion's life could not be saved,\" said Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi.\n\nA neighbour said the alleged suspect was \"dressed strangely and was constantly looking at the entrance where she lives\".\n\nHe was allegedly seen in a long sweater, dark glasses and wearing a hat.\n\nIt comes after a court in Russia sentenced innocent American journalist Evan Gershkovich to 16 years in prison following a sham trial.\n\nEvan, 32, pleaded not guilty during the closed-door trial over bogus espionage charges, which came to an abrupt end on Friday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reporter has been wrongly accused by Vladimir Putin's crooks of collecting \"secret information\" for the CIA.\n\nThey have offered no evidence of Evan's 'crimes' since he was arrested on March 29, 2023.\n\nProsecutors had requested a horrific 18-year sentence for Evan, the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Soviet era.\n\nPictures from the court in Yekaterinburg, south west Russia, showed him inside a glass cage as the verdict was read out.\n\nMeanwhile, paranoid Putin installed a ring of air defences around his lake and forest palace northwest of Moscow amid fears of Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussian media claim to have mapped the array of Pantsir-S1 air defence systems guarding the 71-year-old dictator's lavish Valdai residence.\n\nThere is also an S-400 air defence system deployed in the ring of steel - far more comprehensive than many Russian cities.\n\nA new Pantsir-S1 - mounted on a tower in the forest on Ryabinovy Island - has appeared near the Valdai residence.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juliana_cruz_lima@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Juliana Cruz Lima", "type": "author",

A linguist who belonged to a hard-line nationalist party, she was despised by some for her denunciation of Russian-speaking fighters in elite Ukrainian military units. Many Ukrainians speak Russian, especially in eastern regions closer to Russia.\n\nMs. Farion, 60, was shot in the head by a young man on a street in the western city of Lviv on Friday evening, and the Ukrainian authorities said early Saturday that they were still searching for the gunman, who fled the scene. Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine's interior minister, said he believed she was targeted for killing.\n\n\"This was not a spontaneous murder,\" he told a news conference on Saturday, adding that it might have been politically motivated or a personal matter. He did not rule out possible Russian involvement.\n\nSeveral former officials also said Moscow might have been behind the killing in an attempt to sow divisions, while other people raised fears that the shooting could polarize society. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday, \"All versions are being investigated, including the one that leads to Russia.\"\n\nMysterious deaths and assassinations were a feature of Ukraine's political landscape before Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. But there had been no sign of any high-profile killings or attempted assassinations since the war broke out.\n\nSome Ukrainians called for a swift and transparent investigation into the killing, saying it would be a sign that, even at war, Ukraine remains a functioning democracy. Mr. Zelensky said on Friday that \"any violence deserves to be condemned and anyone responsible for this attack must be held fully accountable.\"\n\nMs. Farion, an award-winning linguist who taught at the Lviv Polytechnic National University, started out as a member of the Communist Party when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before veering right and eventually joining the hard-line nationalist Svoboda, or Freedom, party in 2005. She was elected to Parliament in 2012, but failed in subsequent attempts to keep or regain her seat.\n\nSvoboda wrote on Facebook that \"this crime benefits Muscovy and was undoubtedly committed by it,\" using a derogatory term for Russia. But already, in a sign of possible divisions to come, Svoboda accused Ukraine's government of failing to purge itself of pro-Russian agents, thereby enabling the killing.\n\nMykola Davidiuk, a Ukrainian political analyst, said that Ms. Farion was a regular guest on Ukrainian television shows in the early 2010s, a time when Ukraine's political landscape was deeply fractured between forces advocating closer ties with Moscow and others calling for a clear break with Russia.\n\n\"She was a very controversial figure,\" he said.\n\nLast fall, Ms. Farion denounced elements of the Ukrainian military, in particular members of the Azov and Third Assault Brigades -- two units with ties to far-right and nationalist movements -- for communicating in Russian. She said she couldn't call Russian-speaking forces Ukrainians.\n\nLanguage is a sensitive issue in Ukraine.\n\nBefore the war, most people spoke both Ukrainian and Russian, the lingua franca of the Soviet Union. Mr. Zelensky himself, a native Russian speaker, only started speaking Ukrainian publicly when he ran for president in 2019.\n\nRussia's 2022 invasion prompted many in Ukraine to stop speaking Russian and switch entirely to Ukrainian. But Russian is still widely spoken in the country, including in the military. Many soldiers have no problem with it, saying that the most important thing is good communication in combat.\n\nMs. Farion's accusations caused a wave of indignation in Ukraine, with some saying she was trying to divide society and discredit elite military units known for their fierce defense of Ukrainian cities such as Mariupol during the war.\n\n\"What she said about those men was incomprehensible to me,\" Sofia Kocharovska, 23, a resident of Kyiv, said on Saturday.\n\nIn November, the Ukrainian security services opened a criminal investigation into Ms. Farion's statements and publications. She was also fired from Lviv Polytechnic that month.\n\nBut she challenged the decision in court, and an appeals court ruled in May that she should be reinstated and receive compensation.", "source":

Russian bombing raids against Ukraine's power generation infrastructure have triggered nationwide power cuts.\n\nIgor Klimenko, Ukraine's interior ministry, said investigators were working on several potential motives.\n\n\"The main ones, I can say, are social, political activity and personal hostility,\" he said.\n\n'Sow fear among all Ukrainians'\n\nFarion, 60, was well-known in Ukraine as a prominent linguistics professor and for pushing a hard-line nationalist agenda.\n\nShe was an MP for the Right-wing Svoboda party from 2012-14 and sparked controversy last year when she said that Ukrainian soldiers who spoke Russian couldn't be considered true patriots and should be thrown out of the army.\n\nLanguage is a sensitive issue in Ukraine and although Ukrainian has gained in popularity since Russia's invasion in 2022, millions of people still regard Russian as their first language.\n\nFarion's comments gained fierce criticism from the Ukrainian military, which is suffering from a recruitment crisis. She was also fired as a professor at Lviv Polytechnic University, although she was reinstated last month.\n\nOn social media, Russian commentators celebrated the murder of Farion, who they regarded as an \"odious Ukrainian nationalist\".\n\nOxana Shevel, an associate professor in political science at Tufts University in the US, said: \"Killing her is meant to sow fear among all in Ukraine who publicly speak out against Russia's genocidal war.\"\n\nFarion's death is the first assassination of a high-profile official in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, although Ukrainian security services have foiled a handful of plots to kill Mr Zelensky.\n\nUkrainian special forces have also been accused of several assassinations in Russia.\n\nIn August 2022, Darya Dugina, a pro-war Russian journalist, was killed by a car bomb near Moscow and in July 2023 a Russian submarine commander was shot dead by a gunman as he jogged through a park in Krasnodar.", "source":

The shooter approached his victim and shot her in the head, using a Makarov pistol.\n\nDoctors fought for Farion's life for several hours, but the wound proved fatal. Farion will be buried on Monday, July 22 at 14:00 at Lychakiv Cemetery, near the grave of Volodymyr Ivasiuk. OBOZ.UA found out what versions of the murder the investigation has, what is known about the killer, and how politicians reacted to Farion's death.\n\nWhat versions does the investigation have?\n\nInterior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that law enforcement agencies are considering several versions of the murder of former MP Iryna Farion. Among them are the public and political activities of the linguist, as well as personal dislike for her. At the same time, law enforcement officers do not rule out that the murder could have been a contract killing and was planned by the terrorist country Russia.\n\nOperatives and investigative teams from Kyiv, led by the deputy head of the National Police and the deputy head of the Security Service of Ukraine, are working to solve the crime.\n\nOn the morning of July 20, Zelenskyy said that he had heard new reports from the Interior Minister and the head of the SBU on the investigation into the murder of Iryna Farion. The President noted that all available surveillance cameras were being used, witnesses were being interviewed, and the territory of several districts was being examined. All versions are being investigated, including the one leading to Russia.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor General Anton Voitenko took part in a meeting with the Minister of Internal Affairs on the investigation of Farion's murder. During the meeting, law enforcement officers discussed the results of priority measures aimed at identifying and detaining the attacker.\n\nThe Prosecutor General's Office noted that versions are being worked out, including a premeditated murder related to the victim's professional activities and active civil position.\n\nA set of investigative actions and operational and search activities is being carried out, including yard and house-to-house visits to obtain information relevant to the pre-trial investigation. Video surveillance cameras are being installed and measures are being taken to obtain video recordings that will be relevant to the investigation (at the scene, near the scene, and on the offender's approach and departure routes). In addition, several necessary forensic examinations have also been ordered.\n\nWhat is known about the killer\n\nLaw enforcement officers continue to search for the attacker. According to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, residents of the house near where the murder took place allegedly saw a suspicious man for two weeks. He also emphasized that law enforcement officers already have some information about Farion's murder and the perpetrator of the crime.\n\nAccording to Lviv media, Farion was shot by a man aged 20-25. According to eyewitnesses, the shooter repeatedly followed the woman near the entrance.\n\nLocal residents say that they have repeatedly seen a suspicious man in a long sweater, dark glasses, and a hat near the entrance to Farion's apartment building. They are now trying to identify him.\n\nThe investigation confirmed that he had indeed been near the victim's house for several days. As of now, the police believe that the man in the hat and the attacker are the same person. At the same time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs emphasized that due to the power outage, the work of video surveillance cameras was interrupted, which complicates the search for the killer.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the killer used a Makarov pistol. One shell casing from a Makarov pistol was found at the crime scene.\n\nThe Suspilne media outlet found out what was happening near Farion's house on the eve of the murder. The victim's neighbors said that an unknown person had been watching Farion for several weeks before the murder.\n\n\"He was here for two weeks and just looked at her. He was here every day since the week before last. Every day at 10 o'clock he sat on a bench here. Neighbors would come up to him and ask: \"How are you sitting here, don't you want to eat or drink?\" He would say that he had lunch. They asked him: \"Where are you from?\" He said: \"From Ternopil\". I did not talk to him. What do I have to do with him?\" Farion's neighbor said.\n\nPossible involvement of the Russian Federation in Farion's murder\n\nThe leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine does not rule out that the murder of the linguist was planned by order of the terrorist country Russia. In addition, political analyst Oleh Sahakian said that Farion's murder could be part of a large Russian special operation to destabilize the situation in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the political scientist, the Russians may now intensify provocations because the level of trust in the government in Ukraine has significantly eroded.\n\nUkrainian journalist Yuriy Butusov says that Farion's murder is primarily beneficial to Russia. He reminded that Russian media wrote about her almost daily and mentioned her continuously.\n\n\"The Ukrainian authorities are obliged to immediately find the killer and expose the crime. This is a test to see whether the state controls the situation at all, whether law enforcement is capable, and whether Russian agents can commit terrorist attacks in the deep rear with impunity,\" the journalist said.\n\nReaction of politicians and government officials\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to Farion's murder. The head of state said that the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the head of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Maliuk were promptly reporting to him on the search for the attacker. The President emphasized that all the necessary forces of the National Police of Ukraine and the Security Service of Ukraine are involved in establishing the circumstances of this crime.\n\n\"Obviously, any violence deserves only condemnation, and everyone who is guilty of this attack must be held fully accountable,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitalii Klytschko said that violence should not become a method of dealing with opponents and those who think differently.\n\n\"The murder of Iryna Farion is a provocation and a challenge. To the law enforcement system, democracy, and stability in the country. It should be investigated promptly and openly to the public,\" Klytschko wrote.\n\nOmbudsman Dmytro Lubinets also reacted to the death of Iryna Farion. He called for finding the linguist's killer and bringing him to justice.\n\nThe third president of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, said that those who planned and carried out such a dastardly attack must be identified and brought to justice. In addition, he wished the Farion family the strength to withstand this heavy and unfair blow of fate.\n\n\"Eternal memory and kingdom of heaven, dear Ms. Farion! May God now grant you eternal peace and the memory of the difficult path of devotion to the ideas of the Ukrainian nation. She was sincere in her love for Ukraine and defended it as she saw fit,\" Yushchenko said in a statement.\n\nCommissioner for the Protection of the State Language Taras Kremin said that during her lifetime Iryna Farion became a true legend in the open, decisive, courageous struggle against the real enemies of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier it was reported that Ukrainian showbiz stars reacted to the death of linguist and former MP Iryna Farion, who had been the victim of an assassination attempt the day before. Celebrities did not remain indifferent to the tragedy and condemned the violence, expressing their condolences to the victim's family.\n\nAs a reminder, Iryna Farion was known for her controversial statements and was regularly involved in scandals. Over the past two years, she had a quarrel with the Ukrainian military over the language issue, which led to criminal proceedings being opened against her, and even lost her job at Lviv Polytechnic.",

Irina Farion is dead", "body": "The attack took place on Friday evening in Lviv. According to Ukrainian media, at around 7:30 p.m. local time, an unknown assailant shot Irina Varion and fled the scene. It is unofficially known that the bullet hit her temple. The woman was taken to the hospital in critical condition. There, doctors fought for her life. Late in the evening, news of her death came.\n\n\"Irina Varion died in the hospital. The doctors did everything they could, but the injuries did not allow them to survive. The Lviv community expresses its sincere condolences to the family and everyone who knew and loved her,\" Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoy wrote on the platform.\n\nTwitter\n\nEarlier, Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Telegram that the woman's condition was very serious.\n\n\"All necessary forces of the Ukrainian National Police and the Security Service of Ukraine are involved in establishing the circumstances of the attack,\" the Ukrainian president wrote. The perpetrator is currently being sought. Zelensky stressed the need to hold those responsible for the attack fully accountable.\n\nIryna Varion was a Ukrainian linguist and activist of the New Bandera movement Svoboda. In the past, she was a member of the Ukrainian parliament on behalf of this party. The last time she was mentioned was in November last year. Then she stated that Russian-speaking soldiers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine \"cannot be called Ukrainians.\" For these words, she was dismissed from the Lviv University of Technology.

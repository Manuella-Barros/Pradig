This is the view of Alma Jordan, the founder of AgriKids \u2013 a child farm safety educational platform launched in 2015. Speaking to Agriland, Jordan said the main threat to children, and the main cause of fatalities involving children on farms, remains tractors and machinery. \u201cWhen it comes to safety on the farm, definitely at this time of the year, I suppose the theme that I would love to see adopted and taken on board is caution and common sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other workplace where child exposure to risk is so high, and definitely the accessibility that children have to farm vehicles and farm machinery is a major factor within that.\u201d Jordan said the farming sector must denormalise this exposure to risk that children are presented with all too often, especially now during the \u201cheights of silage and hay season\u201d. \u201cThe amount of times I\u2019ve seen on social media children actively driving and using farm machinery, and it being presented in a way that\u2019s this kind of badge of honour, this kind of right of passage,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to denormalise that. It\u2019s not appropriate, it\u2019s not suitable and it\u2019s definitely not fair.\u201d The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has said children between the ages of seven and 16 may ride on a tractor if it is fitted with a properly designed and fitted passenger seat (with seat belts) inside a safety cab or frame. Under no circumstances should a child under seven years of age be carried inside the cab of a tractor, irrespective of whether a passenger seat is provided or not, the HSA has stressed. \u2018I don\u2019t buy any of those excuses\u2019 Jordan said children and younger teenagers driving and handling farm machinery is something she will \u201cnever be okay with\u201d. \u201cI understand it and I\u2019ve heard the arguments that \u2018labour is short. We need help. They\u2019ve been doing it forever. It\u2019s how we all started. It\u2019s how we all learned. If we don\u2019t expose them to this aspect of farm life, they\u2019re not going to get into farming\u2019,\u201d she said \u201cI don\u2019t really buy any of those excuses because you know, we\u2019re coming up to June 30, we\u2019ll see the 11th Embrace Farm Ecumenical Service where we get to remember those lost to a farming accident. \u201cWhen you see the young children whose faces are up on the altar and you see all the people up there who we have lost, and you meet the families and you meet those who have been affected by a farming accident where they\u2019ve lost somebody or they\u2019ve had a life-altering injury, it\u2019s very hard to accept the excuses that are put out there.\u201d Between 2011 and 2020, children made up 10% of all farm fatalities. 85% of the 21 deaths were caused by tractors, farm vehicles or other machinery. \u201cIf I worked in a factory, if I worked in an office, if I worked in the construction site, I wouldn\u2019t be bringing my child with me,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be having my newborn baby on the floor of the tractor cab as I\u2019m driving around or in or in a milk crate, as I\u2019ve seen before. \u201cIt\u2019s really when you\u2019ve met a paramedic, it\u2019s when you\u2019ve met a guard, it\u2019s when you\u2019ve met a family, when you\u2019ve held a mother, that it really comes home how dangerous a farm is and how quickly things can change.\u201d Age-appropriate jobs Jordan said farms must adopt an attitude centred on age-appropriate jobs and age-appropriate risk. \u201cI grew up on a farm, I understand how difficult it is. I understand that everybody gets involved with the farm. It is the family business, but we need to be adopting an attitude of age-appropriate jobs and age-appropriate risk,\u201d she said. \u201cAny child 9, 10, 11 or 12-years-of-age being left alone to manage a 30t tractor and trailer is a prime example where common sense is just not existing on our farms. \u201cI\u2019d really call on the government here and the policymakers to step in and, not put rules in into place, because we already have rules. \u201cThe rules aren\u2019t being followed and not being enforced, so to kind of come back with some level of compromise here.\u201d If farmers are struggling with labour and access to contractors, Jordan said something should be done by the government to \u201cnip it in the bud\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t want people to be thinking about farm safety for me or for the HSA. But to do it for the kids. Do it for their own children. Do it for those families who have lost. \u201cWe\u2019re not denying children their right of passage that goes with life on a farm, we want them to treat the farm with respect. We want them to treat it as a place of work and to value it as a workplace. \u201cI understand that it is a home and all that but at the end of the day we are losing people. People are literally dying and we have to really ask ourselves \u2013 what can we do to prevent this?\u201d AgriKids Since the launch of AgriKids in 2015, Jordan said she has singlehandedly organised workshops, programmes and events. \u201cI have met with government; I\u2019ve met with policymakers; I\u2019ve worked with some of the leading farm organisations,\u201d she said. \u201cYet I\u2019m still left unsupported in delivering this message, so if they\u2019re really serious about farm safety, if they are true, and they say \u2018I\u2019ve got a great idea, I\u2019ve got a great approach\u2019, well allow me to do it on a bigger scale. \u201cI am dealing with probably one of the most valuable and most vulnerable aspects of our community, which is the children. \u201cI\u2019ve recognised their ability in dealing with this issue and \u2018pester power\u2019 is a well known method for changing attitudes and changing culture and children are hugely influential within that.\u201d Jordan said she has seen children speaking with their grandparents about farm safety and going home and having conversations with their family. At one school in Wexford, Jordan said a farm safety week was organised and topics from machinery to mental health were dealt with by students, parents and the wider community. \u201cThis community-led approach is absolutely vital and it\u2019s what AgriKids has been all about since the beginning. \u201cWe want to change culture and the only way we\u2019re going to do that is by working together.\u201d Jordan advised anyone affected by the content of this article to contact farm accident support network, Embrace FARM.", "summary": "<p>Children driving and using farm machinery must be denormalised in farming, as it is not &#8220;appropriate, suitable or fair&#8221;.

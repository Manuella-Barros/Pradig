Born in Calcutta, India, Dr Mosley attended boarding school in England before studying PPE at Oxford. After trying investment banking he retrained as a doctor before joining the BBC as an assistant trainee producer. Dr Mosley made a string of science and history documentaries over 25 years, rising to become a presenter and an executive producer at the corporation. In his journalistic career he has worked alongside the likes of John Cleese, Jeremy Clarkson, Professor Robert Winston and Sir David Attenborough. His career on screen was spent challenging stale ideas, bringing his talents of wit, gusto and lateral thinking to testing theories - often on himself. MailOnline takes a look back on the TV doctor's career on our screens over the years. Ulcer Wars - 1994 In 1994, Dr Moseley did his first full-length project. The Horizon documentary was about Barry Marshall, a self-experimenter. He was convinced that stomach ulcers aren't caused by stress but by an organism. The show generated more than 20,000 letters and as a result Mosley was named medical journalist of the year by the British Medical Association. He said at the time: 'I probably did, in a funny way, more good with that one programme than if I had stayed in medicine for 30 years.' Trust me, I'm a Doctor - 1996 In November 1996, the documentary show first aired with a combination of factual reporting and satire, presented by Phil Hammond and helped produced by Dr Mosley. In the show, medical experts provide health as well as nutrition-based tips to people to help them lead healthy lives. They also discuss popular health claims and deconstruct myths surrounding the topic. The original BBC Two show ran until 1999 and in 2013, the show returned - with Dr Mosley as the presenter. Blood and Guts - 2008 In 2008, Dr Mosely presented a documentary series looking at the brutal, bloody and dangerous history of surgery.

The One Show - 2009 The doctor made multiple appearances on The One Show, including investigating hypnosis for pain relief with Stewart Derbyshire of Birmingham University. In this episode, he was hypnotised as a pin was jabbed into his hand as far as it would go but it only felt like applying 'suntan lotion' with no pain. The Story of Science - 2010 The Story of Science was a science documentary presented by Dr Mosley in 2010 on BBC Two. It aired for one series, with six hour-long episodes, exploring how scientific understanding has developed over time. 'James Bond' Bungee Jump - 2011 The health guru bungee jumped from the Verzasca Dam in Switzerland - the highest in dam in Europe. The dam was made famous when a stuntman jumped off it in the opening scene of the James Bond film 'Goldeneye'. Peering over the edge, he realised the magnitude of the height as he said with trepidation 'oh that is real now'. 'That is terrifying, that is absolutely terrifying' he said before jumping, screaming, and commentating 'that is absolutely horrible - being upside down is worse'. He went on to say: 'I'm waiting for the euphoric moment to kick in any moment now.' Inside The Human Body - 2011 Dr Mosley also talked to different people around the world who have gone through remarkable changes. Using graphics and stories, he traced development from birth to adulthood, and revealed that the brain is so sophisticated it takes more than twenty years to mature.

It also explored the danger of sitting for prolonged periods of time and revealed how certain people are not able to see significant improvements in aerobics though endurance exercise. Infested! Living with Parasites - 2014 BBC Four series Infested! Living with Parasites aired in 2014 and saw Dr Mosley explore the world of parasites by infesting himself with them. For six weeks, he used his body as a laboratory and allowed a tapeworm to live in him to study its impact on his body. He ended up suffering no major negative effects, but did put on a kilogram in weight. He also stuck a leech on his arm and tried to infest himself with lice. Dr Moseley even took sodium thiopental - known as truth serum - and also took the magic mushroom drug psilocybin while having his brain scanned. The Truth About Getting Fit - 2018 Dr Mosley teamed up with scientists to investigate how people can workout more smartly. With the help of volunteers and researchers, he investigated what might have the greatest impact - walking 10,000 steps a day or completing three 10-minute sessions of brisk walking a day.

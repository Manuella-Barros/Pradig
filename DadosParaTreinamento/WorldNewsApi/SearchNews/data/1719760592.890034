According to the broadcaster, there are ministers in the cabinet who believe that this is a negotiable matter, but it noted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and those close to him insist that this would be a \u201csurrender\u201d to the resistance movement. \u201cThis is our last chance to return the hostages in Gaza and reach an agreement,\u201d an Israeli official participating in negotiations was quoted as saying. \u201cWe along with the mediators understand this. If an agreement is not reached, the Israeli army will enter Rafah, and the hostages will not be released. They will die and the matter may escalate.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Israel submitted its proposal for a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, said Kan 11. It also indicated an expansion of the Israeli army\u2019s attack on Rafah, in which four army brigades are now involved. The official channel quoted unnamed foreign sources as saying that this expansion creates obstacles for the talks, amid predictions that negotiations will resume next week in the Qatar capital, Doha. A minister in the War Cabinet and former chief of staff of the Israeli army, Gadi Eisenkot, warned on Monday that Hamas is renewing its strength. Fighting it will continue for many years, he said, so reaching a prisoner deal is a strategic necessity. While Eisenkot said that it is necessary \u201cto reach the end of fighting in Rafah and at the same time move forward along the path of a hostage deal, in which we will cease fire for 42 days or double that,\u201d he added that there is no \u201ctrade-off between releasing prisoners in exchange for ending the war.\u201d OPINION: Israel has killed displaced Palestinians since 1948, not just since 7 October", "summary": "<div style=\"float:left; width:30%\"><img width=\"992\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AA-20240413-34262720-34262719-ISRAELI_WAR_CABINET_MEETING_IN_TEL_AVIV-e1715067361838.jpg\" class=\"attachment-featured-img size-featured-img wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" 0=\"float:left\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AA-20240413-34262720-34262719-ISRAELI_WAR_CABINET_MEETING_IN_TEL_AVIV-e1715067361838.jpg?w=992&amp;ssl=1 992w, https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AA-20240413-34262720-34262719-ISRAELI_WAR_CABINET_MEETING_IN_TEL_AVIV-e1715067361838.jpg?resize=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px\" data-attachment-id=\"727281\" data-permalink=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/israeli-war-cabinet-meeting-in-tel-aviv-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AA-20240413-34262720-34262719-ISRAELI_W", "url": "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240529-israel-war-cabinet-split-on-hamas-demand-to-stop-the-war/", "image": "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AA-20240413-34262720-34262719-ISRAELI_WAR_CABINET_MEETING_IN_TEL_AVIV-e1715067361838.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:20:08", "author": "Middle East Monitor,saif", "authors": ["Middle East Monitor", "saif"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.011}

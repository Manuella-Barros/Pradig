The club has agreed to terms on a one-year deal with former New York Giants wideout Sterling Shepard, according to NFL Media. The financial terms were not immediately disclosed.\n\nUp until this point, Shepard had spent his entire NFL career with the Giants after the team selected him in the second round with the 40th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. The now 31-year-old did impress out of the gate with a 683-yard and eight-touchdown season as a rookie, which helped the Giants to an 11-5 season and a playoff berth. That was the most success Shepard experienced with New York as he was sidelined due to a torn ACL during the 2022 season when the franchise was able to advance to the divisional round.\n\nWhile there wasn't much overall team success, Shepard himself proved to be a strong outlet in the passing game throughout his tenure in East Rutherford. Last season, he surpassed former tight end Jeremy Shockey to land inside the Giants' all-time receptions list with 372. Shepard also ranks 16th and 18th on the franchise's all-time receiving yards and receiving touchdowns list, respectively.\n\nSterling Shepard NYG * WR * #3 TAR22REC10REC YDs57REC TD1FL1 View Profile\n\nMore recently, injuries have plagued the latter half of Shepard's career. He had a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 15 of the 2021 season and that torn ACL in 2022. Last season, he was able to suit up in 15 games during the regular season but was a limited fixture in the offense, participating in just 15% of the snaps.\n\nEven with the Giants being the only NFL club that he's ever known, the Buccaneers do provide Shepard with some familiarity. The wideout played with current Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield during their days at Oklahoma, so there should be some rapport between the two even after all these years.\n\nShepard joins a Bucs receiver room that is headlined by Mike Evans and Chris Godwin and also features Trey Palmer and 2024 third-round pick Jalen McMillan.\n\nTampa Bay's mandatory minicamp begins on June 11.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_sullivan@cbssports.com", "name": "Tyler Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Shepard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sterling Shepard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baker Mayfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Shockey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Shockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trey Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Evans_(wide_receiver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Evans (wide receiver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Godwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Godwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/06/26c46cf5-ac19-4351-948a-7031ad8705ee/thumbnail/1200x675/b6d71ca4bb95163cf30eb69abc01aeff/template-pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630829", "eventUri": "eng-9630829", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 2220, "textEnd": 2227}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

That was first in the NFC South, giving the team a home playoff game. The Bucs hosted the Eagles in the wildcard round. Tampa Bay was able to stun Philadelphia and won the game 32-9. Against the Lions in the divisional round, the Bucs fell just short in a 31-23 loss.\n\nLast season was Baker Mayfield's first year with Tampa Bay and he put up career-high numbers. Additionally, the team gave him a three-year, $100 million extension. They're invested in Mayfield being their QB1. Today, the NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported that the Bucs are signing one of Mayfield's former college teammates. Sterling Shepard is signing a one-year deal with the Bucs after eight seasons with the Giants.\n\nWith the 40th pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, the Giants selected WR Sterling Shepard out of Oklahoma. Early in his career, Shepard was a reliable target on offense. However, two of his last three seasons were filled with Shepard trying to return from injuries. In the 2021 and 2022 seasons combined, Shepard played in just 10 games. Many in the media expected the 2023 season to be Shepard's final year in the NFL. He played in 15 of New York's 17 games and made two starts.\n\nAdditionally, Shepard was given a fair-well treatment in his final home game with the Giants. All signs pointed to that being his final season. However, the 31-year-old must feel like he still has some gas left in the tank. Today, it was announced that the Buccaneers are signing Shepard to a one-year deal. Reuniting him with his former collegiate teammate, Baker Mayfield. They crossed paths at Oklahoma for one season in 2015.\n\nOklahoma's 2015 season was Mayfield's first year playing with the Sooners. It was Shepard's fourth and final season. As a senior, Shepard had 88 catches for 1,288 yards and 11 receiving touchdowns. Mayfield started 13 games for Oklahoma in 2015 and threw for 3,700 yards, 36 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. Now, the duo is renting with the Bucs. Baker Mayfield has bounced around in his career after getting drafted in 2018. Shepard played eight seasons with New York and this will be just the second team of his career. The Bucs already have Mike Evans and Chris Godwin as their top WR targets. However, Shepard is a solid-depth piece and already has a connection with Mayfield.

NFL reporter Mike Garafolo reported on Thursday that the team is signing veteran wideout Sterling Shepard, who most recently played for the New York Giants for the prior eight years. The signing is a one-year deal.\n\nShepard has shown flashes throughout his career, but he's faced some struggles as of late. He hasn't played a full season in the NFL in five years, with the last time he did so in 2018 coming during one of his best seasons -- he caught 66 passes for 872 yards in a 16-game season.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) -- Thieves apparently killed two Australians and an American on a surfing trip to Mexico in order to steal their truck because they wanted the tires, authorities said Sunday.\n\nBaja California state prosecutors released grisly details of the slayings, but have not yet officially confirmed the identification of the bodies. They said family members of the victims are viewing the bodies to see if they can be identified by sight.\n\nThe corpses were decomposing after the thieves dumped them into a remote well about 50 feet (15 meters) deep, some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed. If relatives can't identify the bodies, further tests will be conducted. The well also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\n\"The probability that it's them is very high,\" said chief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez, noting the corpses still appeared to be identifiable by sight. \"If they say that they are not completely certain that it is their relative, we would then have to carry out genetic testing.\"\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.\n\nBut Andrade Ram\u00edrez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nShe theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But \"when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nShe said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expats are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the case, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the case.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nRobinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.", "source": {"uri": "chatnewstoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHAT News Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well near the coast.\n\nThe well was located some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed, and also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\nThree suspects are being held in connection with the case, which locals said was solved far more quickly than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans.\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nShe theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But \"when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nShe said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nSurfers later performed a \"paddle-out\" ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean.\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the killings, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nRobinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston

They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well near the coast.\n\nThe well was located some 6 kilometres from where the foreigners were killed, and also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\nJake and Callum Robinson (left) were missing in Mexico along with their American friend, Jack Carter Rhoad but have now been identified by family.\n\nThree suspects are being held in connection with the case, which locals said was solved far more quickly than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans.\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nShe theorised the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tyres. But \"when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nShe said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nMexico's police officers stand guard at the Ensenada station in Ensenada, Mexico. Photo / AP\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found last week along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in a weekend editorial that \"the reality is, the dangers of travelling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore\".\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room\".\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surfboards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nSurfers later performed a \"paddle-out\" ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean.\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the killings, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamine. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas. Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nAustralian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and an American friend Jack Carter Rhoad failed to show up for an Airbnb booked in the Pacific resort of Rosarito.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nRobinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the US Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a US citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newstalkzb.co.nz", "name":

She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nAustralian Treasurer Jim Chalmers expressed sympathy for the Robinson family. \"I think the whole country's heart goes out to all of their loved ones. It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,\" he said at a news conference Monday in the capital, Canberra.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nSurfers later performed a \"paddle-out\" ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the killings, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nRobinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the US Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a US citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@manilatimes.net", "name":

They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well near the coast.\n\nThe well was located some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed, and also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\nThree suspects are being held in connection with the case, which locals said was solved far more quickly than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans.\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nShe theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But \"when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nShe said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nAustralian Treasurer Jim Chalmers expressed sympathy for the Robinson family. \"I think the whole country's heart goes out to all of their loved ones. It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,\" he said at a news conference Monday in the capital, Canberra.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nSurfers later performed a \"paddle-out\" ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean.\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the killings, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nRobinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They said family members of the victims are viewing the bodies to see if they can be identified by sight.\n\nThe corpses were decomposing after the thieves dumped them into a remote well about 50 feet (15 meters) deep, some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed. If relatives can't identify the bodies, further tests will be conducted. The well also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\n\"The probability that it's them is very high,\" said chief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez, noting the corpses still appeared to be identifiable by sight. \"If they say that they are not completely certain that it is their relative, we would then have to carry out genetic testing.\"\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.\n\nBut Andrade Ram\u00edrez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nShe theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But \"when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nShe said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expats are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf - we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the case, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the case.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nRobinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California - also known as the Sea of Cortez - from the Baja peninsula.

They said family members of the victims are viewing the bodies to see if they can be identified by sight.\n\nThe corpses were decomposing after the thieves dumped them into a remote well about 50 feet (15 meters) deep, some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed. If relatives can't identify the bodies, further tests will be conducted. The well also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\n\"The probability that it's them is very high,\" said chief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez, noting the corpses still appeared to be identifiable by sight. \"If they say that they are not completely certain that it is their relative, we would then have to carry out genetic testing.\"\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.\n\nBut Ms. Andrade Ram\u00edrez described the moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nShe said the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents, and wanted to steal their tires.\n\n\"The attackers drove by in their vehicle,\" said Ms. Andrade Ram\u00edrez. \"They approached, with the intention of stealing their vehicle and taking the tires and other parts to put them on the older-model pickup they were driving.\n\n\"When they [the foreigners] came up and caught them, surely, they resisted,\" she said. \"And these people, the assailants, took out a gun and first they killed the one who was putting up resistance against the vehicle theft, and then others came along and joined the fight to defend their property and their companion who had been attacked, and they killed them too.\"\n\nThe assailants then apparently burned the foreigners' tents.\n\nThe thieves then went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Ms. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Ms. Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expats are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nBut in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Ms. Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Ms. Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the case, some of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. On Friday, the office said the three had been arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if they might face more charges.\n\nAt least one of the suspects was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas.\n\nLast week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.\n\nMs. Robinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki",

If relatives can't identify them, further tests will be conducted. The well also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\nThe three men went missing last weekend during a camping and surfing trip, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada.\n\nBut Andrade Ramirez described the moments of terror that ended their trip.\n\nShe said the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents, and wanted to steal their tyres.\n\n\"Surely, they resisted,\" she said of the victims, and the thieves shot them to death.\n\nThe thieves then went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and dumped their bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with.\n\nShe said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of their thefts.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ramirez said.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tomas was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast.\n\nFrom their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expats are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial on Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of travelling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore\".\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the case. On Friday, the office said the three had been arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if they might face more charges.\n\nAt least one of the suspects was believed to have directly participated in the killings.\n\nLast week, the missing Australians' mother, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page an appeal for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodations in the nearby city of Rosarito.\n\nRobinson said one of her sons, Callum, was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the US Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that.\n\nThe US State Department said it was aware of reports of a US citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits.

feet (15 metres) deep in an \"advanced state of decomposition.\"\n\nAnother corpse found at the site had been there longer and was unconnected to the others, officials said.\n\nThe three surfers were

one of Mexico's most violent states because of organised crime gangs, is also known for its inviting beaches and the Ensenada area is considered among its safer parts.\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, it took weeks, months, or even years for action to be taken.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered on Sunday in Ensenada to pay their respects to the surfers and voice their anger over the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters.\n\nMany marched with their boards scrawled with messages, including \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\", \"no more deaths\" and \"Australia, we are with you\".", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,\" he said.\n\nThree suspects, two men and one woman, have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the case.\n\nOne of those arrested has a history of violence, drug dealing and robbery, officials said.\n\nInvestigators said earlier that the bodies were recovered from a well about 50 feet (15 metres) deep in an \"advanced state of decomposition.\"\n\nAnother corpse found at the site had been there longer and was unconnected to the others, officials said.\n\nThe three surfers were last seen on April 27 and reported missing a couple of days later, when authorities launched a multi-day search with the help from the US's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nBaja California, one of Mexico's most violent states because of organised crime gangs, is also known for its inviting beaches and the Ensenada area is considered among its safer parts.\n\nAt the news conference, Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, it took weeks, months, or even years for action to be taken.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. \"Every investigation is different,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered on Sunday in Ensenada to pay their respects to the surfers and voice their anger over the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters.\n\nMany marched with their boards scrawled with messages, including \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\", \"no more deaths\" and \"Australia, we are with you\".", "source": {"uri": "newsamericasnow.com", "dataType":

They have not contacted us since Saturday 27th April,\" she wrote, attaching a poster from friends desperate for news of their whereabouts.\n\nA missing poster shared on social media said Callum Robinson was 33 and his brother Jake was 30. It named their friend as Jack Carter Rhoad, aged 30.\n\nThe friends had previously visited Mexico several times without any problems, Andrade said.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram page showed several images from the trio's Mexico trip: enjoying beers with their feet up in a bar, lazing in a jacuzzi, eating roadside tacos, looking out at the surf.\n\nSix-foot-four (1.93 meters) Callum had played in the US Premier Lacrosse League, which left a message on its website saying the lacrosse world was \"heartbroken by the tragic loss\" of the trio.\n\n\"We offer our hearts, support and prayers to the Robinson and Rhoad Families, as well as all who loved Callum, Jake and Jack,\" it said.\n\nJake Robinson was a doctor in Perth, according to Australian media.\n\nBaja California is known for its inviting beaches, and its resorts are popular with US tourists, partly because of their proximity to the border.\n\nIt is also one of Mexico's most violent states because of organized crime gangs, although cartel activity doesn't commonly affect foreign tourists.\n\nDozens of surfers protested in Ensenada on Sunday with messages written on their boards including \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\" and \"no more deaths.\"\n\nThe case echoes that of two Australian surfers who were murdered and their bodies burned while traveling in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa in November 2015.\n\nCriminal violence in Mexico has claimed 450,000 lives and led to more than 100,000 disappearances since the end of 2006, when the government launched a controversial anti-drug strategy involving the military.", "source": {"uri": "channelstv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channels Television"}, "authors": [{"uri": "opeoluwani_akintayo@channelstv.com", "name": "Opeoluwani

But \"when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted,\" she added.\n\nThe prosecutor said that the relatives had viewed the bodies recovered from a remote well about 50 feet deep, and recognized them as their loved ones.\n\nThree suspects are being held in connection with the case.\n\nHere's everything we know so far.\n\nThe three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast, south of the city of Ensenada. They had been posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches before they went missing on 27 April.\n\nThe mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, had posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons after she had not heard from them. The friends had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada, but never showed up.\n\nProsecutor Andrade Ram\u00edrez said on Sunday that the site where the bodies were discovered, near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s, was a remote seaside area. Their missing tents and truck were found on Thursday along the coast.\n\n\"When they tried to get the vehicles, the victims opposed the robbery,\" she said. \"The robbers were armed with a firearm and then apparently shot the victims.\"\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and dumped the bodies into a well, they apparently were familiar with, and covered the hole with boards.\n\n\"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Ms Andrade Ram\u00edrez said. She aded that it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nA fourth body was found with the young men. It is believed to be the remains of a rancher who owned the property and went missing two weeks earlier. His death is not believed to be linked to the case, authorities said.\n\nMs Andrade Ram\u00edrez said investigators were not ruling out the possibility that the same suspects dumped the fourth body in the well as part of a previous crime.\n\nInvestigators announced that three Mexican citizens had been charged with a crime equivalent to kidnapping in connection with the tourists' disappearance.\n\nThey are Jes\u00fas Gerardo, whose alias is \"el Kekas\" is slang word that means \"quesadillas\"; his partner Ari Gisel Garc\u00eda Cota; and Jes\u00fas' brother, Cristian Alejandro Garcia. They have not been charged with murder.\n\nProsecutors said they were questioning three people in connection with the killings. Two of the suspects were also caught with methamphetamines.\n\nIn 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California -- also known as the Sea of Cortez -- from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.\n\nFrom the surfers' last social media posts, their trip looked picture perfect.\n\nBut even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial on Saturday that \"the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.\"\n\nRandy Dible, a San Diego photographer, and friend of Callum Robinson's recalled how he told him about his favorite surfing spot in Baja, La Bocana, and wrote out directions on a napkin, according to the New York Post.\n\nMr Dible said he almost tagged along on the trip but had to cancel when a last-minute job came in, Mr Dible toldThe Australian.\n\n\"I told him about this place because I'd been traveling down there all over that country for 30 years so I know it like the back of my hand and I knew just where to go,\" the friend said. \"And he was murdered in the exact same spot.\"\n\nHe said that he now regrets ever mentioning the surfing spot to Callum. \"I wish I'd never met up with him that day, I feel really bad. I feel guilty. It's just starting to hit home.\"\n\nAustralian Treasurer Jim Chalmers expressed sympathy for the Robinson family.\n\n\"I think the whole country's heart goes out to all of their loved ones. It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,\" he said at a news conference on Monday in the capital Canberra.\n\nJack Carter Rhoad, the American slain in Mexico, was just months away from marrying his fianc\u00e9e, Natalie Wiertz, when he joined the two Australian brothers for the surfing trip.\n\nA photo on Rhoad's Facebook page shows the moment the couple got engaged. They were set to get married on 17 August in Ohio, according to their wedding website.\n\nIn the wake of the murders, the couple's friend, Aubrey Byers, created a GoFundMe page for two purposes, she wrote.\n\n\"The first is to rally support for Natalie during this unimaginably difficult time and provide essentials such as housing, food, transportation, and more,\" the friend wrote.\n\n\"The second is to honor Carter by raising money for scholarships and donations he felt passionate about. No donation is too small, and every contribution is deeply appreciated.\"\n\nCallum Robinson's girlfriend, Emily Horwath, who lives in San Diego, revealed that her \"heart is shattered into a million pieces\" after his death.\n\n\"My heart is shattered into a million pieces,\" she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of her and Mr Robinson hugging.\n\n\"You are one of one. I will love you forever,\" she captioned another photo.\n\nA separate GoFundMe is dedicated to the Australian brothers.\n\n\"In the wake of the heartbreaking loss of Callum Robinson and Jake Robinson, our hearts ache with grief for their families, friends, and community. Their presence brought immeasurable joy, love, and kindness to those around them, leaving a mark on our lives,\" it reads.\n\n\"In honor of their memory and the support of their families, we've created this GoFundMe page to rally around Martin and Debra Robinson during this unimaginably difficult time. Your generosity will assist with essentials such as housing, food, transportation, and more. No donation is too small, and every contribution is deeply appreciated.\"\n\nThe brothers had attended the Coachella music festival before heading to Mexico to surf.\n\n\"Jake is such a gentle soul and would want no harm,\" his parents said in a statement. \"Our only comfort right now is that they were together doing something they passionately love.\n\n\"We ask people to keep them in their thoughts and prayers and to continue to respect our privacy at this distressing time.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Ms Andrade Ram\u00edrez was questioned by one reporter who commended the large and widespread search for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people often disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.\n\n\"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?' asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Every investigation is different,\" Ms Andrade Ram\u00edrez replied.\n\nDozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters.\n\n\"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.\n\nGabriela Acosta, a surfer who attended the protest, said she came \"to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.\" Ms Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.\n\n\"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,\" Ms Acosta said. \"But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.\"\n\n\"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,\" she said.\n\nA woman held up a sign that read: \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nSurfers later led a \"paddle-out\" ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean to pay their respects to the dead.", "source": {"uri":

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\n'Infectious spirit'\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\n'We need security'\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities said they were killed by low-level drug dealers who had been robbing motorists.\n\nThe latest suspected murders sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenda, where about 500 people marched on Sunday to call for justice and better security, Australian public broadcaster ABC reported.\n\n\"We are here in solidarity with our friends from Australia and the United States,\" local surfer H\u00e9ctor Estrada told the ABC.\n\n\"We are a big community of surfers all over the world and we need security, we need the beaches to be safe [for] camping around, surfing or just playing with your family, friends.\"\n\nAnother resident, Ana Acosta, told the ABC: \"I'm asking for justice and security from the government and for the state to provide to us surfers.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Mexico's Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences over the suspected killings.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" it said.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

State prosecutors have not officially confirmed the identities of the missing men, but have said the victims' family members are viewing the bodies to see if they can be identified by sight.\n\nThe corpses were found decomposing after the thieves dumped them into a remote well about 50 feet deep, some four miles from where the men were killed, authorities said. The well also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez said the probability that the corpses belong to the missing men is \"very high,\" noting that they still appeared to be identifiable by sight. \"If they say that they are not completely certain that it is their relative, we would then have to carry out genetic testing.\"\n\nUTAH HUNTER FINDS SKELETAL REMAINS OF MAN MISSING SINCE 2019 IN REMOTE MOUNTAINS\n\nThe three men, brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad, were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada when they went missing last weekend.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But \"when [the foreigners] came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nShe said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.\n\nThe thieves then allegedly went to what she called \"a site that is extremely hard to get to\" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a familiar well. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.\n\n\"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nMAN CONVICTED OF KIDNAPPING GIRLFRIEND, SUFFOCATING HER IN NEVADA DESERT\n\nThe thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.\n\nThe site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tom\u00e1s was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast.\n\nOn Sunday, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one placard carried by protesters. \"Australia, we are with you,\" one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration. A woman held up a sign that read \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nBaja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the case, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the case.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means \"quesadillas,\" or cheese tortillas.\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Officials had initially been waiting for DNA testing to confirm the remains found belonged to the surfers, but the victims' relatives were able to identify the bodies, Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe Australian victims were identified by the Mexican government as Jake and Callum Robinson and the American was identified as Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nThe FBI confirmed three bodies were found on Friday. Mexican officials said the bodies were found in a well that's more than 50 feet deep. A fourth body was found in the well, but authorities said they don't believe the final body is related to the missing surfers. The bodies were found in the town of Santa Tomas in the Mexican state of Baja California.\n\nThe missing Australians and their American friend were last seen in late April, officials said. Investigators examined the area where the surfers had been camping in Mexico. They found tent poles, a cartridge casing, plastic gallon bottles, blood stains and drag marks.\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez said it's believed the victims were attacked for their truck. She said the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents, and wanted to steal their tires.\n\n\"The attackers drove by in their vehicle,\" said Andrade Ram\u00edrez. \"They approached, with the intention of stealing their vehicle and taking the tires and other parts to put them on the older-model pickup they were driving.\n\n\"When they (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted,\" she said. \"And these people, the assailants, took out a gun and first they killed the one who was putting up resistance against the vehicle theft, and then others came along and joined the fight to defend their property and their companion who had been attacked, and they killed them too.\"\n\nThe assailants then apparently burned the foreigners' tents.\n\nJes\u00fas Gerardo, an alleged suspect in the case, is currently in prison while two others are in preventive detention as officials investigate the case further, authorities said. Jes\u00fas Gerardo, whose alias is \"el Kekas,\" has a criminal record.\n\nAuthorities have not ruled out the other two, a man and a woman who have not been identified, could be \"directly or indirectly related to this case,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said.\n\nThe Pacific coast state of Baja California is a popular tourist destination that is also plagued by cartel violence. The U.S. State Department warns Americans should reconsider travel to the region because of crime and kidnapping.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Australians' mother, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page an appeal for help finding her sons.

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\n'Infectious spirit'\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nThe bodies of Callum and Jake Robinson were found in a well in Baja California, Mexico. Callum Robinson/Instagram\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\nPhotos of the American and Australian surfers on a beach in Ensenada, Mexico on May 5, 2024. Karen Castaneda/AP\n\n'We need security'\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities said they were killed by low-level drug dealers who had been robbing motorists.\n\nThe latest suspected murders sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenda, where about 500 people marched on Sunday to call for justice and better security, Australian public broadcaster ABC reported.\n\n\"We are here in solidarity with our friends from Australia and the United States,\" local surfer H\u00e9ctor Estrada told the ABC.\n\n\"We are a big community of surfers all over the world and we need security, we need the beaches to be safe [for] camping around, surfing or just playing with your family, friends.\"\n\nA demonstrator holds photos of the surfers during a protest in Ensenada, Mexico, on May 5, 2024. Karen Castaneda/AP\n\nAnother resident, Ana Acosta, told the ABC: \"I'm asking for justice and security from the government and for the state to provide to us surfers.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Mexico's Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences over the suspected killings.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities said they were killed by low-level drug dealers who had been robbing motorists.\n\nThe latest suspected murders sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenda, where about 500 people marched on Sunday to call for justice and better security, Australian public broadcaster ABC reported.\n\n\"We are here in solidarity with our friends from Australia and the United States,\" local surfer H\u00e9ctor Estrada told the ABC.\n\n\"We are a big community of surfers all over the world and we need security, we need the beaches to be safe [for] camping around, surfing or just playing with your family, friends.\"\n\nAnother resident, Ana Acosta, told the ABC: \"I'm asking for justice and security from the government and for the state to provide to us surfers.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Mexico's Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences over the suspected killings.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" it said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They haven't contacted us since Saturday, April 27th,\" she stated, attaching a poster from friends desperate for information on their location.\n\nA missing notice on social media stated that Callum Robinson was 33 and his brother Jake was 30. It identified their companion as Jack Carter Rhoad, aged 30.\n\nAndrade stated that the companions had previously visited Mexico without any concerns.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram feed featured multiple photographs from the trio's Mexico trip, including them drinking beers with their feet up in a bar, relaxing in a jacuzzi, eating roadside tacos, and looking out at the surf.\n\nCallum, who stands six feet four (1.93 meters), played in the US Premier Lacrosse League, which published a comment on its website stating that the lacrosse community was \"heartbroken by the tragic loss\" of the trio.\n\n\"We offer our hearts, support and prayers to the Robinson and Rhoad Families, as well as all who loved Callum, Jake and Jack,\" it said.\n\nAustralian media said that Jake Robinson worked as a doctor in Perth.\n\nBaja California is famed for its appealing beaches, and its resorts are popular with US tourists, thanks to its closeness to the border.\n\nIt is also one of Mexico's most violent states due to organized crime organizations, while cartel violence rarely affects foreign visitors.\n\nOn Sunday, dozens of surfers protested in Ensenada, writing slogans on their boards that included \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\" and \"no more deaths.\"\n\nThe scenario is similar to that of two Australian surfers who were murdered and their remains burned while vacationing in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa in November 2015.\n\nSince the end of 2006, when the government initiated a contentious anti-drug strategy using the military, criminal violence in Mexico has killed 450,000 people and resulted in over 100,000 disappearances.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "How Africa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\n'Infectious spirit'\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\n'We need security'\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state.

It named their friend as Jack Carter Rhoad, aged 30.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram page showed several images from the trio's Mexico trip: enjoying beers with their feet up in a bar, lazing in a jacuzzi, eating roadside tacos, looking out at the surf.\n\nSix-foot-four (1.93 meters) Callum had played in the US Premier Lacrosse League, which left a message on its website saying the lacrosse world was \"heartbroken by the tragic loss\" of the trio.\n\n\"We offer our hearts, support and prayers to the Robinson and Rhoad Families, as well as all who loved Callum, Jake, and Jack,\" it said.\n\nJake Robinson was a doctor in Perth, according to Australian media.\n\nBaja California is known for its inviting beaches, and its resorts are popular with US tourists, partly because of their proximity to the border.\n\nIt is also one of Mexico's most violent states because of organized crime gangs, although cartel activity doesn't commonly affect foreign tourists.\n\nDozens of surfers protested in Ensenada on Sunday with messages written on their boards including \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\" and \"no more deaths.\"\n\nThe latest case echoes that of two Australian surfers who were murdered and their bodies burned while traveling in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa in November 2015.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"},

That body has not been identified and was apparently dumped in the well sometime before the three foreign tourists went missing.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez told a press conference on Sunday that the bodies identified as those of the three foreign tourists all had gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nAuthorities believe that the alleged killer or killers drove past the men's campsite, saw their tents and pickup truck and wanted to steal the vehicle for its tires and other parts.\n\n\"Surely they resisted,\" Andrade said, adding that it is believed that the men were subsequently shot and killed.\n\nShe noted that a range of evidence was found at the campsite, including a single bullet casing, blood stains, drag marks, tent poles and plastic bottles.\n\n\"This makes us think they were attacked and since then we doubted we'd find them alive,\" Andrade said.\n\nThe attorney general said that the aggressors disposed of the bodies in a well in a hard-to-get-to location some six to eight kilometers from the campsite.\n\n\"This is what happened,\" Andrade said, adding that the men weren't targeted because they were tourists but because they had a vehicle the aggressors wanted to steal.\n\n\"[The killers] probably didn't know the origin of these people,\" she said, although the pickup truck -- which was found burnt out on a ranch in nearby Santo Tom\u00e1s -- had license plates from the state of California.\n\nAndrade said that the parents of the victims understood that their sons, all aged in their early 30s, had gone into an \"inhospitable\" area where there was no way of calling for help.\n\nAuthorities have arrested two men and one woman in connection with the disappearance and alleged murder of Callum and Jake Robinson and Jack Carter Rhoad.\n\nAccording to media reports, they are Jes\u00fas Gerardo Garc\u00eda Cota, his brother Cristian Alejandro Garc\u00eda Cota and Ari Gisel, who has been identified as Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda's girlfriend. The woman was detained in possession of one of the deceased men's cell phones.\n\nAndrade said Sunday that Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Cota, known as \"El Kekas\" (a colloquial term for quesadillas), was detained on kidnapping charges. The attorney general said that he has a criminal record.\n\nShe noted that the other two suspects are in preventive detention on drug possession charges and said they could be directly or indirectly related to the alleged murder of the three foreign tourists.\n\n\"El Kekas\" had previously been convicted of extortion and vehicle theft in the municipality of Ensenada.\n\nAndrade said that the three people detained do not belong to a criminal group that \"controls\" territory in Ensenada.\n\nBaja California Governor Marina del Pilar called on \"the state's judicial power\" to apply the law with \"complete rigor against those responsible for these terrible events.\"\n\n\"Baja California is and will continue being a state with a safe tourism [experience] for the thousands of people who visit us from the rest of the country and the world,\" the governor added in a post on X.\n\nBaja California was Mexico's third most violent state last year in terms of total homicides, but killings of foreign tourists are rare.\n\nJake Robinson, a doctor, traveled to the United States in April to visit his brother Callum, who lived in San Diego and played professional lacrosse in the U.S.\n\nThey attended the Coachella music festival in California before traveling to Baja California with Rhoad, who lived in San Diego and worked as a director at the company ITCO Solutions, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\n\"I love people. I'm lucky to have found a 'job' that fuels my passion for problem-solving by connecting the right people with the right companies,\" Rhoad wrote on his LinkedIn page.\n\nJake Robinson had worked in regional hospitals around Australia and was to take up a new position in the city of Geelong on his return, according to his parents.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" the men's parents said in a statement.\n\n\"... Our only comfort right now is that they were together doing something they passionately love,\" said Martin and Debra Robinson, who traveled to Baja California from Perth to identify their sons and meet with authorities.\n\nDebra Robinson had posted in the Talk Baja Facebook group to seek assistance locating Callum and Jake last week.\n\n\"They have not contacted us since Saturday 27th April. They are traveling with another friend, an American citizen. They were due to book into an Airbnb in Rosarito after their camping weekend, but they did not show up,\" she wrote last Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement \"on behalf of Mexico,\" the Foreign Affairs Ministry (SRE) expressed its condolences \"for the tragic deaths of Australian citizens Jake and Callum Robinson and U.S. citizen Jack Carter Rhoad, who were vacationing in Baja California.\"\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry sympathizes with the families of the victims of this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome. Since their disappearance was reported, the Foreign Affairs Ministry has been in constant, direct contact with the Australian Ambassador to Mexico, Rachel Elizabeth Moseley, and her team to support their efforts,\" the SRE said.\n\n\"On the instructions of Foreign Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena Ibarra, Mexico's Ambassador to Australia, Ernesto C\u00e9spedes Oropeza, traveled to Baja California to provide consular assistance to the Australian embassy staff and to express Mexico's solidarity with the families of the youths,\" the ministry added.\n\nThe Baja California Surfing Association organized a \"march against insecurity\" at which surfers and others condemned the crime against the tourists from Australia and the United States and demanded security on the state's beaches.\n\nSurfers also participated in a \"paddle out\" tribute to the slain foreigners, who had enjoyed the waves off the Baja peninsula before their violent deaths.\n\n\"We're really, really sorry this happened. As local surfers from Baja California we're shaken to the core,\" Gino Passalacqua, vice president of the Baja Surf Club, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.", "source": {"uri":

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\n'Infectious spirit'\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\n'We need security'\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities said they were killed by low-level drug dealers who had been robbing motorists.\n\nThe latest suspected murders sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenda, where about 500 people marched on Sunday to call for justice and better security, Australian public broadcaster ABC reported.\n\n\"We are here in solidarity with our friends from Australia and the United States,\" local surfer H\u00e9ctor Estrada told the ABC.\n\n\"We are a big community of surfers all over the world and we need security, we need the beaches to be safe [for] camping around, surfing or just playing with your family, friends.\"\n\nAnother resident, Ana Acosta, told the ABC: \"I'm asking for justice and security from the government and for the state to provide to us surfers.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Mexico's Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences over the suspected killings.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" it said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Jose Alvarez, Sandi Sidhu, Fidel Gutierrez, David Shortell, Michael Rios and Chris Lau contributed reporting.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

inviting beaches, and its resorts are popular with US tourists, partly because of their proximity to the border.\n\nIt is also one of Mexico's most violent states because of organized crime gangs,

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\n'Infectious spirit'\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\n'We need security'\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities said they were killed by low-level drug dealers who had been robbing motorists.\n\nThe latest suspected murders sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenda, where about 500 people

They have not contacted us since Saturday 27th April,\" she wrote, attaching a poster from friends desperate for news of their whereabouts.\n\nA missing poster shared on social media said Callum Robinson was 33 and his brother Jake was 30. It named their friend as Jack Carter Rhoad, aged 30.\n\nCallum Robinson's Instagram page showed several images from the trio's Mexico trip: enjoying beers with their feet up in a bar, lazing in a jacuzzi, eating roadside tacos, looking out at the surf.\n\nSix-foot-four (1.93 meters) Callum had played in the US Premier Lacrosse League, which left a message on its website saying the lacrosse world was \"heartbroken by the tragic loss\" of the trio.\n\n\"We offer our hearts, support and prayers to the Robinson and Rhoad Families, as well as all who loved Callum, Jake, and Jack,\" it said.\n\nJake Robinson was a doctor in Perth, according to Australian media.\n\nBaja California is known for its inviting beaches, and its resorts are popular with US tourists, partly because of their proximity to the border.\n\nIt is also one of Mexico's most violent states because of organized crime gangs, although cartel activity doesn't commonly affect foreign tourists.\n\nDozens of surfers protested in Ensenada on Sunday with messages written on their boards including \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\" and \"no more deaths.\"\n\nThe latest case echoes that of two Australian surfers who were murdered and their bodies burned while traveling in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa in November 2015.\n\nCriminal violence in Mexico has claimed 450,000 lives and led to more than 100,000 disappearances since the end of 2006, when the government launched a controversial anti-drug strategy involving the military.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.my", "dataType": "news", "title":

One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" alias \"El Kekas.\"\n\nThe three friends were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29, and are believed to have been murdered, according to authorities.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez met with parents of the victims on Sunday and \"reaffirmed the institution's total commitment to continue the investigation into these unfortunate events until those responsible are fully prosecuted by the law,\" she said.\n\nThe surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery, officials said, citing preliminary investigations. Baja California has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada.\n\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found at a ranch in Santo Tomas, about 40 miles from where the bodies were found, a local police source told CNN. The vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\n\nThe confirmation of the surfers' deaths is heartbreaking news for desperate relatives who had flown to Mexico hoping for better news - and for their friends back home.\n\nJake Robinson, a 30-year-old doctor, had left Australia about two weeks ago for \"a trip of a lifetime\" with his brother, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News.\n\nThe siblings went to Coachella music festival a week before they crossed into Mexico with their American friend, planning \"to surf for a few days,\" parents Martin and Debra Robinson said last week.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" they said in a statement before departing Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCallum, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus. He was based in San Diego, California.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Maryland college said, \"Callum will be remembered for his infectious spirit and larger-than-life personality.\"\n\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" the post said. \"Though he may be gone, Callum's legacy will live on in our hearts forever.\"\n\nCallum's friend Hayley Jacobs told CNN affiliate Nine News that he \"lit up a room.\"\n\nShe said she saw him on the morning he left for Mexico, but quickly felt something was wrong when she didn't hear from him.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me, like something doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\nWhile parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nDrug cartels have terrorized the country with ever-increasing levels of violence and cruelty, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities said they were killed by low-level drug dealers who had been robbing motorists.\n\nThe latest suspected murders sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenda, where about 500 people marched on Sunday to call for justice and better security, Australian public broadcaster ABC reported.\n\n\"We are here in solidarity with our friends from Australia and the United States,\" local surfer H\u00e9ctor Estrada told the ABC.\n\n\"We are a big community of surfers all over the world and we need security, we need the beaches to be safe [for] camping around, surfing or just playing with your family, friends.\"\n\nAnother resident, Ana Acosta, told the ABC: \"I'm asking for justice and security from the government and for the state to provide to us surfers.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Mexico's Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences over the suspected killings.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" it said.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The fourth had been there as long as a month.\n\nPolice are currently investigating three Mexican nationals in connection with the case.\n\nTwo men and a woman have been detained on suspicion of direct or indirect involvement in the attack, the BBC reported.\n\nOne of the men has been charged with 'forced disappearance', or kidnapping.\n\nProtesters took to the streets of Ensenada, carrying surfboards with Spanish slogans on Sunday.\n\nOne said: 'They only wanted to surf - we demand safe beaches.'\n\nAnother said: 'Ensenada is a mass grave.'\n\nDozens of surfers gathered for a 'paddle-out' ceremony on the water as a vigil for the three murdered men.\n\nEnsenada is deemed relatively safe and has long been popular with tourists from California just to its north.\n\nBut Baja California is one of Mexico's most violent states, gripped by gang violence.\n\nThe risk of crime and kidnapping is so high, the US State Department advises Americans to reconsider travel there.\n\nHowever, prosecutor Andrade Ram\u00edrez refused to speculate on the involvement of organised crime, and whether the shots to the head were an execution.\n\nShe said: 'The investigation has only just begun.'\n\nThe FBI and Australian Federal Police are assisting Mexican authorities in the investigation.\n\nJake, who was about to start a new job as a doctor in Victoria, had been on 'the trip of a lifetime' to visit his brother Callum, who was living in the US.\n\nThey had visited Coachella music festival in the US before heading to Mexico to surf.\n\nTheir parents, Deborah and Martin Robinson, said: 'Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart.'\n\nCallum's girlfriend, Emily Horwath, said her heart was 'shattered into a million pieces', in an Instagram post with pictures of the couple.\n\nHis teammates at Stevenson University Lacrosse club, where he was chasing his dream of becoming a professional lacrosse player, called him larger than life.\n\nIn a statement, they said: 'With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' - warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand.'\n\nThere have been more than 30,000 murders a year in Mexico, for more than six consecutive years.\n\nLast year seven people were killed when a band of gunmen invaded a holiday resort in Mexican state of Guanajuato.\n\nThree men and three women as well as a seven-year-old child were gunned down at the La Palma resort in the small town of Cortazar.\n\nIn 2015, Australian surfers Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas were murdered in the Sinaloa region, next to Baja California, The Guardian reported.\n\nThey are believed to have been shot by gang members before their van and bodies were burnt.\n\nMORE : Woman arrested after five-month-old baby suffers

The bodies had been recovered from a remote well about 50 feet deep, authorities said.\n\nThe attorney general's office said the bodies, found in La Bocana, south of Ensenada, are those of Jake and Callum Robinson, of Australia, and Jack Carter Rhoad, of the U.S.\n\nAt least two of the three were believed to be living in San Diego, authorities said, according to NBC San Diego.\n\nThe Ensenada medical examiner's office said Friday the three victims were killed by gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, prosecutors said that the motive was carjacking and that the assailants may have been particularly focused on the wheels of the pickup truck used by the missing surfers.\n\nThe three were at a makeshift encampment during a fishing and surfing trip south of Ensenada, where the Baja coast rapidly becomes remote and filled with surprises for surfers seeking relatively rare rides.\n\nProsecutors said they found the trio's encampment, including tents, spent gun shells, bloodstains and marks indicating bodies had been dragged.\n\nThree people were being questioned in connection with the case, authorities said. Two of the three, a man and a woman, were held on methamphetamine-related allegations, they said, and the third was the subject of a kidnapping warrant.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez said previously there may be evidence, including a victim's cellphone in the possession of one of the three, that might connect the trio to the case.\n\nA fourth body was discovered with the three in the well and may be part of an unrelated case, authorities said.\n\nOn Sunday, Andrade Ram\u00edrez met with the three men's parents, her office said in its announcement identifying the bodies.\n\nShe reassured them, it said, that she was committed to ensuring those responsible face the full weight of the law.\n\nThe three men were considered missing on April 27 when they did not return to an Airbnb rental closer to the border, in Rosarito, Debra Robinson, the mother of Jake and Callum Robinson, said on Facebook.\n\nCartel and big-city street violence attributed to the drug trade in places like Tijuana has been seen as rare in the world of Baja tourism, which requires off-road-capable vehicles and the ability to start a campfire.\n\nThe peninsula's Pacific coast has been a staple destination for U.S. surfers for 60 years. but the U.S. State Department has more recently urged Americans to avoid Baja travel as cartel violence has spread.", "source":

Officials believe the tourists were attacked by three people who attempted to steal their truck. The incident has sparked protests in Ensenada, demanding safety for tourists and locals alike.\n\nThree men in their early 30s have been found dead in a well after being shot in the head while on a surfing trip in Baja California, Mexico.\n\nTwo Australian brothers, Callum and Jake Robinson, and their American friend, Jack Carter Rhoad, were near the popular coastal town of Ensenada when they went missing last week.\n\nTheir bodies were found in the 15-foot-deep well on Saturday after a dayslong search, and have since been identified by family members, Reuters reported.\n\nJake, 30, had flown to the US to visit Callum, 33, who was pursuing his dream of being a professional lacrosse player. The week after his trip, Jake was due to start a new job as a doctor in Victoria, Australia. Carter Rhoad, 30, was working as an apparel designer in San Diego, the New York Post reported.\n\nThey were last seen on 27 April and, when they didn't show up to an Airbnb booking a couple of days later, were reported missing and an investigation was launched by local authorities and the FBI.\n\nIt's thought that the tourists were attacked after they defended themselves from three people who were trying to steal their truck.\n\nBaja California state prosecutor Maria Andrade suggested that the attackers wanted the truck for its tires and shot the three men in their heads when they resisted, Reuters reported.\n\nA burnt-out vehicle suspected to be the surfers' truck was also found in the area, alongside abandoned tents, and a phone linked to them.\n\nThree Mexican nationals, two men and a woman, have been arrested as suspects.\n\nA fourth body was also found in the well, but it's believed to be older and from an earlier incident, the Guardian reported.\n\nTurf wars between drug gangs are common in Baja California, which is one of Mexico's most dangerous and violent states. However, Ensenada is generally considered to be safe -- about 75 miles south of California, it is a popular spot for US tourists.\n\nThe surfers' loved ones have paid tribute\n\nFriends and family of the Robinsons and Carter Rhoad have been sharing tributes to the young men.\n\n\"Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart,\" the brothers' parents said in a statement, the BBC reported.\n\nCallum's teammates from Stevenson University Lacrosse Club said in a statement on social media: \"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname 'big koala' -- warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand.\"\n\nHis girlfriend, Emily Horwath, said in an Instagram story that her heart was \"shattered into a million pieces.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Emily Horwath (@emily_livia)\n\n\"I don't have the words right now... I will love you forever,\" she wrote.\n\nProtesters and mourners took to the streets of Ensenada on Sunday to share their sadness and anger.\n\nThey marched with messages on surfboards, such as \"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches.\"\n\nSurfers also held a \"paddle out\" ocean vigil in memory of the Robinsons and Carter Rhoad.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

The bodies had been recovered from a remote well about 50 feet deep, authorities said.\n\n\"The Attorney General's Office of the State of Baja California confirms that the bodies found in the well in the area known as La Bocana, south of Ensenada, correspond to those of Jake and Callum Robinson, of Australian origin, as well as the American, Jack Carter,\" it said.\n\nAt least two of the three were believed to be living in San Diego, authorities said, according to NBC San Diego.\n\nThe Ensenada medical examiner's office said Friday the three victims were killed by gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nAt a Sunday news conference, prosecutors said the motive was carjacking, and the assailants may have been particularly focused on the wheels of the pickup used by the missing surfers.\n\nThe bodies were discovered Friday in a well in an area called La Bocana, authorities said.\n\nThe three were at a makeshift encampment during a fishing trip south of Ensenada, where the Baja coast rapidly becomes remote and filled with surprises for surfers seeking relatively rare rides.\n\nProsecutors said they found the trio's encampment, including tents, spent gun shells, blood stains, and marks indicating bodies were dragged.\n\nThree people were being questioned in connection with the case, authorities said. Two of the three, a man and woman, were held on suspicion of methamphetamine-related allegations, they said, and the fourth was the subject of a kidnapping warrant.\n\nChief state prosecutor Maria Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez said previously there may be evidence, including a victim's cell phone in the possession of one of the three, that may connect the trio to the case.\n\nA fourth body was discovered with the three in the well and may be part of an unrelated case, authorities said.\n\nOn Sunday, Andrade Ram\u00edrez met with the parents of the three men, her office said in its announcement that the bodies had been positively identified.\n\nShe reassured them, it said, that she was committed to ensuring those responsible face the full weight of the law, according to the statement.\n\nThe three men were considered missing on April 27 when they did not return to an Airbnb closer to the border, in Rosarito, the mother of Jake and Callum Robinson, Debra Robinson, said on Facebook.\n\nCartel and big-city street violence attributed to the drug trade in places like Tijuana has been seen as rare in the world of Baja tourism that requires off-road-capable vehicles and the ability to start a camp fire.\n\nThe peninsula's Pacific coast has been a staple destination for United States surfers for 60 years. but the U.S. State Department has more recently urged Americans to avoid Baja travel as cartel violence spread.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing",

REUTERS/Jorge Duenes\n\nBy Raul Cortes and Lizbeth Diaz\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican authorities on Sunday confirmed the American and two Australian tourists who went missing in northern Mexico last week are dead after their bodies were identified by parents.\n\nThe bodies of Australian brothers Callum, 33, and Jake Robinson, 30, as well as American Carter Rhoad, 30, were found at the bottom of a well in Baja California state earlier this week after a days-long search.\n\nThe three foreigners went missing while on a vacation surfing near the popular tourist town of Ensenada, about 90 minutes south of the U.S.-Mexico border on the Pacific coast.\n\nBaja California state Attorney General's Office said in a statement the confirmation was issued once the parents of the victims \"were able to identify them, without the need of genetic tests\".\n\nState Attorney General Elena Andrade told the parents and diplomatic officials that there was \"total institutional commitment to continue with the investigation of these unfortunate events until those responsible receive the full weight of the law\", the statement added.\n\nOn Saturday, Andrade said that the bodies were found in an advanced state of decomposition at the bottom of a well more than 15 meters (50 ft) deep.\n\nA source from the attorney general's office told Reuters that all three bodies had a shot in the head.\n\nAustralian Treasurer Jim Chalmers offered his condolences to the families of Callum and Jake and said the whole country mourned with them.\n\n\"We can only imagine what this ordeal has been like for them and for the loved ones of Callum and Jake,\" he said at a news conference.\n\n\"It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today.\"\n\nSHOT BY CAR THIEVES\n\nThree people have so far been arrested, officials say. A burnt-out vehicle believed to have been used by the three surfers was also found in the area.\n\nMexican authorities' preliminary hypothesis is that the arrested individuals attempted to carjack the foreigners and when the surfers resisted they were shot and their bodies dumped in a well.\n\nThe three surfers were last seen on April 27 and reported missing a couple of days later, when authorities launched a multi-day search with the help from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nBaja California is one of Mexico's most violent states, although the Ensenada area is considered safer. The U.S. State Department advises Americans to reconsider travel to the state due to crime and kidnapping.\n\n(Reporting by Raul Cortes and Lizbeth Diaz, additional reporting by Lewis Jackson in Sydney; Writing by Drazen Jorgic, editing by Deepa Babington and Michael Perry)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Their last images on social media showed them sitting and gazing at the waves, contemplating the breaks.\n\nWhat happened to end their lives may have been as random as a passing pickup truck full of people with ill intent. The surfers were shot in the head, their bodies dumped in a covered well miles away. How it unfolded was the stuff of nightmares.\n\nBrothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad had apparently stopped to surf the breaks at Punta San Jos\u00e9, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Ensenada. They were attacked there on April 28 or 29.\n\nAs soon as police arrived at their last known camp site, it was clear that something had gone violently wrong.\n\nThere were bloodstains and marks \"as if heavy objects had been dragged,\" leading to suspicions of an attack, the Baja California state prosecutor's office said in an attempt to reconstruct the scene.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez told a press conference on Sunday that the killers apparently drove by, saw the foreigners\u00b4 pickup truck and wanted to steal its tires and other parts.\n\nThe photos of the foreign surfers who disappeared are placed on the beach in Ensenada, Mexico, Sunday, May 5, 2024. Mexican authorities said Friday that three bodies were recovered in an area of Baja California near where two Australians and an American went missing last weekend during an apparent camping and surfing trip. (AP Photo/Karen Castaneda)\n\nSuch was the banality of evil, she said, that \"they were not attacked because they were tourists. ... The evidence suggests they (the killers) did not know where they were from.\"\n\nThe foreigners surely resisted, she said. \"And these people, the assailants, took out a gun, and first they killed the one who was putting up resistance against the vehicle theft, and then the other two came along and joined the fight to defend their property and their companion who had been attacked, and they killed them too.\"\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez said the reconstruction of events was based on the forensic examiner's reports, noting all three had bullet wounds to the head.\n\nThere was a hurried attempt to destroy evidence. The foreigners\u00b4 tents were apparently burned. The pickup truck was driven miles away and burned. The assailants' truck was later found with a gun inside.\n\nThen, at \"a site that is extremely hard to get to,\" the bodies were dumped into a well about 4 miles (6 kilometers) away. Investigators were surprised when, underneath the bodies of the three foreigners, a fourth body was found that had been there much longer.\n\n\"They had to have previous knowledge of it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said of the attackers, acknowledging the possibility they were behind the previous killing.\n\nThe well had been covered with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said. It took two hours to winch the bodies out.\n\nProsecutors have said they were questioning three people in the killings. Two were caught with methamphetamines. One of them, a woman, had one of the victims' cellphones when she was caught. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third man was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means quesadillas, or cheese tortillas.\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record that included drug dealing, vehicle theft and domestic violence, adding, \"We are certain that more people were involved.\"\n\nShe emphasized that she could not discuss anything related to the suspects, or their possible statements, because that was not allowed under Mexican law and might prejudice the case against them.\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez noted that the victims' families said the brothers and Rhoad had come many times to the seaside spot and never had any problem. This time, however, \"there was no way to ask for help when the attackers showed up.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

One person has been charged and two others are currently in police custody in connection with the men's deaths.\n\nAustralian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend Jack Carter Rhoad were found dead at the bottom of a 15-metre well about six kilometres away from their camping site. They had each been shot in the head, the State Attorney General's Office of Baja California said.\n\nThe three men had been camping and surfing together along the Baja coast in the municipality of Ensenada, about an hour and a half south of the U.S.-Mexico border, when they failed to show up at the Airbnb they had booked for the April 27-28 weekend.\n\nOn Thursday, Mexican officials announced they had found the men's campsite and were investigating \"other evidence\" at the location. Three people were brought in for questioning.\n\nDuring a Sunday news conference, Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez, the state's chief prosecutor, revealed that the surfers' tents were found burned to the ground and gun casings, blood stains and drag marks were present at the site, which led investigators to believe the victims had been attacked and their bodies moved.\n\nAfter an extensive search, investigators found a boarded-up well about six kilometres away from the campsite in an \"extremely\" remote area. Inside were four bodies: the three tourists who had gone missing, as well as a fourth, older body.\n\nThe three men's bodies had likely been in the well for five to seven days by the time they were found, according to NBC San Diego, citing a local medical examiner. The fourth body had been there much longer and may be from an unrelated homicide case, or could have been dumped there by the same people who killed the tourists.\n\nRam\u00edrez hypothesized that the three men were killed by armed robbers who wanted to steal the tires and other parts from their truck. She believes the attackers drove by the tourists' campsite, noticed their pickup truck and intended to steal parts to put on their own, older-model truck.\n\nThe men are believed to have fought back against the robbers, who then took out a firearm and shot them to death. In order to cover up the crime, the attackers disposed of the bodies in the nearby well and burned evidence.\n\nLocal media reported that parts stolen from the surfers' truck were found in another truck belonging to one of the suspects brought in by police.\n\nA man identified only as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N,\" who also goes by the alias \"El Kekas,\" a slang word for quesadillas, was charged with forced disappearance by state prosecutors before the men's bodies were identified. It's unclear if he will face upgraded charges now that the surfers have been confirmed dead. Mexican authorities only release the first names of people charged with crimes.\n\nJes\u00fas Gerardo has a prior criminal record, prosecutors said.\n\nTwo other people, a man and a woman, remain in police custody as investigators probe their involvement in the deaths. Both were arrested with methamphetamines in their possession.\n\nAll three suspects are Mexican nationals.\n\nMembers of the local surfing community in Ensenada gathered at the beach to pay respects to the three men who died.\n\n\"Ensenada is a mass grave,\" read one protester's poster.\n\n\"They only wanted to surf -- we demand safe beaches,\" another sign read.\n\nDozens of surfers paddled out into the ocean with flowers on their boards and formed a circle, before throwing the flowers into the waves as part of Sunday's vigil.\n\nBaja California is considered one of the most dangerous states in Mexico, despite the strong tourism industry there.\n\nThe federal government advises all Canadian travellers to exercise a \"high degree of caution in Mexico due to high levels of criminal activity and kidnapping.\" The advisory warns that border and rural areas often see the highest amount of criminal activity.\n\nIt's recommended that travellers stay in hotels and resorts with good security,

Mexico's homicide rate is among the highest in the world, and more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were found in a burned-out van in Sinaloa state.

Their remains were found near Ensenada in Baja California, near the US border.\n\nThe region is notorious for drug cartel killings but this violence rarely involves tourists. However, the latest murders raise fears over how safe Mexico is for holidaymakers.\n\nDanny Callaghan, CEO of the Latin American Travel Association (Lata), told : \"We were very saddened to hear of this incident and our thoughts are with the victims' families and loved ones.\n\n\"Whilst thousands of British travellers enjoy trouble-free trips to Mexico every year, we always advise checking the official Foreign Office advice and discussing your travel plans including specific areas and regions, with a reputable Lata tour operator prior to booking.\"\n\nDozens of surfers protested near where the victims' bodies were found on Sunday with messages written on their boards including \"beaches, security, freedom, peace\" and \"no more deaths\".\n\nPaulina Rodriguez, a Mexican surfer who took part in demonstrations calling for an end to the killings, paid homage to the trio.\n\n\"Normally it is only women who are scared to go surfing alone but this case shows that we are all vulnerable, that this kind of thing can happen to any of us,\" she told from Baja California.\n\nThe case echoes that of two Australian surfers who were murdered, and their bodies burned while travelling in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa in November 2015.\n\nIn June, British woman Sophie Wiggins, 32, was seriously injured in Mexico after robbers broke into her jungle ranch and shot her and killed her Polish partner in the resort of Playa del Carmen.\n\nThe latest shootings come amid increasing concern that Mexico is in the grip of escalating drug gang violence.\n\nThe Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office has a list of advice for British tourists travelling to Mexico. \"Crime in Mexico can pose a risk for foreigners, particularly in major cities and tourist resorts where street crime is a serious issue,\" it says.\n\nFor decades, Mexico has been plagued by violence linked to drug cartels. Since 2006, 450,000 people have been killed and an estimated 100,000 disappeared, according to government statistics.\n\nNorthern Baja California, where the three surfers were killed, has one of the highest murder rates in Mexico, with between 50-100 killings per 100,000 people, according to a 2023 Mexican Citizen Council for Public Security and Justice report.\n\nMarina del Pinar, the state governor of Baja California, said in a statement to that despite the killings, the region was safe for tourists.\n\n\"Baja California is and will continue to be a secure place for people to visit from our country and from all over the world,\" she said.\n\nTwo men and a woman have been detained on suspicion of involvement in the case, said Mexican prosecutors. They were named by Mexican media as Jesus Gerardo aka \"El Kekas\", his girlfriend Ari Gisel, and his brother.\n\nOne of those arrested has a history of violence, drug dealing and robbery, officials said. The woman is facing drug charges.\n\nInvestigators said the bodies were recovered from a clifftop shaft in an \"advanced state of decomposition\". Another corpse found at the site had been there longer and was unconnected to the others, officials said.\n\nThe friends had previously visited Mexico several times without any problems, said chief state prosecutor Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez.\n\nJake was a doctor, while Callum played in the US Premier Lacrosse League, which said the lacrosse world was \"heartbroken by the tragic loss\" of the

Relatives of American Jack Carter Rhoad and Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson were able to positively identify the bodies without resorting to genetic tests, as stated by the Baja California Attorney General's office in a Sunday statement.\n\nFollowing the grim discovery, three Mexican citizens, previously questioned in connection with the tourists' disappearance, have been apprehended on suspicion of kidnapping, as announced by the attorney general's office. Among the suspects, one was identified as Jesus Gerardo \"N,\" also known as \"El Kekas,\" according to CNN. The trio of friends vanished on April 29 while on a surfing and camping expedition near the town of Ensenada, approximately 60 miles south of Tijuana. Authorities believe they were victims of murder.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez convened with the victims' parents on Sunday, reaffirming the institution's unwavering commitment to pursue the investigation until those accountable face full prosecution under the law. Authorities suggested that the surfers may have been targeted in an attempted vehicle robbery, citing preliminary probes. While Baja California has seen its share of cartel violence in recent years, such incidents are rare in tourist hubs like Ensenada.\n\nA charred white pickup truck, matching the one Callum Robinson had shared on Instagram a week before their disappearance, was discovered at a ranch in Santo Tomas, approximately 40 miles from the well where the bodies were found, revealed a local police source to CNN. Expressing condolences, Mexico's Foreign Ministry released a statement on Sunday, standing in solidarity with the victims' families and lamenting the tragic turn of events.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" the statement read. While certain regions of Mexico remain popular tourist destinations, the nation grapples with pervasive violent crimes, including kidnapping and human trafficking, particularly in border areas.

Baja California prosecutors believe the suspects shot the tourists because they wanted the tires from the vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsenada, near where the bodies were found, is about 75 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border. It has been an attractive location for surfers because of its waves and has been considered safer for tourists.\n\nViolence in Baja California has increased as local drug gangs fight for turf control but has remained popular among tourists.\n\nRead More Police arrest suspect after home of LA Mayor Karen Bass broken into Colombian extradited to Florida for kidnapping U.S. soldiers Man gets 47 years

Among the suspects, one was identified as Jesus Gerardo \"N,\" also known as \"El Kekas,\" according to CNN.\n\nThe trio of friends vanished on April 29 while on a surfing and camping expedition near the town of Ensenada, approximately 60 miles south of Tijuana. Authorities believe they were victims of murder.\n\nBaja California Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez convened with the victims' parents on Sunday, reaffirming the institution's unwavering commitment to pursue the investigation until those accountable face full prosecution under the law.\n\nAuthorities suggested that the surfers may have been targeted in an attempted vehicle robbery, citing preliminary probes. While Baja California has seen its share of cartel violence in recent years, such incidents are rare in tourist hubs like Ensenada.\n\nA charred white pickup truck, matching the one Callum Robinson had shared on Instagram a week before their disappearance, was discovered at a ranch in Santo Tomas, approximately 40 miles from the well where the bodies were found, revealed a local police source to CNN.\n\nExpressing condolences, Mexico's Foreign Ministry released a statement on Sunday, standing in solidarity with the victims' families and lamenting the tragic turn of events.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" the statement read.\n\nWhile certain regions of Mexico remain popular tourist destinations, the nation grapples with pervasive violent crimes, including kidnapping and human trafficking, particularly in border areas.

Callum and Jake Robinson (pictured) and their American mate Jack Carter Rhoad were last seen on April 27 in the Mexican province of Baja California. Mexican authorities said bandits attacked the three to steal the tyres off their truck before killing them all and dumping their bodies in a disused well. But the style of the slayings - a single gunshot to the head - has sparked fears locally about the possible involvement of drug cartels, which are rife in the region.\n\nThe shock new details emerged as Callum and Jake's grieving parents performed the grim task of identifying their bodies on Sunday local time. The Baja California Forensic Medical Service released the autopsy results as heartbreaking footage emerged of the Aussies' parents leaving Ensenada Forensics Lab after identifying Callum's and Jake's bodies. Three Mexicans have already been arrested over the deaths but authorities are not ruling out further accomplices with possible links to organised crime. 'We cannot rule out the possibility that there are additional individuals who were involved in this incident,' local Attorney-General Mar\u00eda Andrade Ram\u00edrez said. She added that the victims 'all have a hole in their head made by a firearm projectile'.\n\nHundreds of people marched through the nearby town of Ensenada on Sunday afternoon, demanding greater security measures amid a welter of cartel-fuelled violence. Some held surfboards emblazoned with messages written in Spanish, including 'Australia, we are with you' and 'They only wanted to surf, and they executed them', according to the ABC . Baja California is one of Mexico's most violent states, with the US State Department advising Americans to reconsider travel there due to crime and kidnapping. Tijuana, 100km north of where the three surfers were found and close to the US border, is plagued by violence and has the most homicides of any city in Mexico.\n\nWith a population of more than two million, it regularly has around 2,000 murders a year. By comparison, Houston, Texas, which has a similar population, saw 435 killings in 2022, according to Associated Press. In December last year, furious drug lords hunted down corrupt officers who allegedly stole a drug shipment. The revenge hits led to the deaths of at least five officers. It is believed the region is riven by turf battles between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, in addition to other groups. In June last year, the city's mayor, Montserrat Caballero, announced she had decided to live at an army base for her own safety after receiving threats.\n\nEarlier, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Callum's devastated girlfriend Emily Horwath (pictured) shared a heartfelt tribute on social media. 'You are one of one,' she captioned a photo of the couple sharing a kiss. 'I will love you forever.' She also posted an Instagram story which said: 'My heart is shattered into a million pieces, I don't have the words right now.' 'This world lost one of its kindest, silliest and most genuine of souls this week. Rest easy. I miss you.'\n\nThe US-based couple had travelled from their home in San Diego to Australia over Christmas and New Year, and shared photographs from Melbourne and Perth . The three men had been on a surfing trip down Mexico's west coast. The three men were about 90 minutes' drive south of the US-Mexico border when they disappeared just a few days into the trip. In social media posts shared by Callum just before they vanished, the trio was seen relaxing at Rosarito Beach, where they were said to be surfing and camping as they moved up and down Mexico's west coast.\n\nThey reportedly planned to move on to Ensenada, about 50 miles (80km) down the coast, but concerns were raised when they failed to check into an Airbnb on Sunday. Police said they found three abandoned tents south of Ensenada, which were splattered with blood, according to local media. The brothers' mother issued a desperate plea on social media after the group failed to turn up at an Airbnb they had booked in Rosarito. Mexican authorities also found shell casings at the campsite where the three men were last seen with further investigations leading them to the well about 2km away. Pictyred: Carter Rhoad.\n\nThree bodies, as well as a fourth body believed to be a local rancher, were discovered on Saturday in the clifftop well overlooking the ocean. It is believed the rancher's body had been there for much longer and his death is not believed to be linked to the three young men. It took rescuers up to 20 hours to pull the bodies out of the well, with p hysical characteristics, including hair and clothes, matching the three men. It comes as Attorney-General Mar\u00eda Andrade Ram\u00edrez said the murder investigation would probe whether the men were killed in an attempted robbery. She said the thieves were likely interested in the mens' truck, a white Chevrolet Colorado pickup, and more specifically in the tyres. 'The probability that it's them is very high,' Andrade Ram\u00edrez said. 'When they tried to get the vehicle, the victims opposed the robbery, the robbers were armed with a firearm and apparently shot the victims.'\n\nMs Ramirez added that the victims 'all have a hole in their head made by a firearm projectile'. Three Mexicans, Jesus Gerardo Garcia Cota, alias El Kekas, his girlfriend, Ari Gisel Garcia Cota (Pictured), and his brother, Christian Alejandro Garcia, were arrested on Wednesday and charged with forced kidnapping. Ms Garc\u00eda Cota, 23, reportedly had one of the missing men's mobile phones. It is understood police were able to make the arrests after one of the brothers' mobile phones was turned back on, and pinged a local mobile tower. All three suspects were found in possession of an assortment of methamphetamines and other illegal drugs, according to local outlets Zeta and Talk Baja.\n\nBaja California, where the men shared their vacation snaps, is known as one of Mexico's most violent, cartel-controlled states. The Robinson brothers had attended Coachella before going to Mexico to surf. Callum was based in the U.S. where he was an accomplished lacrosse player known as 'the Big Koala', and his brother Jake, who worked in regional hospitals across Australia, had flown out to San Diego two weeks ago to visit him. Rhoad worked in technology services in San Diego.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Among the suspects, one was identified as Jesus Gerardo \"N,\" also known as \"El Kekas,\" according to CNN.\n\nThe trio of friends vanished on April 29 while on a surfing and camping expedition near the town of Ensenada, approximately 60 miles south of Tijuana.

While Baja California has seen its share of cartel violence in recent years, such incidents are rare in tourist hubs like Ensenada.\n\nA charred white pickup truck, matching the one Callum Robinson had shared on Instagram a week before their disappearance, was discovered at a ranch in Santo Tomas, approximately 40 miles from the well where the bodies were found, revealed a local police source to CNN.\n\nExpressing condolences, Mexico's Foreign Ministry released a statement on Sunday, standing in solidarity with the victims' families and lamenting the tragic turn of events.\n\n\"The Foreign Ministry stands in solidarity with the families of the victims in this tragic event and deeply regrets the outcome of the events,\" the statement read.\n\nWhile certain regions of Mexico remain popular tourist destinations, the nation grapples with pervasive violent crimes, including kidnapping and human trafficking, particularly in border areas. Mexico's homicide rate ranks among the highest globally, with over 100,000 people still missing.\n\nIn a similar incident in 2015, the bodies of Australian surfers Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were discovered in a burnt-out van in Sinaloa state. Authorities attributed their deaths to low-level drug dealers engaged in robbery of motorists, CNN reported.

He was accompanied by Australian brothers Callum Robinson, 30, and Jake Robinson, 33.\n\nCallum Robinson resided near San Diego while Jake Robinson was in the U.S. visiting him.\n\nThe bodies were discovered in the well in a remote area near the city of Ensenada near the Mexican Pacific coast several days ago.\n\nThey were positively identified Sunday evening, KGTV reported.\n\nFamily members of all three men traveled south of the border to help police identify the bodies, according to 9News Australia.\n\nThe fourth body in the well had been placed lower than those of the missing surfers and it is not believed to be connected with the triple homicide.\n\nBaja California State Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez told reporters the men were all shot to death by thieves who were apparently attempting to steal the tires from a pickup truck they had been traveling in.\n\nThere were signs that the three surfers confronted the would-be thieves before shots were fired at them.\n\nEach of the victims had been shot in the head.\n\nShell casings, blood stains, and a burned-out tent were discovered at a temporary camp the men had set up.\n\nThey had been staying in a nearby Airbnb and were in Mexico to surf and to celebrate a birthday.\n\nRamirez said it is not believed drug cartels were involved in the slayings. Two men and one woman were in custody on Sunday evening and were all expected to be charged with murder, 9News Australia reported.\n\nThe names of those arrested have not been released to the public but one of the men was initially charged with the forced disappearance of people, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAs of Monday morning, it wasn't clear what -- if anything -- the other two people being held in connection with the deaths had been charged with.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, Ramirez said she does not believe the men were targeted because they were foreign to Mexico but because their white Chevrolet Colorado truck - which was also burned - presented would-be thieves with an opportunity.\n\n\"It was not an attack [on them] as tourists,\" Ramirez said. \"It was in the capacity of stealing a vehicle.\"\n\nThe FBI is assisting Mexican authorities in their ongoing investigation.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "johnathan_jones@westernjournal.com", "name": "Johnathan Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGTV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KGTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Callum Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUSA_(TV)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KUSA (TV)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada,_Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Colorado", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Colorado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bodies-found-for-may-6-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541608", "eventUri": "eng-9541608", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 262, "textEnd": 270}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The Baja California Forensic Medical Service revealed that all three died from a gunshot to the head.\n\nThree men are still in custody over their disappearance. One of them had already been charged with \"forced disappearance\" while the other two are still detained, according to ABC News (Australia).\n\nThe three tourists were surfing in the well-known surf spot of Ensenada, Baja California in Mexico's northwest. Their deaths led to members of the surfing community there, both foreign and local, taking to the streets to demand improved security in the area.\n\nAround 500 people were marching around Ensenada were marching in protest while chanting in Spanish, \"We want security.\" Some of the protesters were holding surfboards with messages including \"Australia, we are with you\" and \"They only wanted to surf, and they executed them.\"\n\n\"We are here in solidarity with our friends from Australia and the United States,\" said local surfer H\u00e9ctor Estrada. \"We are a big community of surfers all over the world and we need security, we need the beaches to be safe [for] camping around, surfing, or just playing with your family, friends.\"\n\nBaja California authorities are calling the incident a \"robbery gone wrong\" as the robbers just wanted to steal the truck the three were riding on to steal their tires.

They then dumped their bodies into a well before covering it up with boards.\n\nAs to why the robbery attempt went wrong, Andrade Ram\u00edrez noted that the victims may have resisted and this led the robbers to resort to violence.\n\n\"When they (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted,\" she told reporters. \"And these people, the assailants, took out a gun and first they killed the one who was putting up resistance against the vehicle theft, and then others came along and joined the fight to defend their property and their companion who had been attacked, and they killed them too.\"\n\nShe added that the killers might have been looking for trucks. \"They may have been looking for trucks in this area,\" she said.

'I couldn't tell you the number due to secrecy at this time.'\n\nThe attorney general's remarks were made just a day after the families identified the bodies of the surfers.\n\nMar\u00eda Andrade, the attorney general for the Pacific coast Mexican state of Baja California, revealed Monday in an interview with Milenio news that authorities have zeroed in on additional suspects linked to the murder of two Australian and one American surfer\n\nAustralian natives Callum and Jake Robison were shot dead along with their California friend Carter Rhoad last week in Baja California, Mexico\n\n30-year-old Californian Jack Carter Rhoad was set to marry his fianc\u00e9e this summer\n\nThe style of the executions have sparked fears locally about the possible involvement of drug cartels which are rife in the region (pictured: the trio's vehicle was later found burnt-out in the Santo Tom\u00e1s area)\n\nTheir bodies were recovered Friday from a 50 feet deep well near La Bocana Beach, in Santo Tom\u00e1s, a town in the municipality of Ensenada Each of the victims had bullet wounds on their heads, according to law enforcement.\n\nJes\u00fas 'El Kekas' Garc\u00eda, his wife Ari Garc\u00eda, and his brother Cristian Garc\u00eda, were arrested in an operation Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities were able to make the arrests after one the Robison brothers' cell phones was turned on and pinged a local mobile tower.\n\nAll three suspects were found in possession of an assortment of methamphetamines and other illegal drugs.\n\nA rescue worker descends into a waterhole where human remains of two Australians and an American were found near La Bocana Beach\n\nThe families of Aussie siblings Callum and Jake Robinson confirmed their bodies Sunday\n\nCarter Rhoad had visited Mexico throughout his adult life after volunteering for a medical mission in Guatemala at 19\n\nThe Robinson siblings and Rhoad, who was slated to be married this summer to his fianc\u00e9e Natalie Wiertz, 32, were supposed to check into an Airbnb in Rosario Beach last weekend after they spent a couple of days camping at La Bocana Beach and last contacted their families April 27.\n\nAndrade said the suspects targeted the surfers because they wanted to steal the pickup truck's tires.\n\nThe state prosecutors said that one of the victims got into a struggle with one of the three suspects, who shot him before gunning down the two other men. Their pickup truck was found burned nearby.\n\nAndrade said that the fact that they were in an uninhabited area made them an easy target.\n\nBrothers Jes\u00fas Garcia Cota and Cristian Garc\u00eda were two of the three arrested. It is unclear which brother is which in their mugshots\n\nAri Garc\u00eda, 23, is one of three suspects arrested. She is reportedly the partner of Jes\u00fas Garcia, who was also arrested\n\nHundreds of people marched through the nearby town of Ensenada on Sunday afternoon, demanding greater security measures amid a welter of cartel-fueled violence (pictured)\n\n'It is a totally remote unpopulated place. There is no communication, no networks, no telephone communication for at least two and a half hours, three inwards,' she explained. 'So, they were very vulnerable.\n\n'The aggressors knew that they could not ask for help and that in order to later report the theft of the vehicle, it would take them more than three hours to reach (people) or where they could ask for help.\n\n'They saw the opportunity that made it easier for them to commit the crime and that is how they tried to steal the vehicle,' Andrade added. 'There was resistance on the part of one of the young men and later they shot him and later the other two were already upset and also scared by what had happened and what had happened to the first of them and they also tried to defend themselves.\n\n'However, these suspects had a firearm.'\n\nAndrade also denied various reports that indicated that the three men had been beaten by the suspects.\n\nWhile some people doubted the robbery motive and suggested it may have been cartel-related, the attorney general stressed all along that the alleged killers were interested in stealing the pickup truck's tires.\n\nIt is believed the region is riven by turf battles between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, in addition to other groups.\n\nIn June last year, the city's mayor, Montserrat Caballero, announced she had decided to live at an army base for her own safety after receiving threats.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

If you consent to cookies being set by third-party service providers and that personal data is therefore transferred to third-party service providers, you can allow all cookies and view external content directly.\n\nThe search for two Australian brothers missing in Mexico and their American friend has come to a sad end. After the bodies were found, prosecutors in the state of Baja California believe that the three men, who were on a surfing trip, were shot by thieves who were pursuing their car - especially its tires. Authorities announced on Sunday (local time) that relatives of the missing had identified the dead.\n\nAccording to information, the bodies were already in a state of decomposition after the thieves threw them into a remote well about 15 meters deep. There was also a fourth body in the well, which was said to have been lying there for a long time. \"The possibility that it is them is very high,\" prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez said before the identification was made.\n\nThe three men suddenly disappeared during a camping and surfing trip last week. From their trip, they posted idyllic photos of the waves and remote beaches along the coast south of Ensenada on social media.\n\nAndrade Ramirez described how the journey of Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and American Jack Carter Rudd came to a horrific end. The subsequent killers drove up, saw the trio's pickup truck and tents and decided to steal the tires. \"They definitely defended themselves,\" she said of the victims shot by the robbers.\n\nThe criminals then went to the site where the bodies were found, which was \"extremely difficult to access\" - and threw them into a well, which they apparently knew about in advance. Andrade Ramirez said investigators do not rule out that the suspects may have dumped the other body there. \"It's possible they were looking for trucks in this area.\"\n\nThe site where the bodies were found near the city of Santo Tomas is not far from where the missing people's tents and cars were found on Thursday. The men's recent social media posts gave the impression of a perfect trip. But even experienced Mexico expats doubt whether camping on the largely deserted coast is still safe.", "source": {"uri": "thewestonforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspetuck News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esmond_barker@thewestonforum.com", "name": "Esmond Barker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gast\u00f3n_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada,_Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Carter_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Carter (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expatriate"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Callum Robinson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/EzaJDbQaqG482YS1rcWaUy.jpg?op=ocroped&val=1200,1200,1000,749,249,0&sum=l1AydyjkbBk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541608", "eventUri": "eng-9541608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

As local surfers from Baha California, we're shaken to the core,\" Baha Surf Club vice president Gino Passalacqua said\n\nAnother local surfer told 7NEWS: \"We ask for security, we ask for justice for these (people).\"\n\nAbout 150 people also gathered for a vigil in San Diego, where Callum lived, according to reports.\n\nThe Robinson brothers were in northern Mexico on a surfing holiday when they failed to check into pre-arranged accommodation near the city of Ensenada.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said the situation was incredibly sad for family and friends.\n\n\"Everyone from Western Australia is hurting as we hear from more aspects of this story, the violence they were exposed to and of course the loss of life,\" he said.\n\nCallum was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and Lacrosse Australia said its thoughts were with the loved ones of all three victims.\n\nCallum also played lacrosse at Maryland's Stevenson University and former coach Paul Cantabene said he got along with everyone while being \"big, fast, rigid and flat-out just good\" on the playing field.\n\nJake, a doctor, had ventured overseas to join his brother on the \"trip of a lifetime\".\n\nTheir family travelled to Baja California state in northern Mexico and were taken to view two bodies found at the bottom of a well on a cliff top on Baja Peninsula on Mexico's west coast.\n\nThieves are understood to have killed the three men to steal their truck because they wanted the tyres and then allegedly got rid of the bodies about 6km away.\n\nMexican authorities' preliminary hypothesis is that the surfers resisted being hijacked.\n\nThree suspects are being held in connection with the case, which some locals say authorities had worked to solve far quicker than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans.\n\nA criminal charge of forced disappearance, equivalent to kidnapping, was laid against one of the three on Saturday.\n\nThe chief state prosecutor's office said evidence found along with abandoned tents at a burnt-out campsite was linked to the three people being questioned.\n\nMedia reported a fourth body found in the well was believed to be that of the property's missing owner.",

A memorial paddle-out was held at Playa San Miguel, in addition to calls for justice and increased safety measures.\n\nAustralian brothers Callum (33) and Jake Robinson (30), and American Jack Carter Rhoad (30), were killed while camping at La Bocana, a rural site south of Ensenada. Their bodies were found dumped in a nearby well, and their identities were later confirmed by their families. The cause of death for each was gunshot wounds. Local authorities believe thieves had attempted to steal the tires from their truck, which was found burnt out on a ranch in the area. Three suspects are in custody, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMeanwhile, the surf community worldwide is in mourning; and during the demonstrations over the weekend, locals expressed their sadness surrounding the situation, memories of the deceased in the days prior, and demands for action.\n\nHere's a handful of statements from local northern Baja surfers:\n\n\"The unfortunate, horrible events that happened to these three guys, we can all relate,\" said David Kamena, an America living in northern Baja. \"All of us know that camp spot really well. So, this hits home to us. We're calling to the government for more security. It happens every day all over the world, including the US. But we're standing up, and saying we don't like it.\"\n\n\"This horror story happened to some good people, who in their short stay on the beaches of Ensenada left among those of us who had the opportunity to talk with them a great pleasure of meeting people from another world, admired by our country, wanting to listen to traditional music, eat tacos and surf,\" said Beatriz Ibarra, a local surfer with a Master of Science degree. \"Today it was them, yesterday it was others, tomorrow we don't want it to be us. We will continue fighting for a Baja California with decent and safe access and space to all beaches.\"\n\n\"These young men - Callum Robinson, Jake Robinson, and Jack Carter Rhoad - surfed together with a group of us Mexican surfers in the morning at Playa San Miguel, Ensenada B.C.\" remembered Miguel Alc\u00e1zar Sr. \"They were very happy, educated, kind and gentle people. We shared waves and anecdotes.\"\n\nAlc\u00e1zar Sr. continued:\n\n\"Without a doubt Carter was very happy in Playa San Miguel. First, he had a hard time standing on his board and he fell. Callum and Jake were laughing at him and since Carter was just laughing, I approached him and said, 'Can I give you a tip? When you catch the wave and stand up, stay low...' He tried twice and he did it! His friends and I cheered and applauded him. He was still surfing and turned to look at me and he had a face of surprise and happiness.

We love them so much and this breaks our heart.\"\n\nOn Sunday evening Mexico time, local surfing communities gathered to honour the memory of the deceased with a 'paddle out' vigil in the seaside community of San Miguel.\n\nThe vigil included placing flowers on surfboards and paddling out to sea, reflecting the surfing tradition of commemorating fallen comrades.\n\nGino Passalacqua, the vice-president of the Baja Surf Club, said the killings have shattered the community.\n\n\"I'm just shaken to my core,\" he said.\n\nSurfer Phil Brown, who spends four months a year in the area, said he's been pondering how safe the area is in the wake of the tragic event.\n\n\"And that's what's scary is ... did I just get really lucky or did they just get very unlucky?\" he said.\n\nAnother held a sign demanding safer and more accessible beaches in the area.\n\nIn posts on social media, Callum Robinson's partner Emily Horwath shared a series of tributes to her boyfriend from loved ones over the past two days.\n\n\"I'd give anything for one more koala hug,\" she wrote in one post.\n\n\"My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I don't have the words right now.\"\n\nCallum's university team Stevenson University Lacrosse claimed in a social media post the pair had been killed.\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of the passing of our dear teammate and friend, Callum Robinson,\" the club said.\n\n\"From his days leading us to victory on the field to his unwavering commitment to academic excellence, Callum was a true inspiration to us all.\"The club said Callum had played a pivotal role in the team's Division III National Championship in 2013, and had amassed \"equally impressive academic achievements\".\n\nThree suspects arrested as investigation continues\n\nEarlier on Monday, Baja California's Attorney-General Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez said it was believed the men were shot in the head while resisting a robbery.\n\nMs Andrade Ramirez said a murder investigation was underway after the bodies were discovered in the well on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean almost a week later.\n\nThree suspects have been charged with offences akin to kidnapping.\n\n\"The attackers drove by in their vehicle,\" Ms Andrade Ramirez said.\n\n\"They approached, with the intention of stealing their vehicle and taking the tyres and other parts to put them on the older-model pickup they were driving.\n\n\"When they (the victims) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\n\n\"And these people, the assailants, took out a gun and first they killed the one who was putting up resistance against the vehicle theft, and then others came along and joined the fight to defend their property and their companion who had been attacked, and they killed them too.\"\n\nOn Saturday, authorities identified the three suspects as Jes\u00fas Gerardo Garica Cota (alias El Kekas), his partner Ari Gisel Garc\u00eda Cota, and his brother Cristian Alejandro Garc\u00eda, according to local Spanish language media outlet Zeta Tijuana and Talk Baja.\n\nThey have all been

The missing individuals have been identified as Jack Carter Road from San Diego, and two Australian brothers, Jack and Callum Robinson.\n\nTheir disappearance triggered an extensive search and rescue operation led by local authorities.\n\nThe search took a grim turn on Thursday when Mexican authorities discovered three bodies. While DNA results are pending, there is a high probability that these bodies are those of the missing surfers.\n\nDuring the investigation, it was revealed that the pickup truck belonging to the American surfer was found along the coast and appeared to have been set on fire. Subsequent investigations led to the arrest of two men and a woman on suspicions of kidnapping.\n\nThe lead prosecutor told The New York Times that the suspects had attempted to steal the vehicle from the victims, leading to a fatal confrontation where one of the suspects allegedly opened fire.\n\nFurther deepening the mystery, a fourth body was found in the same location as the three surfers. This individual was identified as a local rancher who had been reported missing several weeks prior.\n\nThe community, especially those from the surfers' home regions, has been left in shock, with many expressing a loss of security and a resolve to avoid the area in the future.\n\nThe case is currently being handled with cooperation between local authorities in Mexico, the FBI, the U.S. State Department, and other agencies.

A truck, said to belong to either Jake or Callum, was also found burnt out at a nearby farm (pictured)\n\nThe corpses were decomposing after the thieves dumped them into a remote, 50- foot deep well\n\nMr Talmi said that areas like Baja California are of special concern for tourists as they are very isolated with low government presence.\n\n'Tourists should exercise extra safety measures to mitigate the risk,' he said.\n\nHis advice for Australian tourists to make their trip to Mexico more safe is to always understand local culture and behaviour.\n\n'Many tourists from many parts of the world believe they can behave the same as they do in their home country without understanding the culture,' he said.\n\nMr Talmi suggests tourists to Mexico should call for assistance or report anything that made them feel unsafe and request security support.\n\nEven with the tragic incident of the two Australian brothers, he said Australians should still travel to Mexico, but to 'always check with a reliable source about the places they are planning to visit and not become a victim.'\n\nEitan Talmi quotes:\n\n- Mexico, as most of the Latin American countries, are a challenge regarding to security. Most of the places, you would be able to visit, live or even work without feeling any threat or risk. Dealing or doing any kind of business with unknown people, or staying on remote areas can lead anyone to front risks or problems that they would like to avoid.\n\n- The violence in Mexico is mostly regarding Cartels and criminal groups activities, Their war for the control of the plazas, may affect the regular life of the Mexican people and also of tourist.\n\nAre there areas tourists should avoid?\n\n- Mexico Is a beautiful country, but as most of LATAM cities, tourist should avoid isolate areas, moving on night hours and dealing with unknown people.\n\nAre the major sites and tourist destinations ok for tourists?\n\n- Yes, people just need to avoid specific areas, or be related to unknown persons or do any kind of business with unknowns.\n\nWhat can Australian tourists do to make their trip to Mexico more safe?\n\n- Always check with a reliable source about the places they are planning to visit. - When possible, receive support and assistance in the planning and during the trip.\n\n- They need to ensure that they understand the local culture and behavior. Many tourist from many parts of the world believe they can behave as same they will do it in their home country without understanding the culture, or who the person in front of them will receive the message of what the person is doing.\n\n- Call for any assistance or report any case they feel unsafe and request security support.\n\n(do you believe tourists are safer in the major tourist areas?)\n\n- If they follow the recommendations and avoid problematic places or situations - YES.\n\n(Should Australian tourists still travel to Mexico?)\n\n- Yes. Just need to understand the situation and not become a victim.\n\n(Is it mainly the isolated areas that are the problem?)\n\nYes. Isolated areas with low government presence are a issue.\n\n(Is the Baja California area of special concern? Why is that?)\n\n- In Baja are many isolates areas that tourist should exercise extra safety measures to mitigate the risk.\n\nREAD MORE: Police reveal the bizarre reason why American man and two

Their last images on social media showed them sitting and gazing at the waves, contemplating the breaks.\n\nWhat happened to end their lives may have been as random as a passing pickup truck full of people with ill intent. The surfers were shot in the head, their bodies dumped in a covered well miles away. How it unfolded was the stuff of nightmares.\n\nBrothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad had apparently stopped to surf the breaks at Punta San Jos\u00e9, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Ensenada. They were attacked there on April 28 or 29.\n\nAs soon as police arrived at their last known camp site, it was clear that something had gone violently wrong.\n\nThere were bloodstains and marks \"as if heavy objects had been dragged,\" leading to suspicions of an attack, the Baja California state prosecutor's office said in an attempt to reconstruct the scene.\n\nChief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez told a press conference on Sunday that the killers apparently drove by, saw the foreigners' pickup truck and wanted to steal its tires and other parts.\n\nSuch was the banality of evil, she said, that \"they were not attacked because they were tourists. ... The evidence suggests they (the killers) did not know where they were from.\"\n\nThe foreigners surely resisted, she said. \"And these people, the assailants, took out a gun, and first they killed the one who was putting up resistance against the vehicle theft, and then the other two came along and joined the fight to defend their property and their companion who had been attacked, and they killed them too.\"\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez said the reconstruction of events was based on the forensic examiner's reports, noting all three had bullet wounds to the head.\n\nThere was a hurried attempt to destroy evidence. The foreigners' tents were apparently burned. The pickup truck was driven miles away and burned. The assailants' truck was later found with a gun inside.\n\nThen, at \"a site that is extremely hard to get to,\" the bodies were dumped into a well about 4 miles (6 kilometers) away. Investigators were surprised when, underneath the bodies of the three foreigners, a fourth body was found that had been there much longer.\n\n\"They had to have previous knowledge of it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said of the attackers, acknowledging the possibility they were behind the previous killing.\n\nThe well had been covered with boards. \"It was literally almost impossible to find it,\" Andrade Ram\u00edrez said. It took two hours to winch the bodies out.\n\nProsecutors have said they were questioning three people in the killings. Two were caught with methamphetamines. One of them, a woman, had one of the victims' cellphones when she was caught. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.\n\nA third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.\n\nThe third man was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, alias \"el Kekas,\" a slang word that means quesadillas, or cheese tortillas.\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez said he had a criminal record that included drug dealing, vehicle theft and domestic violence, adding, \"We are certain that more people were involved.\"\n\nShe emphasized that she could not discuss anything related to the suspects, or their possible statements, because that was not allowed under Mexican law and might prejudice the case against them.\n\nAndrade Ram\u00edrez noted that the victims' families said the brothers and Rhoad had come many times to the seaside spot and never had any problem. This time, however, \"there was no way to ask for help when the attackers showed up.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

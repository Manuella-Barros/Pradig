{"id": 225037588, "title": "Why Reality TV Is On Life Support", "text": "Veteran unscripted producer Wendy Miller was attending a gathering for women over 40 in unscripted television who are unemployed when she had the idea. Though the get-together could easily have turned maudlin, one woman brought levity to the proceedings by telling a story about working on a past show that cracked up the whole room. Miller envisioned a storytelling event, akin to The Moth, where reality TV workers could share outrageous career tales to a paying audience, thus raising money for needy peers: \u201cAll of us are unemployed and have no money, but there are people who are way worse. What if we use this as an opportunity to raise money for someone who\u2019s really in dire straits?\u201d Miller pitched the group. The ensuing \u201cHollywood Horror Happy Hour\u201d (tagline: \u201cWe\u2019re All Broke. Let\u2019s Laugh About It!\u201d), which took place May\u202f21, was just one sign of the times in the nonfiction TV business. Jobs are scarce, budgets are crunched, workers are considering jumping ship and executives seem terrified to take creative risks on untested concepts. This has come as a surprise to some insiders in the space. There was an initial expectation that the 2023 actors and writers strikes would accelerate activity in reality TV, which boomed during the 2007-08 writers strike, but many say the opposite occurred \u2014 even though nonfiction, being relatively cheap to produce and largely nonunion, is a natural stopgap for entertainment companies during work shutdowns. For the waiting workforce, development and production haven\u2019t picked up much since then. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in this industry for 20 years, and all of a sudden the faucet just turned off,\u201d says producer Patrick Caligiuri (Naked and Afraid, American Idol), who has posted multiple times to his TikTok since March about the struggles of entertainment workers. (His first post, emblazoned \u201cReality TV is dead,\u201d took off on LinkedIn, racking up over 2,000 likes and nearly 300 comments.) \u201cIt\u2019s not just people who just moved to L.A. to get into the business that can\u2019t find jobs,\u201d adds one veteran reality TV producer. \u201cIt\u2019s somebody who\u2019s been working for 25 years and has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that I would kill for who\u2019s saying they haven\u2019t worked in a year.\u201d Many veteran unscripted producers and sellers, who asked to remain anonymous in a bid to protect future sales, say the downturn is mirroring what\u2019s happening in the scripted TV space as budgets there, too, are being squeezed across the board, and especially on broadcast. Unscripted shows, which historically have been cheaper to make and faster to produce, are feeling the same fiscal pinch as their scripted counterparts as media companies right-size their slates and spending. \u201cIt\u2019s the same problem as scripted, and it\u2019s really depressing,\u201d says one veteran reality executive. The overalll contraction and M&A have also meant fewer buyers for unscripted fare. Max, for example, no longer has its own unscripted department after incorporating Discovery\u2019s vast portfolio of programming into the streamer. \u201cAt the legacy companies, you have massive fiscal pressure going on \u2014 just look at the stock prices. Those are the traditional buyers. It\u2019s the same reasons you\u2019ve seen in scripted, just leading to unscripted as well,\u201d says one longtime seller. Budgets for the shows that are being greenlit, meanwhile, are getting slashed, which is trickling down to affect the salaries that are being offered, according to sources. Some particularly noteworthy examples have made the rounds in online reality communities: One longtime reality producer, who says seasoned story producers used to be able to make $2,800 a week, shares a job posting starting May\u202f31 and offering $350 to $450 a day, which amounts to $1,750 to $2,250 a week; a story producer sends a screenshot of a job starting in January that offered $1,800 to $2,200 a week for the same role. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s a lot more supply than demand right now\u201d when it comes to available workers, adds the veteran reality TV producer. As a result, \u201cEverybody\u2019s Scrooge McDucking it.\u201d More than ever, unscripted insiders say, buyers are risk-averse and relying on bets that are considered to be safe. What is working right now? \u201cThe big franchises are still being greenlit, and that\u2019s both the big IP \u2014 Deal or No Deal, MasterChef, Lego Masters \u2014 and franchises like Below Deck and the Housewives,\u201d says Banijay Americas CEO Ben Samek, who oversees nine production companies across the United States and Brazil. \u201cNew stuff has to be thoughtful and have a reason why it\u2019s going to get bought.\u201d Fresh sports-related ideas have been especially welcomed in the wake of the popularity of Netflix\u2019s Formula 1: Drive to Survive series, which has been credited with raising viewership of races in the U.S. Insiders note that LeBron James and Maverick Carter\u2019s production shingle, the SpringHill Company, has been a standout seller during this time, with three upcoming sports documentaries for the History Channel and an upcoming docuseries for Vice TV announced just in the past few months. Game shows, too, are prospering amid the overall nonfiction slowdown. Titles like Fox\u2019s The Floor and The Quiz With Balls, both shows that debuted in 2024, can be done on a budget and earn impressive ratings numbers, explains one 20-year unscripted veteran. \u201cAnd they repeat, too,\u201d this person says. \u201cPeople forget questions and rewatch. [They\u2019re] easy to put on and watch.\u201d For those unscripted workers who aren\u2019t attached to long-running franchises and aren\u2019t working on these genres that are breaking through, however, 2024 has been brutal. One longtime editor in the space says she sold a second home out of state and is in the process of selling her L.A. home with the intention of renting until she decides whether she will stay in the city or try to buy a new home. The longtime reality producer shares that her mother took money out of her emergency fund to help pay her bills. The producer has applied for a job at Trader Joe\u2019s. Caligiuri, who began his career in news, dusted off his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and started freelance writing for a local news affiliate. For freelance workers, this period has led to concerns about what the workforce will look like in the next few years. Some who spoke for this story don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to stay in the business. \u201cI\u2019m writing all day. I\u2019m writing scripts, I\u2019m writing half-hour pilots, I\u2019m writing features, I\u2019m creating reality shows,\u201d says Miller, \u201cbut at the same time, I can\u2019t help but think that for the most part, it\u2019s over for me.\u201d Others just wonder who will be left in the reality business in the next year or two. \u201cOur industry has just been kind of flatlined. It\u2019s on life support,\u201d says Caligiuri. In the meantime, some production companies are getting creative, diversifying their revenue streams to weather slumps in the nonfiction market. Critical Content, behind MTV\u2019s Catfish and Netflix\u2019s Sly, for instance, has focused on branded partnerships and first-look deals in international territories to try ideas first overseas and then bring them back stateside. It\u2019s also developing a FAST channel for the truTV hit Storage Hunters, which the company owns. The thought is, \u201cHow do we continue to feed that [unscripted sales] pipeline but also build other pipelines?\u201d says president Jenny Daly. Glass Entertainment Group, behind HGTV\u2019s Christina on the Coast and Tough Love With Hilary Farr, meanwhile, expanded into podcasting about two years ago and sometimes develops that IP as unscripted shows. Results of this effort have included Hulu\u2019s Betrayal: The Perfect Husband. \u201cWe were like, \u2018You know what? If we believe in a story and there isn\u2019t a TV home for it, let\u2019s make a podcast.\u2019 Well, our podcasts have done really well and therefore have become TV shows,\u201d CEO and executive producer Nancy Glass explains. Others are just pushing through the contraction, trying to unearth ideas that will break through. Says one veteran executive, \u201cWhat are we supposed to do? We\u2019re sellers. We have to keep persevering. Talking about it doesn\u2019t help. You have to try or nothing will get through.\u201d This story first appeared in the May 22 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

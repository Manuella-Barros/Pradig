Following reports that Law & Order: Organized Crime would be moving to Peacock to become a streaming series, the news has been made official.\n\nPer NBCUniversal, it's been officially announced that Law & Order: Organized Crime has been renewed for Season 5. Along with the renewal comes the confirmation that the series is hopping over to Peacock moving forward. John Shiban will return as showrunner for Season 5 despite the switch. Of course, Christopher Meloni will also continue to star in his franchise role as Det. Elliot Stabler.\n\nRelated 10 Best Law & Order: SVU Character Exits, Ranked Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has featured some impressive actors and actresses that, even after their exit, left an unforgettable mark.\n\nLaw & Order: Organized Crime is created by Dick Wolf, Matt Olmstead, and Ilene Chaiken. Wolf and Shiban executive produce with Meloni, Paul Cabbad, Jon Cassar, Arthur Forney, and Peter Jankowski. The show is produced by Universal Television in association with Wolf Entertainment.\n\nOrganized Crime Will Leave Behind Fellow NBC Shows\n\nThe main Law & Order series will be continuing on NBC. After an original run for 20 seasons between 1990 and 2010, the series returned for Season 21 in 2022. In March, the show was renewed for Season 24. It's joined by Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which continues to be a major success since its debut in 1999. It was also renewed in March, which will put the series into its 26th season. Meanwhile, a Canadian spinoff, Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent, debuted to high viewership on Canada's Citytv in February.\n\nRelated What Happened to Sam in Law & Order: Organized Crime? Samir Hashir's introduction in Law & Order: Organized Crime kicked off a string of intense events for the series, but what was his ultimate fate?\n\nThere's a precedent for Law & Order shows moving to find continued success, though Organized Crime will be the first time a series has switched from broadcast television to streaming. Law & Order: Criminal Intent originally ran on NBC for six seasons before moving to USA Network, where it continued for another four seasons. In the case of Organized Crime, the series features more serialized storytelling compared to Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, and this could be why the show is performing below the other Wolf-produced dramas on NBC. Notably, however, Organized Crime has been performing well on Peacock, so the move does make sense from a business standpoint.\n\nClose\n\nStream Law & Order: Organized Crime on Peacock. The Season 4 finale will be airing on NBC on Thursday, May 16, and will become available for streaming the next day on Peacock.\n\nSource: NBCUniversal\n\nLaw & Order: Organized Crime TV-14

It brought Meloni back to the world of Law & Order in 2021, via a two-part crossover with SVU that led into the premiere of Organized Crime.\n\nThis news comes ahead of the Season 4 finale on Thursday, May 16 -- it will be the last episode to air on NBC. (Episodes have been available the next day on Peacock this season.) And it's a good thing considering what Tate Ellington told TV Insider about how the finale sets up another season.\n\nRelatedWhy 'Law & Order: Organized Crime' Needs to Be Renewed\n\n\"It sets up one in many ways, but I don't want to give too much away because I want to make sure that everybody's excited when it happens,\" he shared. \"It's a power-packed episode. It is very action-packed. It leads to some excitement. So definitely gear up and be ready for it because it's a nice build. This episode coming up builds into the next, which builds into the finale, so it's a rollercoaster for the next three, which is great.\"\n\nMore from this section Runes of Magic Official Shadows over the Altar Update Launch Trailer SaGa Emerald Beyond Official Combat Basics Trailer Joey Sasso Makes It Clear He Wasn't Flirting With Tayshia Adams on 'The Goat,' Reveals He Is in a Committed Relationship\n\nJohn Shiban will be returning as the showrunner in Season 5.

Old seasons are also available to stream.\n\nThe streaming service offers two plans viewers can subscribe to: Premium and Premium Plus. The former is $5.99/month and contains ads, while the latter is $11.99/month and has no ads (with limited exclusions) and also allows users the option to download episodes to watch offline.\n\nIn April, Comcast's NBCUniversal shared it will raise Peacock subscription prices by $2, bringing Premium to $7.99/month and Premium Plus to $13.99/month. The increases will go into effect in July, ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, for new customers and in mid-August for existing customers.\n\nMeloni's Elliot Stabler, who spent over a decade partnered with Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson on \"SVU,\" reprised Stabler for \"OC\" and has been with the show since Season One. His current superior, Sgt. Ayanna Bell (Danielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt), has also been on the show since its first season, as has Detective Jet Slootmaekers (Ainsley Seiger).\n\nThe squad's other detective, Bobby Reyes (Rick Gonzalez), joined the cast in Season Three.\n\nTate Ellington was brought into the fold in Season Four as Dr. Kyle Vargas, a tech expert who uses AI to assist the team in solving crimes.\n\nSeason Four also introduced two new members of the Stabler family -- his brothers, Randall (Dean Norris) and Joe Jr. (Michael Trotter). Other family members who have appeared over the season include matriarch Bernadette \"Bernie\" Stabler (Ellen Burstyn) and Elliot Stabler's children: Maureen (Autumn Mirassou), Dickie (Jeffrey Scaperrotta), Lizzie (Kaitlyn Davidson), Kathleen (Allison Siko) and Eli (Nicky Torchia).\n\nBefore the news became official May 9, fans had been posting for weeks on social media platforms like X to #RenewOrganizedCrime. They even united to commission a billboard to run in Times Square as part of an effort to support the show's continuation.\n\nBoth Meloni and Truitt acknowledged the efforts.\n\nIn response to one of the posts about the billboard, Truitt wrote on X: \"Wait... what?? This is real? Wow... you guys... Ya'll really are the best... #RenewOrganizedCrime.\"\n\nShe also teased a Season Five in an April 30 Instagram post celebrating the end of filming Season Four.\n\n\"Another one in the books! THAT'S A WRAP on Season 4 of Law And Order Organized Crime!! I am truly blessed to work with such talented, kind, fun, quality human beings!!

Christopher Meloni's Net Worth In 2024", "body": "Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler in \"Law & Order: Organized Crime\"\n\nChristopher Meloni's net worth in 2024 is more than enough to keep him comfortable for life if he retired today -- but fortunately for the rest of us, he's happy to keep working.\n\n\"I mean, I'm an employed actor. I'm in my 60s, and I've been working and working and working for 25 years,\" he previously told Parade. (It's actually 35 years, but he joked he can't do math!)\n\nHis return to the role of Elliot Stabler in 2021 on Law & Order: Organized Crime after leaving Law & Order: SVU a decade earlier was a breath of fresh air for Meloni, both professionally and creatively.\n\n\"I'd never returned to work where everyone was so glad to be back,\" he told Parade of getting back to work on the show's fourth season. \"Everyone's grateful and everyone comes with a good attitude, but this time it was, 'Thank God, thank God.' It takes a little pain for you to understand and appreciate what you have.\"\n\nWhat he has includes a ton of cash from playing the temperamental cop for nearly two decades. We'd be appreciative too!\n\nRelated: Christopher Meloni Reveals How He Really Feels About #Bensler\n\nHow did Christopher Meloni become famous?\n\nBorn in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 1961, Meloni was raised in Alexandria, Virginia. He was a bit of a jock at his private parochial high school, serving as the quarterback of his football team.\n\nThough he majored and got his bachelor's degree in history, Meloni caught the acting bug in college when he took theatre electives at the University of Colorado-Boulder. After graduating \"without a plan,\" Meloni moved to New York City in 1984 at the suggestion of a pal. There, he studied with the legendary acting coach Sanford Meisner and worked as a bartender and personal trainer and in construction while trying to break into TV and film.\n\nMeloni's first roles included a starring role in the 1990 sitcom The Fanelli Boys; Spike, a pal of Robbie Sinclair, in the beloved sitcom Dinosaurs in 1991; Doug Kirkfield in The Boys (not to be confused with the Prime Video series).\n\nHe cut his teeth as an onscreen cop as Jimmy Liery, a recurring role in NYPD Blue and got a taste of the other side as incarcerated murderer Chris Keller in Oz and when he guest-starred as a bounty hunter in two episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street.\n\nRelated: Get to Know Christopher Meloni's Wife Sherman Williams\n\nObviously, his biggest break came in 1999 when he first starred as Elliot Stabler in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, though Meloni revealed to Parade that he wasn't necessarily worried about getting the part at all.\n\n\"When I got the call, I had just landed in Hawaii. I had been waiting for over a month, and I had auditioned once for [creator] Dick Wolf and the second time for Dick Wolf and the showrunner,\" he said. \"Then radio silence. Sure enough, I was tired of waiting around. So my wife and I went to Hawaii, and I got a call to come to New York for a screen test. What I remember is that I was unnaturally confident and comfortable.\"\n\nHe added, \"I had a job with Oz. So I'm like, 'I don't need this job.' But I hadn't signed a contract with Oz, so it freed me up. That was a rare feeling. I'm usually not a great auditioner so I just went in with that confidence.\"\n\nMeloni played Stabler until 2011 and returned to a decade later in Law & Order: Organized Crime.\n\nWhile known best as the hotheaded cop in the procedural drama, he also has some serious comedy bona fides, starring in Wet Hot American Summer in 2001 (and its sequel series) and as multiple characters in the sketch show Mad TV and sitcom Happy!!, as well as multiple cameos in animated comedies including American Dad, Family Guy and as Jesus Christ in Rick and Morty.\n\nAnd let's be real: Meloni's acting talent made him famous, but part of why he's stayed famous, is, well, them cakes.\n\nRelated: Mariska Hargitay's Net Worth From SVU and More\n\nWhat is Christopher Meloni's net worth in 2024?\n\nChristopher Meloni's net worth in 2024 is a cool $30 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nRelated: Ice-T's Net Worth From SVU and More\n\nHow much does Christopher Meloni make per episode?\n\nAt present, Meloni reportedly makes $500,000 per episode for Law & Order: Organized Crime. His salary on Law & Order: SVU peaked at $395,000 per episode. This doesn't include residuals or re-runs, which have likely made him a mint as well.\n\nRelated: 50 Best Law & Order: SVU Episodes, Ranked\n\nHow much does Christopher Meloni make per episode on Organized Crime?\n\nAccording to Radar Online, Meloni makes about $500,000 per episode of Law & Order: Organized Crime, putting him on par with his former SVU (and frequent crossover) co-star Mariska Hargitay.\n\nRelated: All the Stabler Family Secrets Revealed on Law & Order: Organized Crime\n\nHow much does Christopher Meloni make per episode on SVU?\n\nAt his peak on Law & Order: SVU, Meloni made $395,000 per episode ($10 million per season), according to PEOPLE. When his salary was cut to $300,000 per episode ($8 million per season) in 2011 -- a 24% to 25% cut, depending on which measure you use -- he bounced from the series. This doesn't include residuals or what he makes on re-runs.\n\nRelated: Exactly How Rich Dick Wolf Got From Your Law & Order Obsession\n\nWho is the highest paid actor on Law and Order?\n\nThat would be Hargitay: As a producer and the longest-running star in the franchise since Law & Order: SVU debuted in 1999, she's made serious bank. She reportedly makes $500,000 per episode of the series as of 2022, not including what she makes for residuals and re-runs.\n\nNext, 13 Show to Watch If You Love the Law & Order Franchise", "source":

The Season 4 finale will air on NBC on May 16 and stream the next day on Peacock.\n\nMoving \"Law & Order: OC\" to Peacock is not altogether surprising. The show has lagged behind fellow Dick Wolf series \"Law & Order,\" \"Law & Order: SVU,\" and the three \"Chicago\" shows at NBC while still maintaining solid viewership. It also reportedly does very well on Peacock, particularly given its more serialized storylines, a departure from Wolf's typical procedural format.\n\nIt was also the last Dick Wolf broadcast show awaiting word on its fate for next season. The other two \"Law & Order\" shows and all three \"Chicago\" shows were renewed back in March. Likewise, all three \"FBI\" shows at CBS, which also fall under the Wolf Entertainment umbrella, were renewed in April.\n\nChristopher Meloni stars in \"Law & Order: OC\" as Det. Elliot Stabler, the role he originally played on \"SVU\" before departing the show ahead of its 13th season. The show also stars \u202fDanielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt, Rick Gonzalez, and Ainsley Seiger. In the series, Stabler returns to New York and joins the Organized Crime Control Bureau, taking on dangerous crime syndicates throughout the city.\n\nWolf created the series along with Matt Olmstead and Ilene Chaiken.

After it was reported that the Christopher Meloni-led Law & Order spinoff was likely switching to Peacock from NBC for Season 5, the streamer has confirmed the news. The fifth season is expected to have just 10 episodes. Meanwhile, John Shiban, who joined the series ahead of Season 4 as the new showrunner, will return to helm Organized Crime for Season 5.\n\nNews of the renewal and move to Peacock comes just a week before the Season 4 finale, which will be the final episode on NBC. What this means for future crossovers is unknown, especially since the series has been doing occasional crossovers with Law & Order: SVU, which is returning to NBC for Season 26. Not to mention the fact that Meloni's Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson have been in a will they/won't they relationship for years, so hopefully, that will continue to develop, even if it's just off-screen or occasional mentions.\n\nAs of now, it's unknown if Organized Crime will premiere its fifth season this year on Peacock, as sometime streaming shows can take a little bit more time. The good news is that with the show pivoting to streaming, this will make the episodes longer, giving it an advantage to further storylines without a time limit. Perhaps it could also give Peacock the idea to make more Law & Order shows that don't necessarily have to be on NBC. At the very least, while this move may not be good for those who don't have Peacock, the show is still coming back, which is better than nothing.\n\nLaw & Order: Organized Crime is not the first show to move from network TV to streaming, but it should be interesting to see how it does and what changes. Hopefully, this will mark a new chapter for Organized Crime and cement it as a Peacock Original for years to come. The move shows that NBCUniversal isn't ready to see the show end, so you never know what could happen. More information on the upcoming season should be revealed in the coming months, but for now, fans can watch the final episodes of Organized Crime on Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on NBC. The Season 4 finale will air next Thursday, May 16. All four seasons are streaming on Peacock.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shiban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Shiban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Stabler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Stabler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariska_Hargitay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariska Hargitay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Benson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Benson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Organized_Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Organized Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/04/18/0c3a585a-f1cd-46ce-b08f-0f873fa04587/law-and-order-organized-crime-crossroads-christopher-meloni-nbc.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554414", "eventUri": "eng-9554414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 2153, "textEnd": 2159}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Actor Chris Meloni revealed his thoughts not too long ago about a relationship between the two characters actually happening.\n\nMeloni and Hargitay were aware of their chemistry the moment they met. The two formed a quick bond with each other even before doing their screentest. One of their first memories together was Meloni making Hargitay laugh by telling her a story. Their bond was only solidified after auditioning together, which would create a friendship that would last for decades.\n\n\"I walked in, saw him, and I went, 'That guy. That's the guy.' It went deep, very fast. We both knew that it was something big,\" Hargitay told People not too long ago. \"I won't say that I fully understood it, but I knew that meeting him was important and life-changing. My father, my husband, [Law & Order creator] Dick Wolf, and Chris are the four pillar men in my life. And that happened early.\"\n\nThe two started off as partners on the show. But as the series progressed, many fans started shipping Meloni's Stabler and Hargitay's Benson as a couple. Meloni believed this was inspired by his interactions with his co-star in the real world.\n\n\"Well, that's our currency,\" Meloni said in an interview with Parade. \"I'll give the credit to our original SVU showrunner, who set that stage and recognized [the chemistry] as something the audience saw. But I think what they were really seeing was Mariska and my genuine affection for each other, and they ran with it. The fans had a big role in insisting the writers play up that angle just a little bit.\"\n\nAlthough many fans may hope to see a true Stabler and Benson romance arc, Meloni isn't thrilled about the idea. Still, he'd be willing to make it work if it did happen.\n\n\"Well, look, I don't think so,\" Meloni said about wanting a possible hook-up with Benson. \"But, to be honest, if they would write it that way, I'd go with it.\"\n\nMeloni conceded that his surprising departure from SVU left the Stabler and Benson dynamic unresolved for a long time. Years later, Meloni would return to the Law & Order universe in the spinoff Organized Crime. It was only a matter of time before he and Hargitay would cross paths on the show again. When they did, the two nearly kissed in what was an intimate and vulnerable moment for them both.\n\nIt turned out, however, that Benson and Stabler were initially supposed to fully kiss during the scene. But it was nixed by the showrunners, which Hargitay and Meloni disagreed with.\n\n\"To be honest with you, Chris and I thought it should go one way, and the powers that be didn't, so it got changed at the last minute, that near kiss,\" Hargitay told Variety. \"Obviously, Dick gets final say. It's his show, and he didn't want that.\"\n\nStill, the moment teased that an actual Benson and Stabler romance might be inching closer toward becoming a thing. With SVU showing no signs of slowing down, there are plenty of years left to explore this overarching subplot.\n\n\"Benson and Stabler love each other deeply. It's so deep,\" Hargitay said in an interview with Today. \"The show is probably only going to go another 23 years, so I think we should just wait and see.\"\n\nThe scene between Hargitay and Meloni wasn't actually all that difficult for the pair. Their close bond allowed a smooth transition from partners and friends to potential love interests.\n\n\"I think both of us, it was such a long time coming; we just want to make sure and get it right,\" Hargitay said. \"The good news is we are so comfortable around each other; it was effortless and fun, and we trust each other; it was beautiful that way. We just focused on the work.\"", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antonio_stallings@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Antonio Stallings", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benson (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Stabler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Stabler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Benson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Benson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dick Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parade (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chris-Meloni-Mariska-Hargitay.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554414", "eventUri": "eng-9554414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

John Shiban is returning as showrunner.\n\nThe move gives the NBCUniversal streamer an original Dick Wolf drama series to go with the Wolf library and next-day runs of the company's remaining NBC series Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, which are among the platform's most viewed titles.\n\nCreated by Dick Wolf, Matt Olmstead and Ilene Chaiken, Law & Order: Organized Crime follows the detectives of the Organized Crime Control Bureau, led by SVU's Elliot Stabler (Meloni), as they take on New York City's most vicious and violent criminal syndicates.\n\nLikely because of its subject matter and serialized storytelling, the series has performed below the five other Wolf dramas in linear ratings on NBC while doing well on Peacock.\n\nThis is the second series in the Law & Order franchise to transition to another platform after starting on NBC. L&O: Criminal Intent ran on USA Network for four additional seasons after the initial six on NBC.\n\nOrganized Crime -- whose first four seasons consisted of 8 episodes after a spring launch (S1), 22 (S2-3) and 13 for the strike-impacted S4 -- is executive produced by Wolf, Shiban, Paul Cabbad, Meloni, Jon Cassar, Arthur W.

TV Line is reporting that Organized Crime has finally been renewed, and as expected, will be moved from NBC to Peacock. While the series will be moving to a new home, one element that won't be changing is the showrunner, as John Shiban will be returning to helm season 5. If you've been keeping up with Organized Crime's showrunner revolving door, the fact that a showrunner will be at the helm for multiple seasons is a major deal, as it hasn't happened yet in the show's four-year history.\n\nOrganized Crime has done well on Peacock in the day after it airs on NBC, but now it will be the exclusive place to keep up with the show. Peacock will still be the place to watch the franchise, as the flagship show and SVU both appear there the day after their original airings on NBC. Organized Crime averages more than 5.4 million total viewers with Live+7. Playback in the mix), and 851,000 of those viewers are in the 18 to 49 age demographic.\n\nOrganized Crime will be the second series in the franchise to switch networks midway through its run. Criminal Intent did the same thing, originally running on NBC for six seasons before airing four more seasons on USA Network. Hopefully, Organized Crime is on track for a similar run after season 5.\n\nOrganized Crime completes the franchise's renewals at NBCUniversal. This will be season 24 of Law & Order, while SVU will return for its 26th season. For the Chicago family of shows, it will be Chicago Fire's 13th season, Chicago Med's 10th season, and Chicago PD's 12th season.\n\nDuring the previous renewals, President of scripted programming at NBCUniversal and Streaming Lisa Katz celebrated SVU's 25th season. \"We understand the emotional connection our audience has with these characters and we can't wait to bring more of their stories to the forefront next season.

Organized Crime has allowed Meloni to reunite with stars like Hargitay through crossover episodes. But fans of the show have seen Meloni's Elliot Stabler getting close to other co-workers as well. One of them would be Ainsley Seiger's Jet Slootmaekers.\n\nSeiger plays a former hacker who's recruited by Elliot to work for law enforcement. It's a pairing between veteran and young newcomer that have intrigued many fans of the show, including Meloni himself.\n\n\"I'm obsessed with my relationship with Ainsley. But the best part is her originality, who she is, how she wears it, how she carries herself. How professional she is, how good she is,\" Meloni once told NBC.\n\nLikewise, Seiger has also had a good time working with Meloni.\n\n\"The idea of getting to work with Chris Meloni was really exciting to me, and that has lived up to its expectations. It's been amazing and so fun. I love the show. I love everyone that I worked with. It's been great,\" she said.\n\nOrganized Crime is a breakout role for Seiger, and one she acquired through auditioning. She impressed casting directors with her performance, and was almost immediately a part of Law & Order mythology afterwards.\n\n\"I sent in two tapes of me doing scenes from the show. One of them was the scene in the pilot episode that I have with Stabler. I sent them in, and I didn't hear back for about a week and a half. I was like, 'I didn't get it.' Then, I got a call a few hours later, 'You're moving to New York in three days.' It's been very fast. It's been a total rollercoaster,\" she once told Pop Culturalist.\n\nSeiger noted that she was already a fan of Dick Wolf's franchise before being cast. But this just added to the pressure of living up to the expectations of the cast, crew, and even fans.\n\n\"I really wanted Jet to be unique and original,\" Seiger said. \"The writers have done an incredible job making Jet her own person and her own character outside of the stereotypical tech person that we all know exists. They've done an amazing job, and I get so excited to play her every day, but yeah, I was definitely nervous. I wanted to make a good impression, not only for the fans and network, but also for my castmates.\"\n\nGiven Meloni's decades' worth of experience, Seiger soaked up as much as she could from her co-star while on set. She asserted she learns from Meloni through his advice, and through his example.\n\n\"Chris is always dropping little nuggets of wisdom all over the place,\" she said. \"This is probably where a bit of Jet comes out in me, but I learn more by watching him work and observing him doing a scene or the way that he conducts himself in the space; I learned by picking up on the things that he's doing. He's had such an amazing career, and it shows. I mean, just the way he walks into a room and his presence. He's such a giving scene partner, too, which is really fulfilling. The biggest thing I've learned from him is to take up space.\"", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antonio_stallings@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Antonio Stallings", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Stabler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Stabler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainsley_Seiger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ainsley Seiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dick Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chris-meloni-ainsley-seiger.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554414", "eventUri": "eng-9554414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Are you excited for what lies ahead ... or nervous?\n\nWell, the first thing that we should say here is that \"Stabler's Lament\" is the title for the installment, and the #1 question we have a result is simple: Which Stabler are we talking about here? Are there reasons for multiple people in the family to be in grave danger? Well, the simple answer to that seems to be yes, all things considered. There is going to be chaos, heated discussions, and hopefully a little bit of closure. A lot of what we've seen this whole season is about family, and that has been refreshing. After all, for all the years we've watched Christopher Meloni's character, there was never this big of an opportunity to dive into his history and some of the other people within his life. There has been something really valuable about this journey.\n\nNow, let's get more into the story. Below, the Law & Order: Organized Crime season 4 episode 13 synopsis gives you a better sense of what lies ahead here:\n\n05/16/2024 (10:00PM - 11:00PM) (Thursday) : When the ATF Bureau plans a raid of Redcoat's warehouse, Trisha promises to help Stabler keep Joe Jr. safe. Bell comes face to face with the man who killed Sam. Another Stabler family dinner causes tensions to run high.

For starters, John Shiban is going to be back as the showrunner, and that is just notable given the fact that there have been so many changes at this position from the beginning of the show. Meanwhile, the new season is going to last for ten episodes -- that may not look like a lot, but it's actually a pretty solid order by Peacock standards for a scripted drama show.\n\nSo why move the series away from NBC in the first place? Well, it is largely the function of a few different things. For starters, Organized Crime fared worse in the live + same-day figures than any other Dick Wolf series, and we do think that the serialized format actually works better on streaming. This could also allow the show to get a little bit darker -- if they choose to move things in that direction, at least. (There are still things to learn in regards to that at the moment.)\n\nOf course, it may be some time before we learn when the series will premiere, or what this means for crossovers between it and some other versions of the franchise. In general, we're choosing to just be grateful that we are going to see more of the series, mostly because we know how hard it can be for a lot of shows to come back in this hyper-competitive era. Let's just hope that along the way, season 4 has a fantastic ending, as well.\n\nRelated - Get more news entering the next new Law & Order: Organized Crime episode\n\nShare right now in the attached comments!

I'm in my 60s, and I've been working and working and working for 25 years,\" he previously toldParade. (It's actually 35 years, but he joked he can't do math!)\n\nHis return to the role of Elliot Stabler in 2021 on Law & Order: Organized Crimeafter leavingLaw & Order: SVUa decade earlier was a breath of fresh air for Meloni, both professionally and creatively.\n\n\"I'd never returned to work where everyone was so glad to be back,\" he told Parade of getting back to work on the show's fourth season. \"Everyone's grateful and everyone comes with a good attitude, but this time it was, 'Thank God, thank God.' It takes a little pain for you to understand and appreciate what you have.\"\n\nWhat he has includes a ton of cash from playing the temperamental cop for nearly two decades. We'd be appreciative too!\n\nBorn in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 1961, Meloni was raised in Alexandria, Virginia. He was a bit of a jock at his private parochial high school, serving as the quarterback of his football team.\n\nThough he majored and got his bachelor's degree in history, Meloni caught the acting bug in college when he took theatre electives at the University of Colorado-Boulder. After graduating \"without a plan,\" Meloni moved to New York City in 1984 at the suggestion of a pal. There, he studied with the legendary acting coach Sanford Meisner and worked as a bartender and personal trainer and in construction while trying to break into TV and film.\n\nMeloni's first roles included a starring role in the 1990 sitcom The Fanelli Boys; Spike, a pal of Robbie Sinclair, in the beloved sitcom Dinosaurs in 1991; Doug Kirkfield in The Boys (not to be confused with the Prime Video series).\n\nHe added, \"I had a job with Oz. So I'm like, 'I don't need this job.' But I hadn't signed a contract with Oz, so it freed me up. That was a rare feeling. I'm usually not a great auditioner so I just went in with that confidence.\"\n\nMeloni played Stabler until 2011 and returned to a decade later in Law & Order: Organized Crime.\n\nHow much does Christopher Meloni make per episode?\n\nHow much does Christopher Meloni make per episode on SVU?\n\nThat would be Hargitay: As a producer and the longest-running star in the franchise since Law & Order: SVU debuted in 1999, she's made serious bank. She reportedly makes $500,000 per episode of the series as of 2022, not including what she makes for residuals and re-runs.\n\nNext, 13 Show to Watch If You Love theLaw & OrderFranchise", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_sager@miamiherald.com", "name": "Jessica Sager", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Stabler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Stabler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parade (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fanelli_Boys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Fanelli Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Organized_Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Organized Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Meisner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanford Meisner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinclair Broadcast Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oz (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinosaurs (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bartender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/rzwzgi/picture288436961/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/45d815c5-805d-4238-8350-21fe7691c754", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554414", "eventUri": "eng-9554414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Fans were misled and disappointed when an intimate Elliot and Olivia moment was cut in a recent season. The constant will-they-won't-they aspect of Elliot and Olivia's potential romance has grown tiresome for viewers and the show needs to either commit to it or drop it.\n\nIn the 25 years Law and Order: SVU has been on the air, it has garnered a massive fanbase, and for good reason. The series follows the detectives of the Special Victims Unit in New York City as they investigate sexually-based crimes. Early seasons featured the lead detective pairing of Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), and viewers saw them go through a lot together -- everything from arguments over cases to life-and-death situations while on the job. Throughout it all, they've always had a deep love and respect for one another, which, of course, has led many viewers to ship the pair.\n\nBut Benson and Stabler haven't so much as shared a peck on the cheek, despite the obvious tension between them. Granted, Elliot was married for the majority of his time on the series, but even after the death of his wife Kathy (Isabel Gillies), SVU has yet to make Elliot and Olivia an official couple. This wouldn't necessarily be a cause for complaint if it weren't for the fact that a romance between them is heavily teased across multiple episodes. Even when it seems like they'll finally get their moment, the show pulls the rug out from underneath them, and it's back to square one. Maybe it's time SVU -- and show creator Dick Wolf -- drops the will-they-won't-they aspect between Benson and Stabler for good.\n\nLaw & Order: SVU\n\nThis series follows the Special Victims Unit, a specially trained squad of detectives in the New York City Police Department that investigate sexually related crimes.\n\nGenre Crime Drama Language English Number of Seasons 25 Debut Date September 20, 1999 Studio NBC, Wolf Entertainment Benson and Stabler Have Been Through a Lot on 'SVU'\n\nSVU is notorious for putting its characters through the wringer at times -- specifically Olivia Benson. The woman has been party to so many devastating and traumatizing things that it's honestly a miracle she's still a part of the unit. She's been kidnapped and tortured, nearly assaulted, wounded, lost loved ones, and the list goes on and on. But the one constant good thing in her life was Elliot Stabler. He was always more than just her partner, he was her closest friend. Working together in such an intense unit is bound to bring any two people close together; after all, you have to trust your partner when dealing with such high-intensity cases. Even though Benson and Stabler didn't always see eye to eye, they always managed to work it out and come out just as strong. When Elliot left SVU in Season 11, coinciding with Meloni's departure from the show, it's safe to say that Olivia was gutted. He didn't even tell her that he was leaving -- she found out via Cragen (Dann Floreck) -- and his absence notably changes her as a character.\n\nWhen Stabler finally returned to the series as a recurring character starting in Season 22, fans rejoiced -- but there was still so much left unsaid between the former partners, so much that Benson had gone through without him by her side. After so many years of knowing each other and working together, his departure without even so much as a face-to-face goodbye was a tough pill to swallow. Even in Season 25 of SVU, Stabler doesn't know the full scope of what happened to Liv while he was gone. It wasn't as if a romance was immediately going to blossom between them as soon as he returned, and no one expected it to. A romance between Stabler and Benson was always going to be something that happened gradually. But with how much the show has teased it and then yanked it away, it feels as though it's more of a game, rather than anything SVU is still planning on building towards.\n\nDick Wolf Decided To Cut a Benson and Stabler Kiss From 'SVU'\n\nAwaiting a Benson and Stabler romance wasn't impossible when it still seemed it could happen at any time. But then, in Season 24, a promo was released that showed Elliot and Olivia in a very intimate embrace. With her hands on his face and his forehead pressed to hers, fans began to screech in excitement. Finally, after 24 long seasons, the two characters were going to kiss.\n\nWhen the actual episode premiered, the scene in question was notably different. It wasn't as intimate as it seemed in the promo, and, frankly, it didn't look the same. Just when fans thought the characters were still going to share a kiss, Benson cut Stabler off and told him that, while she wanted to, she couldn't. On the one hand, her choice was understandable, because as previously mentioned, there was still so much they hadn't discussed since his return. But fans still felt misled because of the previously-released promo, which used a completely different version of the scene as bait to bring in viewers.\n\nIt wasn't just fans who were left disappointed, as Mariska Hargitay recently shared her thoughts on the cut scenein an interview with Variety. Speaking of the infamous almost-kiss, Hargitay shared her thoughts on the moment between the characters, referencing the fact that she and Meloni seemed to be at odds with creator Dick Wolf over how the scene should play out:\n\n\"To be honest with you, Chris and I thought it should go one way and the powers that be didn't, so it got changed at the last minute, that near kiss. Obviously Dick gets final say. It's his show and he didn't want that.\"\n\nIt's Time for 'SVU' To Commit to a Benson/Stabler Relationship or Let It Go Close\n\nIt's clear the Benson and Stabler ship isn't sailing any time soon, but at least the audience isn't alone in seeing the potential between the characters, as Hargitay herself remarked to Variety: \"Our chemistry is undeniable. It's just the way it is.\" It makes sense that the show wants to take things slow with Stabler and Benson, because putting them together could very easily break all the tension that has built up over the years. But fans have just grown tired of the constant back and forth. Is there hope for a Benson and Stabler romance in the future, or should viewers forget the possibility altogether?\n\nSVU isn't a show that needs romance to be successful, but after all these years of teasing the potential of romance, it would be nice to get confirmation one way or another. Before, it came down to the simple fact that SVU either had to commit to the Benson and Stabler romance or let it go, but now it may be for the best if the show calls it quits altogether. No more dragging fans along for a ride that isn't going anywhere any time soon, or teasing the idea of it only to take it away at the last minute for the sake of unnecessary drama -- when even the actors themselves seem to want it to happen.\n\nLaw and Order: SVU is available to stream on Peacock in the U.S.\n\nWATCH ON PEACOCK", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benson (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Stabler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Stabler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Benson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Benson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Gillies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isabel Gillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariska_Hargitay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mariska Hargitay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dick Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolf Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promo_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promo (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recurring character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiss (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2313-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554414", "eventUri": "eng-9554414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1999-09-20", "textStart": 2016, "textEnd": 2034}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

That said, Christopher Meloni's drama won't return to NBC, but make the move to Peacock to becoming a streaming original. While it remains to be seen what NBC will do with Organized Crime's Thursday night time slot, the move to Peacock combined with other details of the renewal leave me wondering if OC is on the verge of going full Breaking Bad.\n\nLaw & Order: Organized Crime will debut its fifth season exclusively streaming for fans with Peacock Premium subscriptions, with all four current seasons so far already available on the platform. As expected, Christopher Meloni will be back as Elliot Stabler. The press release from Peacock did not confirm who else will be back for Season 5.\n\nIt did confirm that former Breaking Bad producer/writer/director John Shiban will return for a second season as showrunner, which wouldn't be remarkable for just about any show other than Law & Order: Organized Crime. The SVU spinoff has had more showrunners than seasons, as he was the sixth to take the gig.\n\nAt the time of writing, there's no sign that OC will have to make massive story changes to move from NBC to Peacock, but there are potential perks on streaming that definitely had me thinking about what Shiban and Co. could pull off on the new platform.\n\nIf you ask me, Organized Crime felt different from the jump in Season 4, with Danielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt sharing what changed and what didn't with Shiban's arrival. And I don't just mean the change to the status quo with the reveal of Jet and Reyes' affair, either! The show has been no less dark than previous seasons, but the balance this time around is such that the humor hits better. Breaking Bad alum Dean Norris even described the Stabler family scenes as \"quintessential kind of John Shiban-type thing.\"\n\nThere's no reason to believe that Shiban will take the show in a completely different direction in Season 5, and it's possible that moving to streaming could free the show up to try some things that weren't possible on broadcast network television, even in the 10 p.m. ET time slot. I'm not expecting Elliot Stabler to find his own Heisenberg persona and go full Walter White in Season 5, but it would be fun if somebody on OC could drop the occasional F-bomb like Breaking Bad did back in the day and get more gruesome than what flies on NBC.\n\nI can also imagine the show becoming even more serialized, perhaps with longer arcs, as soon as the traditional rating system doesn't apply anymore. And who knows? Maybe Dean Norris could be the first of many Breaking Bad actors to join. I know I'd love to see Organized Crime keep leaning on dark humor, because what Breaking Bad fan can't quote a some of the funniest parts of the AMC series to go along with the drama? (I'm partial to Jesse Pinkman's \"This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed... BITCH!\" from Season 3 myself.)\n\nAll in all, we'll have to wait and see if Organized Crime has some new freedoms with episodes releasing on Peacock rather than airing on NBC first. There's not really precedent for this at this point, although there are certainly shows on Peacock that include the kinds of language that can't air on broadcast network TV. For now, you can find the remaining episodes of Law & Order: Organized Crime Season 4 in the 2024 TV schedule on Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on NBC.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_hurley@cinemablend.com", "name": "Laura Hurley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Organized_Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law & Order: Organized Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul_(season_5)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Better Call Saul (season 5)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shiban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Shiban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breaking Bad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Stabler", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Stabler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Mon\u00e9_Truitt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walter White (Breaking Bad)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Pinkman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Pinkman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMC (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serial (radio and television)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5NzeB97yuwdbcu5XCnS3k-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554414", "eventUri": "eng-9554414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 452992912, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 27, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 27}}}

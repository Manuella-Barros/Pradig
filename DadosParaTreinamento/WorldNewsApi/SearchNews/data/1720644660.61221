There has been a major response to Dr Mosley's disappearance. The operation was initially focused on the vicinity of the coastal path where he was last seen, but has since been expanded to other parts of the island. Police officers alongside a police dog are searching for him, as well as the coast guard, firefighters and local volunteers. A drone is also being used and Greek police arranged for a helicopter to be flown in from Athens, with a senior source telling the Daily Mail: \"We have also applied to the civil protection ministry in Athens for a helicopter and special dogs to be brought in. \"We are focusing on the area of the path we believe Michael would have taken from the beach in Agios Nikolaos to Pedi but as so much time has elapsed since he went missing we have also expanded our search to other parts of the island.\" What are the authorities saying? Senior police spokesman Constantina Dimoglidou told the Daily Mail: \"Any and every attempt to track him down has not produced any result. We have now asked the fire brigade to assist in the operation in the case that he may have slipped, tripped, fallen, even bitten by a snake, remaining injured somewhere. \"There is just no trace of him. None whatsoever and that means that for us at least, every potential scenario is open and being investigated.\" Meanwhile Eleftherios Papakalodoukas, the mayor of Symi, shared details of what happened shortly after the doctor vanished, with a woman said to have seen him on the road in Pedi. \"He came back from the beach, some people saw him but then his tracks were lost,\" he said. But the mayor also said rescuers told him that it was 'impossible for Dr Mosley to still be in the Pedi area of the island because it's a 'very small, controlled area, full of people,' reports the BBC. He said: \"So if something happened to him there, we would have found him by now.\" Mr Papakalodoukas added he believed it was likely Dr Mosley either 'followed another path' or had fallen into the sea. The Hellenic National Meteorological Service had issued an excessive heat warning on the day Dr Mosley went missing. Temperatures reached 36 \u00b0C, with Mr Papakalodoukas telling a local Greek newspaper that the heat on the island was 'unbearable', reports The Telegraph. He said that 'one could easily faint in such conditions', adding that the doctor may have taken 'shortcuts'. On Saturday morning one firefighter said there were 10 of his colleagues searching multiple summits because it was too dangerous for large crews to work during the summer months. Stergos Giakoumakis said from near one of the peaks: \"Because it's not so easy to bring here 100 people, especially this period, because it's the most dangerous period. Everything is dry and it is too dangerous for firemen to search.\" Officials at the Foreign Office have also issued a statement regarding the search for him. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British man who is missing in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities.\" Family statement In a moving statement on Saturday afternoon Michael Mosley's wife, Dr Clare Bailey Mosley said: \"It has been three days since Michael left the beach to go for a walk. The longest and most unbearable days for myself and my children. \"The search is ongoing and our family are so incredibly grateful to the people of Symi, the Greek authorities and the British Consulate who are working tirelessly to help find Michael. \"We will not lose hope.\"", "summary": "Dr Michael Mosley went missing on Wednesday on the Greek island of Symi - here's everything we know so far", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/dr-michael-mosley-symi-search-29317764", "image": "https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article29316105.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_thp4927jpg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:20:53", "author": "Damon Wilkinson", "authors": ["Damon Wilkinson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.205}

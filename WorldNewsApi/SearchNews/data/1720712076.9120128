U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert has uncorked a powerful political brew in her quest to clear a field of five Republican primary opponents, all of whom have deeper roots in Colorado\u2019s easternmost district than the second-term congresswoman. That time-tested formula has given Boebert, less than half a year after she abandoned her western Colorado seat to run in the 4th Congressional District, a substantial advantage in the June 25 primary election, said Republican political analyst Kelly Maher. The GOP field is simply too numerous \u2014 and too susceptible to vote splitting \u2014 to keep Boebert from soaring over the top, she said. \u201cShe could win it with a (vote share) in the late 20s,\u201d Maher said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a path for anyone else.\u201d That Boebert may have it all but locked up, in the estimation of several political observers and limited public polling, is just the latest turn in a tumultuous race set off on the Eastern Plains last fall by the retirement announcement of longtime U.S. Rep. Ken Buck. The congresswoman made her surprise district switch weeks later, joining a crowded field that has refused to consolidate enough to present a single strong alternative to Boebert \u2014 though her opponents aren\u2019t ready to concede yet. If there\u2019s a surprise in store at the end of June in the sprawling 4th District, Boebert\u2019s strongest financial competitor suggests it lies in the suburbs south of Denver. Former conservative radio host Deborah Flora, the only other woman in the contest, said assumptions about Boebert\u2019s advantages ignore the shifting demographics of the district and its heavy Front Range suburban component. Nearly half of the 21-county district\u2019s electorate resides in Douglas County alone \u2014 Flora\u2019s home for a half-dozen years. \u201cThere is greater acceptance of Boebert in rural areas. But in the suburbs, they are more averse to the drama we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Flora, 58, said in an interview last week at a meet-and-greet event in Parker. \u201cA lot of people are talking about this being a two-woman race.\u201d The drama surrounding Boebert hit its apex in September, when the congresswoman was tossed from a performance of \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d after audience members complained about her vaping, groping her male companion and recording the performance in Denver\u2019s Buell Theatre. It all has John Manka fed up. The Larkspur Republican, who came to see Flora at her Parker event, said the 37-year-old Boebert has \u201cgone Hollywood,\u201d showing more interest in playing to the cameras and hurling invectives than in governing. \u201cDeborah is much better poised. She is very knowledgeable \u2014 and no baggage,\u201d Manka said. \u201cShe represents what the Republican Party should be.\u201d But that may not be how every voter in the 4th District primary feels, if a poll released last week by Florida-based Kaplan Strategies is to be believed. It showed Boebert with a gargantuan lead over her Republican opponents \u2014 amassing 40% support from a sample of 343 likely primary voters, while her closest competitor mustered no more than 5%. The poll\u2019s margin of error was plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. The survey, conducted May 31 using online and text responses, found that 40% of respondents remained undecided. But Kaplan, which gets a generally reliable pollster rating from data journalism outlet FiveThirtyEight, noted: \u201cImportantly, 44% of undecided voters indicate they might consider voting for Boebert.\u201d It\u2019s the latest sign that Flora and fellow candidates Richard Holtorf, Mike Lynch, Jerry Sonnenberg and Peter Yu are struggling to emerge. Holtorf, a 59-year-old state representative who promotes himself as \u201cpugnacious\u201d and \u201ca fighter\u201d on the campaign trail, hasn\u2019t held back in criticizing Boebert as a carpetbagger who is \u201crunning from a fight on the Western Slope,\u201d as he told The Denver Post in January. A third-generation cattle rancher who lives near Akron, Holtorf said voters won\u2019t choose someone to represent them in Congress who only recently made the district her home. \u201cShe wants to be a celebrity. She wants to be on TV, write a book,\u201d he said of Boebert, who moved earlier this year from Silt, near Rifle, to Windsor, southeast of Fort Collins. \u201cColorado doesn\u2019t want a celebrity; they want a congressperson to lean in and represent them. And not try to be a showboat. And I\u2019m that person.\u201d The Trump factor Colorado\u2019s 4th District has been serving up a cavalcade of twists and turns since the five-term Buck announced in November that he wouldn\u2019t run for reelection. In late December, Boebert said she would seek Buck\u2019s seat. Boebert made the move after it became apparent that her prospects for reelection in the 3rd Congressional District, which she has represented since 2021, had substantially dimmed. Her Democratic opponent, who came within a whisker of beating her in 2022, was far outraising her on the money front. And several fellow Republicans had thrown their hats into the ring to try and bring her down in the June primary. Then, in March, Buck announced he wouldn\u2019t finish out his term, resigning his post more than nine months before the start of the next Congress. His departure triggered a special election to fill the 4th District seat for the rest of the year \u2014 an election that shares the ballot with the primary race. Former Parker Mayor Greg Lopez, a Republican, is taking on Democratic labor activist Trisha Calvarese for the temporary post. Should he win, Lopez has pledged to serve as a placeholder until a new member of Congress is elected in November. Not so for Calvarese, who\u2019s also vying to be on the November ballot, regardless of whether she wins the special election. In the primary for the next term, she faces two Democratic rivals \u2014 military vet Ike McCorkle and engineer and machinist John Padora \u2014 on June 25. The district\u2019s political breakdown is the most favorable to the GOP out of the state\u2019s eight congressional districts, with 37% of voters affiliated as Republicans, 18% as Democrats and 44% unaffiliated \u2014 meaning any Democrat faces a formidable mathematical hurdle. A big question in sorting out the GOP field for the fall is the impact of former President Donald Trump on the race. He endorsed Boebert in the 4th District, calling her a \u201ctrusted America First Fighter.\u201d Boebert has separated herself from her GOP rivals by unabashedly adopting a hardline \u201cdeport-them-all\u201d refrain on illegal immigration, a hallmark issue for the former president. She hasn\u2019t said how far back deportations should go and didn\u2019t respond to a question asking her to clarify the extent of her proposal. \u201cEveryone knows our system is broken and the first step we need to take is closing the border, building the wall and deporting them all,\u201d she said in a written response to questions from The Post. \u201cThis is the top issue this election cycle by far.\u201d That\u2019s not a policy embraced by her Republican opponents. Flora called a wholesale deportation strategy \u201cnot serious.\u201d It\u2019s critical to secure the border, she said, \u201cso those who are coming here for the right reasons can benefit.\u201d Yu, 52, a Windsor businessman who has run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate and House in Colorado, said deportations should be for those \u201cwho came to America illegally and are not contributing to America.\u201d He pointed out in an email response to questions that the country needs immigrant workers, \u201cespecially in our manual labor positions and rural farm areas.\u201d Agriculture is a critical sector in the 4th District, which encompasses nearly 27,000 square miles of farmland from the Wyoming border to the Oklahoma state line and from the Front Range to Kansas\u2019 western flank. \u201cThat is why America needs to have a true guest-worker visa program that allows immigrants to come legally and work and pay taxes,\u201d Yu wrote. \u201cThis will assist farmers who have informed me that they need workers to maintain their labor needs.\u201d Lynch, 55, a state representative who describes himself as an \u201cFFA kid\u201d who \u201cgrew up rural,\u201d called Boebert\u2019s mass-deportation concept \u201csilly\u201d during a televised debate in late May. He echoed the idea that many Colorado farmers rely on foreign workers to plant and harvest their crops every year. Lynch, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who lives in Wellington, is a fan of Trump\u2019s policies but eschews the MAGA \u2014 or \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 moniker, conceding to Boebert the voters who \u201cwill blindly follow anything Trump.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running as a guy that supports Donald Trump because he is our nominee. And I love his policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI also realize that unaffiliated voters are not big fans of Donald Trump. So I\u2019m kind of running that line there.\u201d Trump lost to now-President Joe Biden in Colorado by 13.5 percentage points in 2020. Sonnenberg, 66, a former state senator who\u2019s now a commissioner in Logan County, called Boebert\u2019s deportation pitch \u201cred meat for the base\u201d but said it would be \u201cvirtually impossible to deport them all.\u201d The Sterling farmer and rancher often mentions that he lives in the same house that his father was raised in. He echoed some other candidates\u2019 chief criticism of Boebert: that she\u2019s bombastic, but not effective. \u201cIf you want someone that\u2019s flamboyant and on TV and screams at the president during the State of the Union, I\u2019m not that guy,\u201d he said, referring to a past Boebert moment. \u201cWhen it comes right down to it, I\u2019m confident that the people in the 4th understand what it\u2019s like to be represented by someone who actually lives in the district.\u201d Winnowing went nowhere Sonnenberg called the race to June 25 an \u201cuphill climb,\u201d given Boebert\u2019s overwhelming name recognition. And her fundraising prowess compared to the rest of the field puts her in a \u201cvery good place,\u201d he conceded. In the first quarter of 2024, Boebert raised more than $460,000, giving her a campaign balance of nearly $1 million as of March 31. All told, she had tallied more than $3.4 million in contributions this election cycle, most of which she raised in the 3rd District. Among Boebert\u2019s closest fundraising competitors, Flora landed nearly $180,000 in the first three months of the year and had more than $167,000 cash on hand as of the end of March. Sonnenberg raised $158,000 during the same period and ended with more than $224,000. The next campaign finance reporting deadline is Thursday. The GOP field in the 4th District had as many as a dozen or so candidates jockeying for position until it settled at six contenders in April, following the party assembly and verification of petition signatures by state election officials. Sonnenberg said the idea of winnowing the field even further to give Boebert a formidable rival was discussed by several of the candidates in recent weeks. \u201cIt would be a different story head-to-head,\u201d said Maher, the Republican analyst. But it never happened. And now it\u2019s too late, she said: \u201cIt needed to be done before the ballots were printed.\u201d Ballots began landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes last week. Sandra Hagen Solin, a Loveland-based Republican political and policy strategist, was at a recent event that Boebert attended. The congresswoman, she said, exuded \u201ccelebrity status\u201d as she shook hands and took pictures with people. \u201cIn that moment, I thought: \u2018Yeah, this is done,\u2019 \u201d said Solin, who is unaffiliated with any campaign but has donated to Lynch. \u201cIf other candidates had been there, no one would\u2019ve known them from Adam.\u201d Trump has turned negative publicity about his multiple legal challenges and other controversies into political capital, Solin said, and Boebert has done much the same. \u201cIt would seem that in a typical political environment, circumstances like (the) \u2018Beetlejuice\u2019 (ejection) and the other follies that have followed her would diminish her standing within the congressional district,\u201d Solin said. \u201cShe\u2019s been able to withstand any sort of pushback against her, much the same way Trump is continuing to build support.\u201d In fact, the recent Kaplan poll found that Boebert\u2019s character and judgment were held in higher regard by voters than when the firm last surveyed the district four months ago \u2014 shifting from a 31% positive assessment in February to 41% now. Her negatives on that question slid from 45% to 30% in that time. Boebert has repeatedly apologized for her behavior at the Buell Theatre, saying during a televised debate late last month that she has \u201cowned up to my night out in Denver.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to continue living life in shame and being beaten up by it,\u201d she said. Voters are turning to her, Boebert told The Post in her response to its questions, because they are concerned about real issues affecting the country \u2014 and their district. Her sponsorship of the Pueblo Jobs Act, signed into law in December, will provide 1,000 jobs for constituents in her current district, she said. Boebert also claims to have secured $20 million in infrastructure and water projects for Colorado and often boasts of her role in shutting down the Biden administration\u2019s unpopular Disinformation Governance Board. \u201cI\u2019m hearing the same concerns in the 4th that I hear across Colorado and across America: our southern border is wide open, inflation is out of control, our rural communities are being regulated into poverty, and we don\u2019t have enough fighters in Congress who will actually vote the way they campaign,\u201d she said. Even so, Boebert came under attack last month from both Holtorf and Lynch, who accused the congresswoman during a debate of having passed little in the way of legislation during her more than three years in Congress. Overall, the six GOP primary candidates agree on many issues, including continued support for Trump after his criminal conviction last month, for repealing the Affordable Care Act and for passing a balanced budget amendment. But Boebert stood alone in both voting down aid for Israel and Ukraine and asserting that she would still vote to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. \u201cThey want a fighter\u201d Several candidates not named Boebert say they\u2019re just ramping up their media campaigns now, as the primary election moves into view. Sonnenberg said his campaign recently spent $65,000 on TV, radio and social media ads. Lynch said his campaign has been \u201cliterally everywhere, all the time.\u201d Yu said he has spent eight hours a day for the last five months knocking on at least 500 doors each day, reaching what he estimates to be more than 35,000 voters face-to-face. Holtorf said it\u2019s about campaigning hard. \u201cSo many (candidates) to choose from \u2014 a lot of people are still trying to figure this out,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people have not made up their mind.\u201d But Steve Peck, chair of the Douglas County Republican Party, says edging out Boebert is a tall order \u2014 perhaps too tall. He stressed that he\u2019s staying neutral in the race, given his role in the party. \u201cI think it just boils down to \u2014 even though she\u2019s not an incumbent from this seat \u2014 it\u2019s incredibly strong\u201d to have that status, said Peck. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of high name ID, having access to the committees and votes, political intel and then, of course, donors. Donors want to back a strong horse.\u201d He\u2019s been telling Republicans to keep hammering immigration, inflation, and law and order as campaign issues. \u201cI guess the bottom line is CD4 is a very red district,\u201d Peck said. \u201cThe base of the Republican Party has been demanding change for a long time, and we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve been heard. People like Lauren Boebert and Donald Trump acknowledge the base. They hear the base. They don\u2019t say one thing and do the other.\u201d Douglas County Commissioner George Teal sees it similarly. He initially backed former state lawmaker Ted Harvey in the primary. When Harvey didn\u2019t make the cut, he turned to Boebert. \u201cFour of every 10 Republicans I\u2019m talking to love Lauren,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a majority, but it\u2019s an absolute plurality. Lauren \u2014 they love what she says, they love the issues she\u2019s willing to die for.\u201d While Flora pushes the notion of a big-tent Republican Party \u2014 the 12-year KNUS talk radio host is fond of calling herself a \u201cReagan Republican\u201d \u2014 Teal isn\u2019t sure that\u2019s what the voters seek this time around. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Reagan-era statesman is what these Republican voters of the 4th Congressional District want right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want a fighter.\u201d Stay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.", "summary": "Less than half a year since Lauren Boebert switched districts, analysts say the congresswoman has a substantial advantage in the crowded Republican primary against lesser-known contenders.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2024/06/09/lauren-boebert-deborah-flora-colorado-4th-congressional-district-republican-primary/", "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TDP-L-Farm-Bureau-debate-RJSS-34863.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:46", "author": "John Aguilar,Seth Klamann", "authors": ["John Aguilar", "Seth Klamann"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.136}

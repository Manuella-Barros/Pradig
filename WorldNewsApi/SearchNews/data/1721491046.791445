Soussana detailed for The New York Times being sexually assaulted while held in Gaza, before she was released, along with a group of other hostages, during a November ceasefire that briefly suspended fighting between Israel and Hamas. Harris said that after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, \u201cI saw images of bloody Israeli women abducted.\u201d \u201cThen it came to light that Hamas committed rape and gang rape at the Nova music festival,\u201d the vice president said, referring to the Tribe of Nova music that was overrun by Hamas militants. \u201cAnd women\u2019s bodies were found naked from the waist down, hands tied behind their back and shot in the head.\u201d Such accounts of atrocities are not new, but Harris detailing accusations of sexual violence surrounding the Israel-Hamas war comes as the Biden administration is working to broker another ceasefire to pause the fighting in Gaza. Harris on Monday urged Hamas to accept a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal. She also said she heard stories from former Israeli hostages about what they \u201cwitnessed and heard in captivity,\u201d and spoke with Soussana, who the vice president said \u201chas bravely come forward with her account of sexual violence while she was held captive by Hamas.\u201d \u201cThese testimonies, I fear, will only increase as more hostages are released,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe cannot look away. And we will not be silent.\u201d Hamas has denied sexually assaulting people during the Oct. 7, 2024, attack, or the hostages it has held since, and false reports of abuse have sometimes helped fueled the conflict between the militant group and Israel. But a United Nations report released in March found \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe Hamas committed rape, \u201csexualized torture,\u201d and other cruel and inhumane treatment of women during its Oct. 7, 2024, attack. The same report found there are \u201creasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing.\u201d The vice president also said her \u201cheart breaks for all these survivors and their families, and for all the pain and suffering over the last eight months in Israel and in Gaza.\u201d Harris said \u201csexual violence has been a tactic of war since ancient times,\u201d though she noted that the international community has made recent progress recognizing it \u201cas an attack on peace, stability and human rights.\u201d She said that the Biden administration had worked to prevent such violence by doing things like providing rape kits and heath care for survivors and helping to train militaries and back international peacekeepers. The U.S. has also imposed economic sanctions on individuals associated with conflicts in places like Iraq, Sudan and the Central African Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. The crimes persist and, globally, our system of accountability remains inadequate,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMore must be done.\u201d", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2hhcnJpcy1jb25mbGljdC1yZWxhdGVkLXNleHVhbC12aW9sZW5jZS1oYW1hcy1pc3JhZWwtNzA5MzRhZTljYTcyNTVjMGFlZjQ4ZTE5MjQ2NDRjZTfSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Harris meets with former Israeli hostage who described being sexually assaulted in Gaza</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/harris-conflict-related-sexual-violence-hamas-israel-70934ae9ca7255c0aef48e1924644ce7", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/af2a671/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5445x3063+0+284/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fac%2Fb3%2F5c345d7bfb2d694e48d4da16a632%2Fef0032862ef14bcea8082892dbffcc5a", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:26:01", "author": "Will Weissert", "authors": ["Will Weissert"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.225}

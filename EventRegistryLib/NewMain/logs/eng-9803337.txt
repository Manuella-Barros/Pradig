border.\n\nFour villages were being evacuated after a local state of emergency was declared in the Lipetsk municipal district.\n\nArtamonov dismissed calls circulating on social media that the entire city was being evacuated as a campaign of \"psychological warfare\" by Ukraine.\n\nThere was no word from Kyiv on the situation in Lipetsk.\n\nThe attacks come after Russia said it was engaged in fierce battles in the Kursk region after 1,000 Ukrainian troops supported by tanks and armoured vehicles launched a cross-border raid on August 6.\n\nThe Kursk assault appears to be the most

It involved around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.\n\nKiev has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nEarly Friday, official Russian news agencies TASS and RIA Novosti reported a fire at a military airfield in the neighbouring Lipetsk region citing the local emergencies ministry directorate, though neither outlet offered a cause.\n\nThe reports came just hours after regional governor Igor Artamonov announced on Telegram at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) that Lipetsk had \"been subjected to a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack\", later adding a local power facility was damaged.\n\nIn a subsequent message, Artamonov urged residents to ignore calls on social media to leave Lipetsk -- saying they were \"spread by the enemy in order to sow panic\" -- only to reverse course less than an hour later.\n\n\"To eliminate the consequences of the detonation of explosive objects, a state of emergency is introduced in Lipetsk municipal district,\" he said in a post at around 4:00 am, listing evacuation orders for four

wounded as a result of the attack.\n\nHe later announced around 7:00 am that the red threat level for the city had been lifted.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said its forces shot down 75 Ukrainian

began on Tuesday.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into Kursk.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kiev, and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush it.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has expressed support for Kiev without

It involved around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nEarly Friday, official Russian news agencies TASS and RIA Novosti reported a fire at a military airfield in the neighbouring Lipetsk region citing the local emergencies ministry directorate, though neither outlet offered a cause.\n\nThe reports came just hours after regional governor Igor Artamonov announced on Telegram at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) that Lipetsk had \"been subjected to a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack\", later adding a local power facility was damaged.\n\nIn a subsequent message, Artamonov urged residents to ignore calls on social media to leave Lipetsk -- saying they were \"spread by the enemy in order to sow panic\" -- only to reverse course less than an hour later.\n\n\"To eliminate the consequences of the detonation of explosive objects, a state of emergency is introduced in Lipetsk municipal district,\" he said in a post at around 4:00 am, listing evacuation orders for four settlements on the outskirts of Lipetsk city.\n\n\"Temporary accommodation points and transport are being prepared.\"\n\nArtamonov said preliminary reports suggested at least six people had been wounded as a result of the attack.\n\nHe later announced around 7:00 am that the red threat level for the city had been lifted.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said its forces shot down 75 Ukrainian drones overnight including 26 in the Belgorod region which borders Ukraine, 19 over Lipetsk, seven over Kursk, and 13 over the annexed Crimean peninsula and surrounding Black Sea.\n\nMore from this section KFC worker allegedly bullied wakes up from coma after overdose Anti-whaling activist Watson says Greenland arrest 'political' Tom Cruise at Olympics would be 'disgrace', say French anti-cult groups\n\nSeven nautical drones headed for Crimea were also destroyed, it added.\n\n- Cross-border gains -\n\nLipetsk city is about 330 kilometres (210 miles) from the Ukrainian border with Russia's Kursk region, where pro-Kyiv forces for days have been waging an offensive on Russian territory.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains since the push began on Tuesday.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into Kursk.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush it.\n\nThe US State Department has expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nbur-smw/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It involved around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nEarly Friday, official Russian news agencies TASS and RIA Novosti reported a fire at a military airfield in the neighbouring Lipetsk region citing the local emergencies ministry directorate, though neither outlet offered a cause.\n\nThe reports came just hours after regional governor Igor Artamonov announced on Telegram at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) that Lipetsk had \"been subjected to a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack\", later adding a local power facility was damaged.\n\nIn a subsequent message, Artamonov urged residents to ignore calls on social media to leave Lipetsk -- saying they were \"spread by the enemy in order to sow panic\" -- only to reverse course less than an hour later.\n\n\"To eliminate the consequences of the detonation of explosive objects, a state of emergency is introduced in Lipetsk municipal district,\" he said in a post at around 4:00 am, listing evacuation orders for four settlements on the outskirts of Lipetsk city.\n\n\"Temporary accommodation points and transport are being prepared.\"\n\nArtamonov said preliminary reports suggested at least six people had been wounded as a result of the attack.\n\nHe later announced around 7:00 am that the red threat level for the city had been lifted.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said its forces shot down 75 Ukrainian drones overnight including 26 in the Belgorod region which borders Ukraine, 19 over Lipetsk, seven over Kursk, and 13 over the annexed Crimean peninsula and surrounding Black Sea.\n\nSeven nautical drones headed for Crimea were also destroyed, it added.\n\n- Cross-border gains -\n\nLipetsk city is about 330 kilometres (210 miles) from the Ukrainian border with Russia's Kursk region, where pro-Kyiv forces for days have been waging an offensive on Russian territory.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains since the push began on Tuesday.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into Kursk.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush it.\n\nThe US State Department has expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nbur-smw/ach\n\nMore from this section\n\nPromoting the Magic of Hollywood with a Summer Cleanup\n\nLutheran Home's 'Best Friend's Guide to Dementia' Series

The deadliest incident of the kind to date occurred in late December 2023, when a Ukrainian attack claimed the lives of 25 people and left more than 100 wounded in the city of Belgorod.\n\nMoscow have repeatedly accused Kiev of using Western-supplied arms to \"indiscriminately\" fire at civilians.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly warned that the delivery of weapons and other military aid to Kiev makes Western countries de facto direct participants to the conflict.", "source": {"uri": "irishsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_districts_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal districts of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lipetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lipetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Artamonov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Igor Artamonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1723184047.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803337", "eventUri": "eng-9803337", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

forces shot down 75 Ukrainian drones overnight from Thursday to Friday, including 26 in the Belgorod region which borders Ukraine, 19 over Lipetsk, seven over Kursk, and 13 over the annexed Crimean peninsula and surrounding Black Sea.\n\nSeven nautical drones headed for Crimea were also destroyed, it added.\n\nLipetsk city is about 210 miles from the Ukrainian border with Russia's Kursk region, where pro-Kyiv forces for days have been waging an offensive on Russian territory.\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region over the past few days appears to be the most significant attack on

officially taken responsibility for the operation but Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Mr Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into Kursk.\n\nVladimir Putin, the Russian president, has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv.\n\nClick here to view this content.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Russia has given only scarce updates as it seeks to strike a balance between denouncing the escalation and avoiding panic. Agence France-Presse\n\nKYIV -- Ukraine pressed on with a major cross-border incursion into Russia, where state media and local officials reported early Friday a fire at a military airfield and \"massive\" drone attack hundreds of kilometers from the border.\n\nThe cross-frontier offensive in Kursk region over the past few days appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since the war in Ukraine began, involving around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armored vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\nREAD: Zelensky says Russia must feel the war as Ukraine presses attack\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nEarly Friday, official Russian news agencies TASS and RIA Novosti reported a fire at a military airfield in the neighbouring Lipetsk region citing the local emergencies ministry directorate, though neither outlet offered a cause.\n\nThe reports came just hours after regional governor Igor Artamonov announced on Telegram at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) that Lipetsk had \"been subjected to a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack\", later adding a local power facility was damaged.\n\nREAD: Thousands evacuated as Russia battles major Ukrainian border incursion\n\nIn a subsequent message, Artamonov urged residents to ignore calls on social media to leave Lipetsk -- saying they were \"spread by the enemy in order to sow panic\" -- only to reverse course less than an hour later.\n\n\"To eliminate the consequences of the detonation of explosive objects, a state of emergency is introduced in Lipetsk municipal district,\" he said in a post at around 4:00 am, listing evacuation orders for four settlements on the outskirts of Lipetsk city.\n\n\"Temporary accommodation points and transport are being prepared.\"\n\nArtamonov said preliminary reports suggested at least six people had been wounded as a result of the attack.\n\nHe later announced around 7:00 am that the red threat level for the city had been lifted.\n\nCross-border gains\n\nLipetsk city is about 330 kilometers (210 miles) from the Ukrainian border with Russia's Kursk region, where pro-Kyiv forces for days have been waging an offensive on Russian territory.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains since the push began on Tuesday.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into Kursk.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush it.\n\nThe US State Department has expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors":

what the **** is going on,' one observer can be heard declaring on video that was circulated on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRegional governor Igor Artamonov confirmed on Telegram at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) that Lipetsk had 'been subjected to a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack', later adding a local power facility was damaged.\n\nIn a subsequent message, Artamonov urged residents to ignore calls on social media to leave Lipetsk - saying they were 'spread by the enemy in order to sow panic' - only to reverse course less than an hour later.\n\n'To eliminate the consequences of the detonation of explosive objects, a state of emergency is introduced in Lipetsk municipal district,' he said in a post at around 4:00 am, listing evacuation orders for four settlements on the outskirts of Lipetsk city.\n\n'Temporary accommodation points and transport are being prepared.'\n\nArtamonov said preliminary reports suggested at least six people had been wounded as a result of the attack.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said its forces shot down 75 Ukrainian drones overnight including 26 in the Belgorod region which borders Ukraine, 19 over Lipetsk, seven over Kursk, and 13 over the annexed Crimean peninsula and surrounding Black Sea.\n\nSeven nautical drones headed for Crimea were also destroyed, it added.\n\nBut the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains since the push began on Tuesday.\n\n'Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast' in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control' all of that territory.\n\nZelensky has not commented in detail on the Kursk invasion but said late on Thursday that Russia must feel the consequences of the fighting.\n\n'The more pressure is put on Russia, the closer peace will be,' he said.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were 'continuing to destroy' armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was 'thwarting attempts to break through' deeper into Kursk.\n\nBut Russian state TV reporter Aleksandr Sladkov said Ukraine had 'partial or full control of 11 settlements in the Sudzhansky district'.\n\nThere was undisguised fury from residents of the district around the border town Sudzha, some of whom made a video appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin angrily attacking his military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov for 'lying' in claiming that the Ukrainian advance had been halted.\n\n'Foreign troops with NATO equipment entered our land,' they complained, upset that they are facing the same foreign occupation that Putin has inflicted on large regions of Ukraine.\n\n'In a few hours our town was turned into ruins. We lost our land, our homes. We fled under shelling.'\n\n'We want to appeal to you. We want to ask for help,' said their spokeswoman.\n\n'We are alone. Our children are afraid to sleep at night... Recently, the Chief of General Staff [General Valery Gerasimov] told you that the situation is under control.\n\n'This is a lie. This lie allows civilians to die.\n\n'Today there is huge heavy fighting in Sudzha district, Gornev district. We have no evacuation of Sudzha district. Help us!'\n\nPutin has called the incursion a 'large-scale provocation' by Kyiv.\n\nThe US State Department meanwhile has expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.",

airbase", "body": "KYIV - Ukraine pressed on with a major cross-border incursion into Russia on Aug 9, also launching a significant air attack on a Russian airfield hundreds of kilometres behind the front lines.\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive into Russia's western Kursk region, launched on Aug 6, appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since Moscow invaded in February 2022.\n\nRussia says around 1,000 Ukrainian troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks were involved in the initial attack, though it has since claimed to have destroyed many more pieces of hardware.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Aug 8 that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\nUkraine said on Aug 9 it had carried out a massive air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280km from the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nThe local Russian governor Igor Artamonov reported a \"massive\" drone attack overnight and Russian state news agencies said the airfield was on fire.\n\n\"Last night, the Ukrainian Defence Forces attacked the Lipetsk airfield,\" Ukraine's General Staff said in a post on Telegram.\n\nIt said it had struck \"warehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities\" and that a \"massive fire broke out\" with \"multiple detonations.\"\n\nMr Artamonov cancelled several public events in the region and issued evacuation orders for districts close to the air base.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said it destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 19 over the Lipetsk region and seven over Kursk, where Ukraine's four-day incursion has focused.\n\nSeveral nautical drones headed for the annexed peninsula of Crimea were also destroyed, it said.\n\nUkraine's surprise offensive into the Kursk region has appeared to catch Russia off guard, and triggered harsh criticism of the defence ministry by influential military bloggers.\n\nSenior Kyiv officials have stayed tight-lipped over the incursion, though some, including Mr Zelensky have appeared to justify the attack.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Mr Zelensky said on Aug 8, without directly referring to the offensive.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com",

The Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region over the past few days appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since the war in Ukraine began in 2022 and has prompted thousands of Russians to flee their homes.\n\nKyiv's forces staged an overnight missile attack on a column of Russian troops trundling through the Rylsky district of Kursk, where a series of powerful explosions sparked more blazes and spewed debris over a nearby highway. The Russian units are said to have sustained hundreds of casualties in the strike as macabre images, snapped by shocked passers-by, showed military vehicles lying charred and twisted in the dirt.\n\nThat strike came as a precision drone assault triggered another salvo of huge blasts at Lipetsk airfield that whipped up a terrifying inferno and caused the evacuation of hundreds of nearby residents. Kyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to 'feel' the consequences of its invasion. 'Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,' Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nThe consequences of the missile strike on Russian troops near the village of Oktyabrskoye in Rylsky, roughly 25 miles from the border with Ukraine, are yet to be fully established. But more than a dozen armoured vehicles and trucks were said to be carrying hundreds of soldiers when the missiles struck. The huge blow enraged pro-war military channels in Russia who claimed it showed the sheer incompetence of their own military commanders.\n\nRespected warblogging channel Military Informer, with 607,000 followers, declared: 'In order to hit a convoy with [missiles] aimed at a considerable distance and corrected by satellite navigation, it is necessary that this very convoy, like a herd of stupid sheep, stood in the open and did not move anywhere until a reconnaissance drone found it, transmitted information and worked on it. Not only that, but they left people sitting in the backs of the trucks, which turned the destruction of the convoy into a natural massacre. Passing locals have already filmed everything, as the consequences were left standing until morning.'\n\n'All this is a consequence not only of the impenetrable stupidity of a particular [commander] who organised the movement of the column near the border for the third year and then its standing, but also of the general situation of chaotic pulling of reserves to the area of the rupture, for which they were not prepared at all,' Military Informer added.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine hit a major Russia bomb store and military airfield in Lipetsk overnight. Lipetsk city is about 210 miles from the Ukrainian border with Russia's Kursk region, where pro-Kyiv forces have been waging their ground offensive. The punishing strikes caused the Russian ammunition dumps to detonate, resulting in a massive blaze at the airfield and prompted authorities to evacuate hundreds of people from nearby towns. 'The entire airfield is on fire, look - what the **** is going on,' one observer can be heard declaring on video that was circulated on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRegional governor Igor Artamonov confirmed on Telegram at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) that Lipetsk had 'been subjected to a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack', later adding a local power facility was damaged. In a subsequent message, Artamonov urged residents to ignore calls on social media to leave Lipetsk - saying they were 'spread by the enemy in order to sow panic' - only to reverse course less than an hour later. 'To eliminate the consequences of the detonation of explosive objects, a state of emergency is introduced in Lipetsk municipal district,' he said in a post at around 4:00 am, listing evacuation orders for four settlements on the outskirts of Lipetsk city. 'Temporary accommodation points and transport are being prepared.'\n\nArtamonov said preliminary reports suggested at least six people had been wounded as a result of the attack. Russia's defence ministry said its forces shot down 75 Ukrainian drones overnight including 26 in the Belgorod region which borders Ukraine, 19 over Lipetsk, seven over Kursk, and 13 over the annexed Crimean peninsula and surrounding Black Sea. Seven nautical drones headed for Crimea were also destroyed, it added. But the independent U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains since the push began on Tuesday.\n\n'Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast' in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment. It cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control' all of that territory. Zelensky has not commented in detail on the Kursk invasion but said late on Thursday that Russia must feel the consequences of the fighting. 'The more pressure is put on Russia, the closer peace will be,' he said.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were 'continuing to destroy' armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back. It said it had rushed in reserves and was 'thwarting attempts to break through' deeper into Kursk. But Russian state TV reporter Aleksandr Sladkov said Ukraine had 'partial or full control of 11 settlements in the Sudzhansky district'.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

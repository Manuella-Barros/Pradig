Mikinleyh (@mikinleyh) has reached over 159,000 likes on her viral video as of this writing. She added an on-screen caption that says, \u201cOur clothes look cheap and not worth our money.\u201d To start, Mikinleyh prefaces that she is going to share a \u201cstrong opinion.\u201d She says the clothes being advertised today \u201clook like sh*t,\u201d and customers are \u201cbeing taken advantage of.\u201d \u201cLet me clarify,\u201d she says. Mikinleyh addresses that the clothing brands she believes are taking advantage of shoppers are fast fashion brands. Fast fashion refers to \u201clow-priced but stylish clothing that moves quickly from design to retail stores to meet trends,\u201d according to Investopedia. The first example Mikinleyh uses is the clothing brand Princess Polly. She says there is currently a green dress from Princess Polly that is trending on TikTok. While Mikinleyh does not show the dress, the search terms\u2019 results in the comments section suggest she may be referring to the brand\u2019s green Kenzie dress, which comes in both mini and maxi. \u201cDon\u2019t buy that dress,\u201d Mikinleyh says. \u201cEvery person I\u2019ve seen it on, it looks bad.\u201d She adds that she thinks this because the fabric looks \u201ccheap.\u201d \u201cThe straps look like they\u2019re gonna break off in a second,\u201d she adds. Mikinleyh says despite these issues, the dress likely costs at least $90 \u201cbecause these brands, they know we aren\u2019t looking for quality, and we\u2019re looking for what\u2019s trending.\u201d Princess Polly\u2019s website lists the Kenzi mini dress at $68 and the maxi at $75. Mikinleyh says customers\u2019 tendency to just go for what\u2019s popular gives brands the opportunity to use the cheapest materials they want \u201cand jack up the price \u2026 just because it\u2019s a trending item.\u201d \u201cAnd then we fall for it,\u201d she adds. Mikinleyh admits that there have been times she ordered a big selection of clothes from Princess Polly or Shein, but she says she ended up giving them to a thrift store due to the poor material of the clothing. How to avoid cheap fabrics Next, Mikinleyh says she wants to help by educating viewers on clothing materials. \u201cWhen you\u2019re buying things, look in the description and look at what material it is,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna tell you a lot about how the fabric and the clothing item is gonna fit and hold up through time.\u201d The first fabric Mikinleyh suggests staying away from is polyester. She says polyester is the cheapest, fastest, and easiest fabric to make. According to GoonVean Fibres, \u201cPolyester consists of synthetic materials, so it\u2019s usually less expensive than natural fibres, making polyester a good choice for businesses looking for budget-friendly manufacturing options.\u201d Mikinleyh says, \u201cBasically everything from Princess Polly, Shein, all of those things are mostly made out of polyester.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very thin material \u2026 it catches lint really, really easily,\u201d she adds. The fabric that Mikinleyh says is a \u201cstep up from polyester\u201d is cotton. Mikinleyh says that while shopping, \u201cit\u2019s gonna be hard to find things that don\u2019t have polyester in it unless it\u2019s really high-end.\u201d So, she suggests customers \u201clook for more cotton in your T-shirts than polyester.\u201d Barnhardt Cotton states, \u201cCotton is natural, breathable, absorbent, and sustainable. Polyester, on the other hand, is a synthetic fiber that doesn\u2019t breathe well, repels water, and isn\u2019t sustainable.\u201d According to Mikinleyh, some good options for quality material T-shirts are Gap and Brandy Melville. The next few fabrics Mikinleyh says you should purchase are \u201cmodal, viscose, and lyocell.\u201d She says these three fabrics are plant derivatives and are made in a way similar to silk. \u201cBut they\u2019re man-made, rather than silk is made from a silkworm,\u201d she says. Robert Owen Undershirts confirms that \u201cViscose, modal and lyocell are all made from plant material.\u201d The site adds, \u201cThe important thing to remember is that they may be man-made but they are not synthetic. In fact, as fibres that are man-made from a natural product, we might call them semi-synthetic fabrics.\u201d Mikinleyh says these three fabrics are a \u201clittle bit higher end\u201d but that you will have a lower price than fabrics like cashmere and silk. Since the fabrics are man-made, she says, \u201cit lowers the cost of the fabric.\u201d Before ending her video, Mikinleyh says that her overall message is to \u201cbe careful when you\u2019re buying things.\u201d \u201cLook at the fabric; think about the quality over quantity,\u201d she adds. \u201cOvertime, those polyester items are going to wear out. You might have a year max.\u201d @mikinleyh \u266c original sound \u2013 mikinleyh Viewers in the comments section agree with Mikinleyh and express that they are tired of fast fashion and cheap material clothing. \u201cI just want cotton, linen, wool, ANYTHING NATURAL PLZ \u2026 we\u2019re in a polyester pandemic,\u201d one said. \u201cPrincess POLYESTER,\u201d another adds. A viewer with over 40,000 likes wrote, \u201cI miss quality clothing.\u201d The Daily Dot reached out to Mikinleyh via the TikTok comments section, Shein via email, and Princess Polly via media contact form.

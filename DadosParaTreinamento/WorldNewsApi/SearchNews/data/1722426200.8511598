Unbeknownst to many green thumbs, actions such as nurturing the notorious Japanese Knotweed or putting up excessively tall hedges can lead to hefty fines, potentially tapping your wallet for a steep \u00a35,000. Anna McEntee from Compare the Market cautions diligent homeowners to familiarise themselves with relevant legalese or touch base with local planning officials prior to embarking on any grand gardening expedition. In a bid to keep residents on the straight and narrow and shield them from exorbitant penalties during the sun-soaked months, Anna has shared insight into the most 'common' garden offences and the hefty costs that could follow.

Fine: You could be hit with fines sky-high at \u00a35,000 plus jail time of a maximum two years, reports the Mirror. Regulation: Citing the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Known for its rapid growth and stubborn resilience, Japanese Knotweed lurks as a botanical menace tougher to tackle than most plant pests. The Wildlife and Countryside Act deems it criminal to plant Japanese Knotweed or let it invade wild spaces. While it's not against the law per se to have it on your plot, you could be fined up to \u00a35,000 if it encroaches onto public terrain. Natural Resources Wales warns that activities like \"strimming, flailing or dumping\" knotweed-laden debris could lead to legal trouble. Should any careless disposal result in the weed wreaking havoc on natural environments, Britons could face up to two years behind bars. High hedges and fences Fine: \u00a31,000. Regulation: The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. Many homeowners opt for tall fences and hedges to maintain their privacy. However, if these barriers are excessively high, they can cause disruption to neighbours and potentially lead to fines. Under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, if a neighbour lodges a complaint about the height of a fence or hedge, the local authority will step in to investigate whether it significantly affects the neighbour's enjoyment of their property. If found to be disruptive, the authority can issue a notice demanding the homeowner to lower the height. Failure to comply can result in a fine of up to \u00a31,000. Noise nuisance Fine: \u00a31,000. Regulation: The Environmental Protection Act 1990. While enjoying the outdoors in pleasant weather is a delight, residents should keep their noise levels in check to avoid breaching regulations. According to the Environmental Protection Act, noise that \"unreasonably and substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of a home or other premises\" is considered a \"statutory nuisance\". If a noise complaint is lodged, the council can issue a warning to cease or limit the noise. Ignoring this warning and continuing the noise can lead to fines of up to \u00a3110 for homes and \u00a3500 for licensed premises, which can rise to \u00a31,000 or more if not paid within 14 days. Non-native plant species Fine: Unlimited fine and potential for two years imprisonment. Regulation: The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Gardeners could be hit with a hefty fine if they plant non-native species, whether by accident or on purpose. These plants can potentially wreak havoc on the ecosystem if they're introduced into environments where they don't naturally occur. Under section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, residents could face an unlimited fine, and even up to two years in jail if they plant a banned species. Hose pipe ban Fine: \u00a31,000. Regulation: Section 76 of the Water Industry Act 1991. From watering the garden to washing the car, many people will be reaching for their hose pipe this summer - but it's crucial to do your homework first. In the event of a hose pipe ban, these common activities are off-limits, with a few exceptions. For instance, if you've just laid a new lawn in the last 28 days, you can use your hosepipe to water the fresh grass. These bans are put in place by water companies when there is a high demand for water and a lower supply, especially during the hot summer months. If someone is caught using their hosepipe unnecessarily during the ban, they could be slapped with a \u00a31,000 fine. Anna remarked: \"Home insurance policies usually include coverage for structures like sheds, fences, and decking, but changes to these structures can affect coverage. Make sure to review your policy terms to understand what is covered, and check the exclusions and conditions. If you're planning to make significant changes in your garden, inform your insurer to ensure your policy still meets your needs.\" The specialist further noted: \"Home insurance can also be affected by garden maintenance and safety. Neglecting garden maintenance could potentially lead to claims being rejected if damage results from poor upkeep. Insurers may also have guidelines about features that pose safety risks, such as trampolines or swimming pools, so always check with your insurer before making changes to your garden to avoid compromising your coverage.\"", "summary": "With temperatures expected to soar to 31C this week, many green-fingered folk will be making the most of their outdoor spaces - but some may find themselves accidentally breaking laws", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/gardening-mistakes-could-land-you-29426998", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29426996.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-174809096.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:30:00", "author": "Annabal Bagdi,Freya Hodgson", "authors": ["Annabal Bagdi", "Freya Hodgson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.08}

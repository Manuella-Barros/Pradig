The event, which is regarded as the biggest metropolitan festival in the UK, got underway on Saturday (June 8) with a reported 58,000 attendees. The event at the Bury park will continue today with a similar expected number of visitors. On Saturday, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has confirmed that a total of 26 people were arrested either inside the Heaton Park site, or within the surrounding streets and entry gates.

This includes eight people, who were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply nitrous oxide. Two people were arrested on suspicion of possessing class A drugs, whilst one other person was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. Another person was arrested for possession of an offensive weapon, whilst another was arrested on suspicion of robbery. GMP has told the Manchester Evening News that, out of the 26 people, 19 were taken into police custody, whilst the remaining seven were released whilst investigations continue. Before the festival even began, on Friday afternoon, a 34-year-old man was arrested by police on suspicion of possession with intent to supply. At around 3pm on June 7, security staff at the festival detained a suspicious male within the event site, with GMP reporting that the staff seized significant quantities of nitrous oxide, which is now a class C drug, from the individual. On Sunday morning (June 8), three males - two aged 22 and one aged 23 - were arrested by traffic officers after they were spotted \u2018high as kites\u2019 behind the wheel. The three men, who had been travelling from Bristol to attend Parklife, were \u2018seen driving all sucking on balloons with NoX [nitrogen oxide]\u2019 and were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply. Throughout the weekend, a dispersal order for Parklife Festival is in place until Monday morning. The dispersal order gives police heightened powers to break up large groups and deal with any anti-social behaviour, and will be in place across Heaton Park and its surrounding streets until 4am Monday June 10. Speaking about the arrests on Saturday, Superintendent Andy Sidebotham, who leads for the policing operation for Parklife, said: \u201cWe had a successful first day of Parklife Festival, the vast majority of revellers enjoyed themselves in the sun, with only 26 people being arrested out of 58,000 attendees. \u201cThe drugs and weapon intercepted yesterday could have serious and fatal consequences if they managed to get inside the festival site. \u201cThe vast majority of these arrests were the result of proactive work between GMP and event security staff, and a thorough search regime in place on the entry gates across Heaton Park. I would like to thank our partners for their continued hard work in ensuring Parklife Festival has a robust security plan in place to protect the public.\u201d", "summary": "The 26 people arrested on the first day of Parklife 2024 include eight people who were arrested on suspicion of being in possession of nitrous oxide", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/26-people-arrested-first-day-29322732", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29321699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_060624parklife2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:40:05", "author": "Adam Maidment", "authors": ["Adam Maidment"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.124}

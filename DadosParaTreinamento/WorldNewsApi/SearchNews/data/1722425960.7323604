The initiative seeks to create the country\u2019s most efficient network of Catholic schools, as detailed in a recent press release of the Foundation. The substantial donation, which will be administered by the Big Shoulders Foundation over the next ten years, is geared to improving the quality, accessibility and sustainability of Catholic schools in Indiana. Bill Hanna, Executive Director of the Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation, pointed out the entity\u2019s commitment to these educational institutions, which have been essential pillars in the region for decades. \u201cWe want to ensure that all students, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sex, religion or financial capacity, have access to a high quality education,\u201d said Hanna. The funds will be allocated primarily to students with fewer economic and educational resources, and also to the formation of docents, the development of leadership, improvement of infrastructures and student support services. A Vote of Confidence for Catholic Education Monsignor Robert J. McClory, Bishop of Gary, Indiana, celebrated the donation as a significant support to Catholic education in the region. \u201cThis generous gift is a unique opportunity for our diocese to fulfil its mission with renewed enthusiasm, supporting families and improving our schools to become an exemplary model of Catholic education,\u201d said Monsignor McClory. Twenty Catholic schools in Indiana will be directly benefitted with this donation. The funds will not only make possible improvements in the installations and educational resources, but also the creation of programs that foment students\u2019 integral development and the strengthening of the educational community. The Big Shoulders Foundation, inspired by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin and established in 1986 by a group of business and civic leaders, has been committed to guaranteeing children access to quality education in disadvantaged areas of Indiana. The organization invests US$40 million annually in scholarships, helping thousands of students to access educational opportunities which they would otherwise not be in their reach. With the new US$150 million injection, the Big Shoulders Foundation will be able to expand its impact significantly, consolidating its mission to support the neediest communities and strengthen the Catholic schools network in the region. This historic contribution not only underscores the importance of Catholic education in the community\u2019s development, but also establishes an inspiring precedent for future investments in the education sector. The hope is that this donation will inspire other entities to follow the example and contribute to the creation of a better future for all students. Thank you for reading our content.

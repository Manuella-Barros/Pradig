{"id": 243228734, "title": "NBA Rumors: Pistons Decline Evan Fournier's $19M Contract Option Before Free Agency", "text": "After being acquired by the Detroit Pistons in a midseason trade, veteran guard Evan Fournier will be in search of a new team this offseason. According to The Athletic's James L. Edwards III, the Pistons are declining the $19 million option on Fournier's contract for the 2024-25 season, making him an unrestricted free agent. Fournier had spent the last year and a half toiling away on the New York Knicks bench before being shipped to Detroit at the 2024 trade deadline as part of a six-player deal. He went from a veteran-laden Knicks team to becoming the second-oldest player on the Pistons, who continued to struggle amid their ongoing rebuild and finished the year ranked last in the Eastern Conference with a 14-68 record. After playing just three games with New York prior to the Feb. 8 trade, Fournier appeared in 29 games in Detroit and was primarily used in a bench role, averaging 7.2 points in 18.7 minutes of action. The 31-year-old began his NBA career in 2012 after being selected with the 20th pick in the draft by the Denver Nuggets. He has also played for the Orlando Magic and Boston Celtics in his career, and in his prime, he was a reliable source of offensive production. Fournier shouldn't be counted on as a primary offensive option at this stage, but his veteran presence would likely be welcomed on most rosters across the league. He should have a solid market for his services this summer.", "summary": "After being acquired by the Detroit Pistons in a midseason trade, veteran guard Evan Fournier will be in search of a new team this offseason.

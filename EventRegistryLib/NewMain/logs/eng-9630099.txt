I think everybody has seen the effects that 'Drive to Survive' had on Formula 1 racing, 'Full Swing' has done a lot for golf, and obviously the storytelling that's involved is unique and very different.\"\n\nIt's another step in the league's evolutionary process showing more player personalities in a game that has forever been defined by teams and not individuals.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt's a leaguewide endeavour, but the gist of it is similar to what the Toronto Raptors have been doing for a while with its \"Open Gym\" series.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAside from Nylander, other stars in this new series include Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid and his teammate Leon Draisaitl, Florida Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk, New York Rangers captain Jacob Trouba, Boston Bruins teammates David Pastrnak and Jeremy Swayman, Vancouver Canucks captain Quinn Hughes, Vegas Golden Knights forward Jack Eichel, Nashville Predators forward Filip Forsberg, and Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog, among others.\n\nThe NHL says the crews working on the docuseries will continue to follow McDavid and Tkachuk, capturing their interactions with their teammates and families during the Stanley Cup final that start this Saturday in Florida.\n\nThe series is produced jointly by Box To Box Films and NHL Films. Box To Box Films also produced popular docuseries like \"Drive to Survive\" (Formula 1), \"Break Point\" (tennis), and \"Full Swing\" (golf).\n\n\"We want to stay true to the world of ice hockey with the series,\" said Box To Box Films co-founder and executive producer Paul Martin in a statement announcing the docuseries Thursday.\n\n\"The sport is as beautiful, skilful and graceful, as it is brutal, pressurized and powerful; and we aim to balance the energetic and fast-paced action leading up to the Stanley Cup final, with the quiet and raw drama taking place off the ice.\"\n\nAdded Shaun Alperin, head of content at Amazon Prime: \"We cannot wait to bring to the screen the passion, the intensity, and the sheer excitement of the road to the Stanley Cup final, revealing what fans have only speculated goes on behind the scenes of the world's fastest team sport.\"\n\nAmazon Prime boasts of millions of subscribers from over 240 countries and territories across the world, driving the NHL's desire to grow the game by reaching a wider audience.\n\nThis new docuseries is the fourth such NHL project with Amazon Prime, following the 2021 series \"All or Nothing: Toronto Maple Leafs\" as well as two projects this season: \"Chosen One: Alexandre Daigle\" and \"Saving Sakic.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I think everybody has seen the effects that 'Drive to Survive' had on Formula 1 racing, 'Full Swing' has done a lot for golf, and obviously the storytelling that's involved is unique and very different.\"\n\nIt's another step in the league's evolutionary process showing more player personalities in a game that has forever been defined by teams and not individuals. The series features two players in the Stanley Cup Final -- Edmonton's Connor McDavid and Florida's Matthew Tkachuk -- along with the likes of Boston's David Pastrnak, Vegas's Jack Eichel, Nashville's Filip Forsberg, Toronto's William Nylander, Colorado's Gabriel Landeskog and the New York Rangers' Jacob Trouba.\n\nMayer said, with help from agents like Pat Brisson and Judd Moldaver and the NHLPA, there was far more acceptance of the project from players than those of previous generations.\n\n\"That's one of the things we've seen in this moment of time: Our players are much more willing, much more open and I feel like, 'Wow, we got the buy in,'\" Mayer said. \"(Having) watched 'Drive to Survive' (and) 'Full Swing,' our players actually said, 'Let's go' and they've been great.\"\n\nBox to Box co-founder and executive producer Paul Martin had never been to a hockey game until last year, knowing only Wayne Gretzky \"and they fight a lot\" about the sport. His interest was piqued attending regular-season and playoff Los Angeles Kings games, then the Golden Knights' Cup clincher on the Las Vegas strip last June.\n\nThis is the company's first foray into hockey after earlier this year starting the process of a series documenting the 2024 Major League Soccer season, which will air on Apple TV.\n\n\"It just felt like a really great time for us with no real affiliations to kind of hockey or at that point any real understanding of hockey to kind of just come in see what kind of stories we could tell,\" Martin said. \"It felt like certainly the right time for us but also maybe the right time for hockey with this new generation of players and new generation of clubs that exist now in the league.\"\n\nAcknowledging Formula 1 several years ago was in a place that it needed a spark of sorts that the docuseries provided, Martin said he's not sure if this will transform the NHL or if it even needs transforming. But this has also been a bit of a different process making a show in a sport in which team-first has been engrained forever.\n\nThat has led producers and camera operators to think a little differently in crowded locker rooms and other situations.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it's a huge sea change,\" Martin said. \"Our type of storytelling hinges on individuals being able to drive those kind of narratives, so within the team environment you're focused on individuals within that team, but you have to be super respectful that it is a team sport.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

And one of the great things about walking in blind to a new sport is a blissful obliviousness of any third-rail topics. So, Martin casually asked Nylander -- out of genuine curiosity, not as a stress test of sorts -- when was the last time the Toronto Maple Leafs had won the Stanley Cup.\n\nJust like that, Martin knew he had one of his main stars. Or, as he refers to the professional athletes in his shows, \"characters.\" And yes, contrary to conventional wisdom, it turns out hockey has some characters.\n\nIt's one of the first thing Martin hears when someone asks him about the new (as-yet untitled) six-episode NHL-centric series that will debut on Amazon's Prime Video in October: Hockey players are boring. Hockey players go out of their way to stand out as little as possible. Auto racing, tennis and golf are individual sports; hockey's a team sport. You'll never get individual players, particularly superstars, to truly buy in on anything that elevates them above their teams.\n\nBut to hear Martin tell it, it really wasn't that difficult at all.\n\n\"We heard that a lot,\" he said. \"Whether we were just fortunate or whether our processes bring it out of them once we dug in, I never really saw it as an issue. The younger generation is coming through. It's just society in general. They're so used to sharing a lot of their lives and their story on Instagram or whatever it is.\"\n\nNHL chief content officer Steve Mayer said that Amazon zeroed in on approximately 20 players, starting after the All-Star break. That includes Connor McDavid, Matthew Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Sidney Crosby, Leon Draisaitl and Connor Bedard. That McDavid, Draisaitl and Tkachuk are all in the Stanley Cup Final is serendipity for the Box To Box crew, which knew that plenty of storylines to which they had devoted a lot of time and filming would get left on the cutting-room floor because of early playoff departures. The filming process is essentially a guessing game as to which players will be both entertaining and around long enough to devote swaths of an episode to.\n\nThe arduous process of cutting months of footage down to six episodes -- the quick turnaround between the end of the Final and the start of the season made eight or 10 episodes somewhat unfeasible -- has barely begun, but for those inclined to read the tea leaves, here are the players singled out in the official press release touting the show: McDavid, Tkachuk, Draisaitl, Jacob Trouba, David Pastrnak, Jeremy Swayman, Quinn Hughes, Jack Eichel, Nylander, Filip Forsberg and Gabriel Landeskog, who has spent the past two seasons trying to work his way back from a major knee injury.\n\nMarketing its stars has never been the NHL's strong suit, and Mayer was quick to point out that the Stanley Cup is still the league's biggest star and the focal point of its promotional material. But the Amazon show is part of a larger effort to elevate more NHL stars to household-name status. It's a Box to Box production distributed by Amazon, so the NHL's stake in the show isn't financial; it's entirely promotional.\n\n\"Two years ago, our promos would be 'Tampa Bay vs. Colorado tonight,'\" Mayer said. \"Now, it's 'Connor McDavid against Matthew Tkachuk, Oilers-Panthers for the Cup.' You see it in all sports, and we're realizing that the stars bring the audience.\"\n\nSo you can expect to see footage of Trouba painting at home, of McDavid at a dinner party in Edmonton, of Brady Tkachuk supporting his brother in the playoffs, of life at home with players' partners and families. The hope is not simply to give die-hard hockey fans a closer look at the sport they love, but to hook casual sports fans into the world of the NHL, the way \"Drive To Survive\" did with F1, which has experienced a massive boom in popularity in the United States since the show debuted in March of 2019.\n\nAnd it's not always the biggest stars who get the most screen time. \"Drive to Survive\" fans know to expect about two out of 10 episodes every season to focus on the big smile and big personality of Daniel Ricciardo, an eight-time race winner who's now a back-of-the-pack also-ran. And, for years, the cellar-dwelling Haas racing team would get a spotlight episode or two because of its charismatic (and profane) team leader, Guenther Steiner. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen, one of the most dominant athletes in all of global sports, is typically an afterthought on the show.\n\nIn the end, personality and drama win out. And it sounds like Nylander and Pastrnak -- two world-class players, mind you -- might be the biggest breakout stars of the show.\n\n\"Pastrnak is one of the funniest players I've ever sat in a room with,\" Martin said. \"But you want to find that mix. When we look at these types of shows, you don't want all the superstars, but equally, you don't want all the journeymen. You want that right mix. You want to look at things from slightly different perspectives.\"\n\nMayer first brought Martin to a Los Angeles Kings game late last season, then brought him to the Stanley Cup Final clincher in Las Vegas, bringing him onto the ice and into the winning locker room afterward. The Kings game was Martin's first, and he told Mayer that all he knew about the sport was \"Wayne Gretzky and that they fight.\" Mayer politely told him that they don't really fight all that much anymore.\n\n\"Thirty seconds into the game, two guys start to fight,\" Martin said with a laugh. \"Growing up with no background in hockey, never really watching a lot of hockey in my life, all I knew was that the Stanley Cup was so identifiable and that hockey is mad Canadians that fight. But I knew there had to be more to it than that, if we can just get on the inside. And that's what excited me about this. Maybe you find characters that you or the league take for granted, but I'm in this luxurious position where it's all new to me and everyone's interesting. I'm a kid in a candy shop.\"\n\nThis isn't the NHL's first foray into behind-the-scenes documentary-style programming. There was HBO's \"24/7: Road to the Winter Classic,\" which eventually morphed into a much more PG-rated basic-cable version. Amazon produced \"All Or Nothing,\" a series about the 2020-21 Maple Leafs season, and two more traditional documentaries: \"Saving Sakic\" and \"Chosen One: Alexandre Daigle.\"\n\nAnd yes, the Box To Box crew got tossed out of a locker room by a fuming coach once or twice. Hey, it's tradition.\n\n\"We've probably been kicked out of a dressing room on every show we've ever done,\" Martin said with a laugh. \"It's just part of sports access -- you're suddenly in rooms where it absolutely goes off. It's par for the course. Hockey is seen as a very macho world, very alpha kind of world. Hopefully we get to do this for more seasons after this, so we're probably expecting more of that.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

I think everybody has seen the effects that 'Drive to Survive' had on Formula 1 racing, 'Full Swing' has done a lot for golf, and obviously the storytelling that's involved is unique and very different.\"\n\nIt's another step in the league's evolutionary process showing more player personalities in a game that has forever been defined by teams and not individuals. The series features two players in the Stanley Cup Final -- Edmonton's Connor McDavid and Florida's Matthew Tkachuk -- along with the likes of Boston's David Pastrnak, Vegas's Jack Eichel, Nashville's Filip Forsberg, Toronto's William Nylander, Colorado's Gabriel Landeskog and the New York Rangers' Jacob Trouba.\n\nMayer said, with help from agents like Pat Brisson and Judd Moldaver and the NHLPA, there was far more acceptance of the project from players than those of previous generations.\n\n\"That's one of the things we've seen in this moment of time: Our players are much more willing, much more open and I feel like, 'Wow, we got the buy in,'\" Mayer said. \"(Having) watched 'Drive to Survive' (and) 'Full Swing,' our players actually said, 'Let's go' and they've been great.\"\n\nBox to Box co-founder and executive producer Paul Martin had never been to a hockey game until last year, knowing only Wayne Gretzky \"and they fight a lot\" about the sport. His interest was piqued attending regular-season and playoff Los Angeles Kings games, then the Golden Knights' Cup clincher on the Las Vegas strip last June.\n\nThis is the company's first foray into hockey after earlier this year starting the process of a series documenting the 2024 Major League Soccer season, which will air on Apple TV.\n\n\"It just felt like a really great time for us with no real affiliations to kind of hockey or at that point any real understanding of hockey to kind of just come in see what kind of stories we could tell,\" Martin said. \"It felt like certainly the right time for us but also maybe the right time for hockey with this new generation of players and new generation of clubs that exist now in the league.\"\n\nAcknowledging Formula 1 several years ago was in a place that it needed a spark of sorts that the docuseries provided, Martin said he's not sure if this will transform the NHL or if it even needs transforming. But this has also been a bit of a different process making a show in a sport in which team-first has been engrained forever.\n\nThat has led producers and camera operators to think a little differently in crowded locker rooms and other situations.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it's a huge sea change,\" Martin said. \"Our type of storytelling hinges on individuals being able to drive those kind of narratives, so within the team environment you're focused on individuals within that team, but you have to be super respectful that it is a team sport.\"\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

Connor McDavid, Matthew Tkachuk, Quinn Hughes, and Leon Draisaitl will be featured in a new NHL docuseries on Prime Video.\n\nThe NHL and Prime Video officially announced on Thursday that they will be releasing a docuseries in the fall that will give fans a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of some of the league's biggest stars.\n\nIt's been known for some time that this series was coming and that Vancouver Canucks captain Quinn Hughes would be a part of it. A camera crew from Amazon started following Hughes near the end of the regular season and was frequently seen throughout the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nThe official announcement confirms Hughes' involvement, along with ten other players: Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl from the Edmonton Oilers, Matthew Tkachuk from the Florida Panthers, Jacob Trouba from the New York Rangers, David Pastrnak and Jeremy Swayman from the Boston Bruins, Jack Eichel from the Vegas Golden Knights, William Nylander from the Toronto Maple Leafs, Filip Forsberg from the Nashville Predators, and Gabriel Landeskog from the Colorado Avalanche, though other players will also be featured.\n\nThe series is being co-produced by NHL Productions and Box To Box Films, a documentary film company that has produced several sports documentary series, including the popular Netflix series \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\" The series will be exclusively available on Prime Video.\n\n\"We want to stay true to the world of ice hockey with the series,\" said Paul Martin of Box To Box Films. \"The sport is as beautiful, skillful, and graceful, as it is brutal, pressurized and powerful; and we aim to balance the energetic and fast-paced action leading up to the Stanley Cup Final, with the quiet and raw drama taking place off the ice.\"\n\nThe series should be an excellent opportunity for Canucks fans to get a closer look at the often quiet and reserved Hughes, though it remains to be seen how much of the series will be focused on Hughes. The Canucks had plenty of moments in their playoff run that felt like a Hollywood sports movie, so it's easy to imagine those moments playing out dramatically on the screen with swells of music behind them.\n\nThe trailer for the show, however, is mostly focused on the Leafs' Nylander. Two of the only shots of Hughes in the trailer are alongside Leafs captain Auston Matthews at the All-Star Game.\n\nThe film crew spent plenty of time with Hughes, including a trip to Granville Island on one of the Canucks' days off. They regularly hovered around media scrums before and after games and spoke to Hughes' teammates. Presumably, there should be plenty of Canucks content for them to pull from.\n\nHow could the series not feature some of the Canucks' incredible comebacks in these playoffs, such as Brock Boeser's last-minute hat trick in Game 4 against the Predators?\n\nDetails of the series are scant, however. It does not even have a title yet, though some of the slates shown on screen suggest it could be called \"Forecheck.\"\n\nHow many episodes will there be? How much access were they really given? How much attention will be paid to the Canucks given the series will be following McDavid, Tkachuk, and their respective teams in their pursuit of the Stanley Cup?\n\nWe'll just have to wait and see.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Original hockey documentaries Chosen One: Alexandre Daigle and Saving Sakic premiered this season on Prime Video.\n\nThe series follows a two-year deal between Amazon, Rogers Communications and the NHL under which Prime Video Canada became the exclusive home of Monday Night Hockey in Canada for the 2024-25 season.", "source": {"uri": "playbackonline.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Playback"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(sports_docuseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All or Nothing (sports docuseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Daigle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandre Daigle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Communications"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.playbackonline.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Amazon_Canada_Prime_Video_Brings_the_Intensity_and_Action_of_Lif-525x350.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630099", "eventUri": "eng-9630099", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

A camera crew from Amazon started following Hughes near the end of the regular season and was frequently seen throughout the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nThe official announcement confirms Hughes' involvement, along with ten other players: Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl from the Edmonton Oilers, Matthew Tkachuk from the Florida Panthers, Jacob Trouba from the New York Rangers, David Pastrnak and Jeremy Swayman from the Boston Bruins, Jack Eichel from the Vegas Golden Knights, William Nylander from the Toronto Maple Leafs, Filip Forsberg from the Nashville Predators, and Gabriel Landeskog from the Colorado Avalanche, though other players will also be featured.\n\nThe series is being co-produced by NHL Productions and Box To Box Films, a documentary film company that has produced several sports documentary series, including the popular Netflix series \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\" The series will be exclusively available on Prime Video.\n\n\"We want to stay true to the world of ice hockey with the series,\" said Paul Martin of Box To Box Films. \"The sport is as beautiful, skillful, and graceful, as it is brutal, pressurized and powerful; and we aim to balance the energetic and fast-paced action leading up to the Stanley Cup Final, with the quiet and raw drama taking place off the ice.\"\n\nThe series should be an excellent opportunity for Canucks fans to get a closer look at the often quiet and reserved Hughes, though it remains to be seen how much of the series will be focused on Hughes. The Canucks had plenty of moments in their playoff run that felt like a Hollywood sports movie, so it's easy to imagine those moments playing out dramatically on the screen with swells of music behind them.\n\nThe trailer for the show, however, is mostly focused on the Leafs' Nylander. Two of the only shots of Hughes in the trailer are alongside Leafs captain Auston Matthews at the All-Star Game.\n\nThe film crew spent plenty of time with Hughes, including a trip to Granville Island on one of the Canucks' days off. They regularly hovered around media scrums before and after games and spoke to Hughes' teammates. Presumably, there should be plenty of Canucks content for them to pull from.\n\nHow could the series not feature some of the Canucks' incredible comebacks in these playoffs, such as Brock Boeser's last-minute hat trick in Game 4 against the Predators?\n\nDetails of the series are scant, however. It does not even have a title yet, though some of the slates shown on screen suggest it could be called \"Forecheck.\"\n\nHow many episodes will there be? How much access were they really given? How much attention will be paid to the Canucks given the series will be following McDavid, Tkachuk, and their respective teams in their pursuit of the Stanley Cup?\n\nWe'll just have to wait and see.", "source": {"uri": "tricitynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tri-City News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Hughes", "type": "person", "score":

Cast Of NHL Superstars", "body": "Over the past few years, Drive to Survive and Full Swing have respectively offered viewers an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at the trials and tribulations that F1 drivers and professional golfers have to grapple with.\n\nNow, the team behind those series is turning its attention to the NHL, and it looks like we're in for a treat based on the first trailer and the list of notable hockey names that will be at the center of the upcoming docuseries.\n\nThe NHL has historically struggled to market its product to the masses for a variety of reasons (it's hard to underestimate the impact of its disastrous television deal with NBC that came to a merciful end in 2022), and the fact that most hockey players are conditioned to conduct robotic interviews where their true personalities are rarely on display certainly doesn't help the cause.\n\nAs a result, it was pretty hard not to be intrigued when a report surfaced earlier this year concerning a deal the NHL struck with Amazon to film a documentary series centered around approximately a dozen \"star players\" whose identities remained a mystery when the news surfaced back in March.\n\nNow, we've got our first look at the still-untitled project made in conjunction with the production company behind Netflix's Drive to Survive and Full Swing, which confirms some of the biggest names in the sport were followed around by camera crews over the course of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the series will boast a star-studded list of central figures including Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl of the Oilers, David Pastrnak and Jeremy Swayman of the Bruins, Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk, Golden Knights center Jack Eichel, Rangers captain Jacob Trouba, and Maple Leafs winger William Nylander (among others).\n\nAs you can see from the trailer, the camera crews were following teams during the playoffs, and they'll be embedded with both the Oilers and the Panthers as they gear up for the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nIt's unclear exactly when the series will air when it debuts in the fall, but it looks like we're in for a treat.", "source": {"uri":

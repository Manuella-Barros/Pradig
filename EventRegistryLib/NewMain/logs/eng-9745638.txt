Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nConservationists and grizzly bear experts, including the researcher hired by the province to write grizzly bear status reports in 2010 and 2022, dispute this. Marco Festa-Bianchet, calls the minister's data vague and sees the new management tactic as a \"backdoor way to reopen hunting the species.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This notion that there are 20 bears euthanized per year - that's like 10 times more than what's actually happening,\" said Festa-Bianchet, Universt\u00e9 de Sherbrooke biologist, who has 40 years of experience working in large mammal ecology and conservation.\n\n\"Is he mixing in black bears. Is he making that up? I have no idea where that number comes from because it's certainly not the information I had when I wrote the status reports.\"\n\nThe most recent status report shows lethal removal of problem grizzly bears by agency control accounted for 25 bears destroyed over 2009-2018, averaging about 2.5 euthanizations annually. The data was pulled from the province's open government portal.\n\nAnother report on grizzly bear mortality by Alberta Environment and Parks in 2020 shows there were 12 total euthanizations from 2009-2020 in bear management areas 4, 5, and 6, which includes Canmore, Kananaskis Country and surrounding areas. There are seven bear management areas across the province as outlined in the provincial grizzly bear recovery plan.\n\n\"The Government of Alberta essentially stopped producing that information. ... There's nothing there that's publicly available for the last four or five years,\" said Festa-Bianchet. \"So, who knows where this new number is coming from.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFesta-Bianchet further noted that despite producing the latest grizzly bear status report in 2022, the document has not been made publicly available online, unlike the 2010 report. He recently discovered it has yet to undergo approval and has not been told the reason why.\n\nSince 2006, hunting grizzly bears has been outlawed by the provincial government. In 2010, the species was designated as threatened by criteria under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which states a population of less than 1,000 sexually mature bears is considered threatened. At that time, there were an estimated 700-800 grizzly bears in Alberta.\n\nThe most recent province-wide census of grizzlies showed a total population of between 856 and 973 in 2021.\n\nForestry and Parks claims that as the species' population has slowly grown, so too has the number and severity of negative human-grizzly bear interactions.\n\nIn mid-June, the province amended regulations under the Wildlife Act, allowing what it's calling a network of public wildlife management responders to track and kill grizzly bears - not accompanied by a cub - that are involved in a human-bear conflict or an area of concern with authorization from provincial wildlife officers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis could include a bruin that has injured or killed a human or that poses a risk to life, livestock or property.\n\nLoewen said not every situation that fits this description will be deemed appropriate to be dealt with by a member of the public.\n\n\"For instance, if it's a dangerous situation and there's a dangerous bear, and the bear's visible, then we would expect the responding wildlife officer to take care of the problem animal at that point,\" he said.\n\n\"But quite often, what happens if, say a grizzly bear comes in and kills, let's say, 20 sheep in a sheep yard, that bear isn't just standing there waiting for an officer to show up. At that point, the officer would have to go out and try to search and pursue and find this bear to deal with the problem.\"\n\nThis could be an instance where a member of the public selected from a shortlist of eligible applicants is called to respond to what the province says can be a \"time-consuming and resource-intensive affair\" for provincial wildlife staff. Only adult residents of Alberta with a recreational licence to hunt under Section 29 of the Wildlife Act can apply to be selected from the wildlife management responder network.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLoewen insists the same parameters required of provincial wildlife officers would apply to selected members of the public. He said there's no reason to suggest those Albertans that \"[have] the experience of being in the outdoors and shooting big game, [are] any less qualified to deal with this issue than an officer.\"\n\nThose members of the public would be told when, where and what identified grizzly bear to kill, and with what equipment is allowed.\n\nThe minister further insisted this is not a hunt, though, the ministerial order outlining the change in the Wildlife Act specifically states, \"despite its status as a threatened animal, the hunting of Ursus arctos (Brown (Grizzly) Bear) is permitted under Section 53.1.\"\n\nFesta-Bianchet argued if the identified bruin becomes the property of the member of the public selected to shoot it, it is a hunt.\n\n\"It's a hunt that is disguised as defending Alberta families against these 'mean' bears,\" he said.\n\nSince 2005, Forestry and Parks says there have been eight people killed by grizzly bears and 62 grizzly bear maulings, in addition to 897 livestock losses since 2016.\n\nLoewen cited the killing of a Lethbridge couple and their dog by a grizzly bear in the backcountry of Banff National Park in September 2023 as a recent example of predatory behaviour by the species, which the ministry claims are on the rise.\n\nA post-mortem examination of the 25-year-old bear by Parks Canada found it was a non-lactating female, meaning there were no cubs around that she would have been protecting to prompt an attack.\n\nGrizzly bear expert Bruce McLellan, who is also former president of the International Association for Bear Research and Management and co-chair of the IUCN Bear Specialist Group was interviewed by the Outlook at the time. He said the incident did not sound like a surprise encounter but that it also does not mean it was predatory.\n\n\"She lived 25 years without attacking anybody, and she's probably had lots of opportunity, so something changed,\" he said, noting there is a chance the couples' dog could have agitated the bear.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLoewen said the information he has received is that the last four human deaths by grizzly bears in Alberta were \"predatory in nature.\"\n\nHe said changes to the Wildlife Act were made in response to years of complaints from rural municipalities and residents concerned about wildlife damage and safety issues with grizzly bears, in particular.\n\nBanff-Kananaskis MLA and the NDP's environment and tourism critic Sarah Elmeligi criticized the minister for proceeding with the amendment without formal consultation with stakeholders or private landowners.\n\n\"I can appreciate that he's had conversations with folks at meetings and community events where they've expressed concern about grizzly bears on their land or potential conflict situations - I'm sure they have.\n\n\"But that's not the same thing as consultation ... Consultation is a process where you're actually gathering data and you can say 'this many people said this.' That is not what has happened here.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA bear biologist, Elmeligi acknowledged that grizzly bears can be dangerous but said she believes the minister is misrepresenting the reality of how the species interacts on the landscape.\n\n\"He's fear-mongering Albertans and painting this picture that there's also these bloodthirsty grizzly bears running around the landscape, killing people and eating things, and that is, frankly, just not the case.\n\n\"What we know from the grizzly bear recovery plan and the data from the updated grizzly bear status report that came out in 2022, is that there are two to three grizzly bears per year that are euthanized because of extreme human-bear conflict.\"\n\nThe grizzly bear recovery plan, updated in 2020, notes that since the plan was adopted in 2008 there has been an increase in human-grizzly bear conflict on private property adjacent to public land. In large part, because of increasing human encroachment on bear habitat.\n\nBut there is no data to support that killing bears will reduce human conflict, Elmeligi said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We do know and appreciate that addressing human-bear conflict is really important and that coexistence takes work. But what we also know, and what the science really clearly shows, is that killing bears that engage in conflict does not reduce conflict risk.\"\n\nInstead, implementing non-lethal bear management strategies like aversive conditioning, supporting ranchers and farmers by building electric fencing to protect their livelihood and reducing wildlife attractants, can and has worked in the past.\n\nIn the Bow Valley, attractant management activities have progressed from securing garbage, to passing bylaws banning bird feeders and fruit trees, and to the removal of natural bear forage such as buffaloberry occurring at the edges of communities.\n\n\"These targeted programs decreased conflict incidents specific to these attractants,\" states the grizzly bear recovery plan. \"As grizzly bear occurrence increases in other parts of their range, it is anticipated that other communities will experience similar conflict patterns, and can benefit from the lessons learned in the Bow Valley.\"\n\nThe recovery plan further recommended employing human-wildlife conflict specialists across all seven of its bear management areas. The last person in that position retired in 2022, however, and currently there are none.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There's a whole suite of recommendations in that plan that have not been implemented,\" said Elmeligi.\n\n\"In my opinion, as a bear biologist and also just as a person who appreciates Alberta wildlife, until we have exhausted all of the recommendations in the grizzly bear recovery plan, I don't think we should be looking at providing the public with opportunities to kill bears.\"\n\nElmeligi also acknowledged there are some gaps in the recovery plan. Namely, how it quantifies recovery of the species in Alberta.\n\n\"That's one of the continual criticisms of the provincial grizzly bear recovery plan is that recovery isn't really defined as a population number. It should be defined for each bear management area,\" she said.\n\n\"That is a big part of this. The idea of having a listing of threatened animals or endangered animals is that you then work to recover those populations so that eventually you can take them off that list. That's the whole principle behind all this, but we don't really have a very good definition of what would be required to remove grizzly bears from the list of threatened species in Alberta.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe latest publicly available population census data estimated there were between 856 and 973 grizzly bears in the province in 2021. The IUCN defines an animal as threatened if there are less than 1,000 breeding individuals in a population.\n\nIn a recent press release, the province claims grizzly bear numbers have increased from about 800 to more than 1,150.\n\nLoewen, who said that number was provided to him by Alberta Environment and Protected Areas wildlife officials, suggested it was a conservative estimate.\n\n\"I know there's probably many people that would disagree and suggest there is more. But those are the numbers provided by the wildlife professionals,\" he said.\n\nWhether that figure is accurate, by biologist and conservationist expertise, the number of mature bears would still not be enough to remove it as a threatened species as defined by the IUCN.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLoewen noted that although the ban to hunt grizzly bears remains in place, there is no legislation in Alberta that states a threatened species cannot be hunted.\n\n\"The classic example of that is bison, which is also classified as threatened. And we do have a hunting season for bison. But again, the grizzly bear does not have a hunting season. This isn't even a hunt. It's, again, the residents of Alberta being able to help with the job that Fish and Wildlife officers do.\"\n\nElmeligi and Festa-Bianchet highlighted concerns about a lack of clarity in the process, suggesting it could lead to errors and delay effective management actions that could be better handled by trained wildlife officers.\n\nThey expressed concern for how a member of the public might determine which grizzly bear is the right one that's been authorized to be killed.\n\n\"How do you know it's the right bear,\" Festa-Bianchet questioned. \"Fish and Wildlife and conservation officers are trained to identify the bear, to realize when there is a problem and if there are alternatives.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLoewen said once a grizzly is killed, it will have to be brought to wildlife officials to be looked over to determine it was the identified bear. He said a necropsy will look at its age and any other factors that may determine what led to it \"becoming a problem.\"\n\nThe province says in addition to the new public network of wildlife management responders, it will continue to fund educational initiatives like community BearSmart and WildSmart programs and the Waterton Biosphere - Carnivores and Communities program, which offers Albertans in the agriculture industry methods of preventing conflicts and losses due to carnivores, such as disposing of livestock carcasses in bear-proof bins. There was no indication that funding for these initiatives would be increasing, however.\n\nIt also said it would be working to restore important habitat for a range of species through methods like prescribed burns to create clearings and encourage new vegetation growth for wildlife food sources, and cited recent improvements to parks and campgrounds in Kananaskis, with other projects underway.\n\n\"When it comes to habitat enhancement, we've done prescribed burns and mechanical clearing. For instance, in the Spray Lakes West Campground, we've done mechanical clearing and made the campground smaller, so it wasn't spread out so much,\" said Loewen.\n\n\"We've also done some mechanical clearing beyond the campground to create some habitat for bears to go to feed so as to create less disruption to campers and less dangerous situations there.\"\n\nLoewen said he anticipates applications will open for the wildlife management responder network this month and will become active once first authorization is made by a provincial wildlife officer. The fee to apply is $50 and he said funds raised would be used toward conservation efforts.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

These changes demonstrate our commitment to ensuring Albertans can safely work and recreate throughout the province.\"\n\nGrizzly bear hunting was banned in Alberta since 2006. At that time, the entire population was approximately 700 individuals. The province's statement indicates that there are now more than 1,150 grizzlies.\n\nThat figure is much higher than what was reported in the province'sAddendum to the Alberta Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan, published in February 2021. Figures tabulated in that document speculate that the total population is somewhere between 856 and 973 individuals.\n\nGrizzly bears are still considered a species at risk within Alberta and have been formally designated as a Threatened species in 2010 under Alberta's Wildlife Act.\n\nThe Ministerial Order dictating the changes to the Wildlife Act indicate that hunting a grizzly bear is authorized if it is not accompanied by a cub and if a wildlife officer has determined that the grizzly is either involved in a human-wildlife conflict situation or is in an area of concern.\n\nHunting any animal is still prohibited in all national parks, including Jasper National Park.\n\n\"The Alberta government's news release [on July 9] states that 'This is not a bear hunt,' but the Ministerial Order tells a different story,\" said Devon Earl, conservation specialist with the Alberta Wildlife Association (AWA), in an email to the Fitzhugh.\n\nThe AWA's newsletter expresses concern that the Wildlife Regulation was altered without public consultation or legislative review by Minister Loewen. It was simply published in the Alberta Gazette on a Friday.\n\nIt also expresses the environmental conservation organization's dismay that the Ministerial Order doesn't clearly define what \"areas of concern\" means.\n\n\"We fear that the term could apply to anywhere bears and people overlap,\" said Earl.\n\nSarah Elmeligi, Alberta NDP critic for environment, sports and tourism, questioned the notion that killing grizzly bears reduces instances of human-bear conflict.\n\n\"It does not solve the problem. We know from scientific research that the best way to reduce conflict is to work with people to better co-exist with grizzly bears,\" said Elmeligi, who has been a bear biologist for nearly two decades, in a media release.\n\n\"Human use management on the landscape like the livestock compensation program, subsidies for electric fencing, attractant management on public and private land, and better education, are the things that actually reduce conflict. These programs should be amplified across the province to reduce conflict at its source,\" she continued.\n\nFurther to that, she referred to the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan, published in July 2020, that shows that only 10 grizzly bears were euthanized for management action between 2010 and 2015.\n\n\"The Minister is scaring Albertans into believing that grizzly attacks are commonplace and that the only way to solve the problem is to kill bears.

No, in the double-speak we have become accustomed to it is \"protection of life and property from problem wildlife.\"\n\nAccording to Todd Loewen, the government is \"taking a proactive approach to help Albertans co-exist with wildlife\" by shooting some of them.\n\nJust the bad grizzlies and elk, not the good ones.\n\nThey are doing this by providing \"rapid conflict response times.\" You might think this will be accomplished by the deployment of trained, competent Fish and Wildlife officers. No, the minister will draw the name of some trigger happy hunter out of a hat and they will rush out to protect a Threatened species like a grizzly by shooting it. What could go wrong with this novel approach?\n\nGiven the hype of unrelenting danger promoted in the press announcement, you might think it unsafe to go out into the woods today, for fear of encountering a rogue bear or a belligerent elk. Fear is a powerful motivator, except when the facts don't support the contention and you propose something incredibly silly instead of thinking about rational ways to co-exist with wildlife. Adults in the room, like the Waterton Biosphere Reserve's Carnivores and Communities Program and local Bear Smart groups are showing the way.\n\nYes, bears can be dangerous. But so, too is failing to monitor and control greenhouse gas emissions, allowing unsustainable levels of logging in our headwaters, not adequately monitoring our essential water supplies and considering more coal mining with certain releases of selenium.\n\nStatistically you are far more likely to be injured or killed on your drive to grizzly habitat than ever seeing a grizzly or being attacked by one.\n\nNeither the minister nor the Alberta government have suggested any rapid response for any of these other risks.\n\nSince the closure of a hunting season for grizzly bears in 2006 there has been a small, but vocal group of trophy hunters agitating for opportunities to shoot a bear. The minister seems to support this, without input from conservation groups or from experts in grizzly bear management. This has become one of those backward initiatives of, \"The answer is a grizzly hunt, what was the question?\"\n\nBefore this hunt was made public the minister's office was soliciting input from selected people to provide letters of concern about bear (and presumably elk) conflicts. How do you spell \"disingenuous?\"\n\nIf the Alberta government were serious about wildlife coexistence (and they should be) there needs be a deep dive into why there are conflicts. With our rapidly expanding and unsustainable land use footprint in the Eastern Slopes grizzlies are running out of room, out of quiet space and of connectivity to essential habitats. Every one of the 19 recent cumulative effects assessments done in the Eastern Slopes says so, including ones provided by the government of Alberta. As a result a few bears (very few) run afoul of us and lethal actions undertaken by wildlife professionals might be required.\n\nA serious initiative of limiting the scope and scale of logging, of off-highway vehicle activity, of random camping, of proposed coal mining and of reclaiming the hundreds of kilometres of roads and trails that bisect grizzly habitat would be a rational step to giving wildlife secure habitat.

Recent conflicts between grizzly bears and humans have been predatory in nature and have not been related to the protection of cubs or food sources. Additionally, agricultural losses due to elk foraging on crops are increasing across the province, and this problem requires additional tools to manage growing elk herds in Alberta.\n\nTo protect Alberta families and communities, visitors, and agricultural producers, Alberta's government is taking action on problem grizzlies responsible for the increasing number of negative interactions.\n\nAlberta's government is announcing a multi-pronged approach to solving the issue of problem and dangerous wildlife by offering a range of management tools to address challenges and keep Albertans safe.\n\nAlberta's government is creating a new network of wildlife management responders to help stop dangerous and deadly grizzly bear attacks on people and livestock. When a problem animal like a grizzly or elk is identified, members of the approved network will help provide rapid conflict response times across all regions of Alberta. This response could include tracking and euthanizing a problem animal, while still following all rules and regulations already in place. This is not a bear hunt; this is a measure to ensure the safety of humans and livestock.\n\n\"The loss of even one human life because of a grizzly bear attack is one too many. We are taking a proactive approach to help Albertans co-exist with wildlife through our new wildlife management program. These changes demonstrate our commitment to ensuring Albertans can safely work and recreate throughout the province.\"\n\nTodd Loewen, Minister, Forestry and Parks\n\n\"Losses suffered due to predation can be a significant blow to ranchers and farmers. This new program will reduce the number of losses, protect farms, and help producers avoid conflicts with wildlife.\"\n\nRJ Sigurdson, Minister, Agriculture and Irrigation\n\nIn addition to the network of wildlife management responders, Alberta's government continues to fund educational initiatives to prevent human-wildlife conflict. The Community Bear Smart Grant Program has received $100,000 in funding to help community organizations educate Albertans about bear safety.\n\nOther initiatives include the Waterton Biosphere - Carnivores and Communities program, which offers ranchers and rural Albertans methods of preventing conflicts and losses due to carnivores. Programs like the Wildlife Aversion Program have also been successful in conditioning wildlife populations to avoid areas commonly used by people.\n\nThe WildSmart Community Program leads diverse education and outreach efforts in the Bow Valley to raise public awareness and empower citizens to coexist safely with wildlife. The Bow Valley is home more than 25,000 people and is a major corridor for grizzly bears, black bears, cougars, wolves, elk, coyotes and other large mammals.\n\nAnother way to limit negative human-grizzly interactions is to restore important habitat for a range of species, providing the space and food they need. Last year, extensive habitat enhancement work took place as part of improvements in Kananaskis parks and campgrounds, with additional projects underway.\n\nAlbertans interested in joining the network of wildlife management responders are invited to apply through the AlbertaRELM online licensing and draw applications system. Those who have been selected to participate in the program will be contacted to complete the application process. Approved problem wildlife responders will be directed to track and respond to grizzlies and other problem wildlife. This action will occur after a problem animal has been reported to wildlife enforcement officers and determined to be a risk to life, livestock or property.\n\n\"Due to the increasing number of grizzly bears and the expansion of their territories, there is a heightened safety issue for rural Alberta residents. I am pleased to see this new program from the Alberta government, our wildlife officers will now be able to respond to other important issues.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.farms.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.farms.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foraging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grizzly bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Loewen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Loewen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bow Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carnivore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irrigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterton_Lakes_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterton Lakes National Park"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterton Lakes National Park"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kananaskis_Country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kananaskis Country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\u2013wildlife_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human\u2013wildlife conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_black_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American black bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cougar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coyote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "wgt": 23}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745638", "eventUri": "eng-9745638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

There is no clear plan for future surveys. Further, an updated grizzly bear status report is complete, but has not yet been publicly released. Albertans deserve transparency on wildlife data and management.\n\nIf the provincial government is interested in re-opening the hunt, they should bring that question forward for an open discussion and analysis. Instead, the government quietly changed the Wildlife Act without any public consultation. With any hunt, there are two primary questions: Should we hunt this species? And, is a harvest biologically sustainable? For success, the answers to these questions must match.\n\nAs for whether we \"should\" hunt grizzly bears, that is a question for Albertans. Views on this vary widely and everyone should have the opportunity to express their opinions. The latter should be answered using the best available data.

Some of them were just typical relocations, while others were being moved into different areas for Montana's Augmentation Program, which they described as \"an effort to maintain the grizzly bear population in that ecosystem.\"\n\nSome of the bruins that were cooped up simply walked - or ran - out of the holding box and back into their natural habitat. Obviously, wild animals aren't going to be cool with being caged, so some of them were a little bit more... let's just say \"energized\" to get out of the contraption and back into the free world.\n\nBut one of the grizzly bears that they released, a staggering male beast that had to be pushing the highest weight threshold for its species, got particularly violent when the door came open and it was time to return into the wild. Once it was free, it immediately fought back, and by that I mean it attacked the cage and the vehicle that was transporting it.\n\nThankfully, no one was harmed in the terrifying display of power. Everyone from the Montana FWP Department was still safely inside their vehicle, and waited until the grizzly finally cooled off and left before they pulled their vehicle out of the area.\n\nAs they described in the video shortly before the male grizzly's attack was shown from two different angles:\n\n\"The (last) two videos show the same release of the second adult male grizzly bear. This bear was more aggressive but was safely released and left the site after Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks staff honked the truck horn.\n\nThis reaction is not typical for most releases, but shows why grizzly bears must be respected and why FWP is always extra cautious when working with grizzly bears.\"\n\nThat should be a good enough warning for you before you press play:", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grizzly bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horn (anatomy)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Bear-cage.jpg?fit=1072%2C657&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745638", "eventUri": "eng-9745638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 231320604, "title": "Hoping to deal a blow to Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n, challenger holds mass demonstration on eve of EU election", "text": "By JUSTIN SPIKE (Associated Press) BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 A rising political newcomer hoping to deal a blow to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n mobilized tens of thousands of supporters in Budapest on Saturday in a final show of strength on the eve of a European Parliament election. P\u00e9ter Magyar, a 43-year-old lawyer who in a matter of months has built up Hungary\u2019s strongest opposition party, hopes to use a good showing in Sunday\u2019s EU elections to propel himself and his movement toward defeating the nationalist Orb\u00e1n in the next national ballot scheduled for 2026. Once an insider within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, Magyar has gained quick prominence through publicly accusing the prime minister and his allies of corruption and anti-democratic tendencies. He has drawn thousands of curious spectators on a tour of nearly 200 Hungarian cities, towns and villages in the last two months. In the blazing heat on Saturday, Magyar addressed the sprawling crowd that filled Budapest Heroes\u2019 Square, saying that he and his movement would build \u201ca more beautiful, peaceful and happy country\u201d and bring an end to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s 14 years in power. \u201cI was a spark that started the motor of change,\u201d he said. Recent polls show that Fidesz is likely to take a relative majority of votes in Sunday\u2019s election, but that Magyar\u2019s party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA), could gain up to 30% and cause a loss of seats for Fidesz among Hungary\u2019s 21-member delegation in the EU legislature. TISZA has gained its base of support among voters disillusioned by both Orb\u00e1n\u2019s illiberal form of governance and Hungary\u2019s traditional opposition parties, which have proven unable to mount a serious challenge to the populist leader\u2019s rule since 2010. One Magyar supporter, 69-year-old Budapest resident M\u00e1ria N\u00e9meth, said on Saturday that she hasn\u2019t voted in any election since 2010, when she supported Hungary\u2019s right-wing Jobbik party. But now, she said, she plans to vote for TISZA because of the \u201cfilth and lies\u201d in Hungarian politics that she attributes to Orb\u00e1n \u2014 particularly about the war in Ukraine. \u201cIf P\u00e9ter Magyar hadn\u2019t come around, I wouldn\u2019t vote,\u201d N\u00e9meth said. \u201cThey tell so many lies about the war. Everyone wants peace, whether on the left or the right, everyone wants peace.\u201d Orb\u00e1n, known as the EU\u2019s closest Kremlin ally, has cast the stakes of Sunday\u2019s election as nothing less than peace in Europe if his party wins, or a global conflagration if it loses. He has blamed \u201cpro-war\u201d politicians in Washington and Brussels for escalating tensions with Russia over its war in Ukraine, and portrayed his refusal to supply Kyiv with military aid and other support as a \u201cpro-peace\u201d position unique in Europe. During his campaign, Orb\u00e1n has claimed that a vote for those running against him would risk Hungarian youth being sent to the front lines in Ukraine. Magyar has pushed back on the claim, and on Saturday lifted a slogan Orb\u00e1n has used to promote his own party. \u201cThose who vote for peace vote for TISZA,\u201d he said. A staunch opponent of immigration, Orb\u00e1n has also campaigned on a promise that he will preserve Hungary as a \u201cmigrant-free\u201d country, and has correlated past armed conflicts in Europe with what he sees as a deficit of \u201cwhite Christians\u201d on the continent. \u201cIn the two (world) wars, 57 million Europeans died, and people are amazed that there aren\u2019t enough Christian, white, traditional Europeans in Europe,\u201d he said at a campaign rally on Thursday. \u201cInstead, there\u2019s a vacuum filled by migrants.\u201d Magyar has dismissed accusations by Orb\u00e1n that he \u2014 or any other Hungarians \u2014 are \u201cpro-war.\u201d In an interview with The Associated Press in May, he was unequivocal in pointing out the potential risks if Russia was permitted to retain the Ukrainian territories that it has occupied \u2014 including the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. In his final message to voters before the election on Saturday, he said he would to bring an end to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s \u201cfear-mongering propaganda,\u201d and work for a country where \u201cthere\u2019s no left, no right, there\u2019s only Hungarians.\u201d \u201cTISZA aims to ensure that Hungarian families can live in peace and security, and that our children can live without the fear of war. The future is up to you now,\u201d he said.", "summary": "A rising political newcomer hoping to deal a blow to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#225;n has mobilized tens of thousands of supporters in the country's capital in a final show of strength on the eve of a European Parliament election.

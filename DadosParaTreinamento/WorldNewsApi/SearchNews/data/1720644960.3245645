Judo fans are consistently surprised by the rising power of a new judo nation. The most familiar name is, of course, former World Ranking leader Temur Rakhimov. Insiders recognize Somon Makhmadbekov as a reliable medal contender, but since Nurali Emomali's Junior World title in 2022, Tajikistan has increasingly become a significant force on the judo map. This momentum was particularly evident during the 2023 Grand Prix in Dushanbe, where the home country had numerous opportunities to excel with strong support from a knowledgeable crowd. The event's upgrade to Grand Slam level showcased another prodigy, Quvatov, who emerged victorious. In the U66kg category, Tajikistan faces the luxury of having two top athletes vying for one Olympic spot. One of the standout judokas is Obid Dzhebov, who has shown remarkable prowess in the -66 kg category. Despite his impressive track record, Dzhebov narrowly missed securing a spot in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Ultimately, it was Emomali who qualified, leaving Dhzebov without a place. Dhzebov lost to Matteo Piras (ITA) for a spot in the quarter-finals of the World Championships. 26-Year old Obid Dzhebov was born in Tver, Russia, and later moved to Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he currently resides. He began his judo journey in 2001, inspired by his brother Anushervon. Training at Hoji Sharif Tajikistan under the guidance of coaches Foteh Makhmadbekov and Tori Tamura, Dzhebov has developed into a formidable competitor on the international stage. Dzhebov's recent accomplishments highlight his growing dominance in the -66 kg category. He clinched gold at the 2023 Grand Prix in Dushanbe and silver in 2024. Additionally, he earned a silver medal at the 2023 Grand Slam in Ulaanbaatar and a bronze at the 2024 Grand Slam in Antalya. His consistency and skill have earned him recognition, but the fierce competition for Olympic qualification spots meant that he fell just short of making it to Paris. The road to the Olympics is fraught with challenges, and Dzhebov's journey was no exception. Competing in a highly competitive weight category, he faced tough opponents and intense matches. At the latest World Championships, he finished 17th in his category, further underscoring the level of competition he contended with. Dzhebov's commitment to judo is evident in his extensive training regime in Dushanbe and his participation in numerous international competitions. Despite his strong performances, the points accumulated by his competitors edged him out of an Olympic berth. Background Beyond judo, Dzhebov's life is enriched by his family, including his wife, son, parents, brother Anushervon, and two sisters. He is also inspired by his cousin, Tolib Dzhebov, who competes in the -66 kg category as well. Dzhebov is a fan of football, particularly Chelsea, and draws inspiration from mixed martial artist Khabib Nurmagomedov, a 29-time undefeated UFC champion and two-time world sambo champion. These influences have shaped Dzhebov's approach to judo, combining dedication, discipline, and a competitive spirit. While Obid Dzhebov will not be competing in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, he has demonstrated significant potential for the future. The power of Tajikistan will only increase. Dzhebov is poised to achieve more milestones in the years to come.", "url": "https://judoinside.com/news/6694/Tajikistan_on_the_rise_Dzhebov_in_the_waiting_room", "image": "https://judoinside.com/photos/hans/2023/Grand_Slam_Tashkent/2023_jh_tashkent_day1_nurali_emomali.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:24:45", "author": "Google Inc,Judoinside", "authors": ["Google Inc", "Judoinside"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.473}

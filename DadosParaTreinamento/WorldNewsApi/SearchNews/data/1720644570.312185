{"id": 231222016, "title": "Woman 'wins the lottery' with rare KitKat \u2013 but people say it's an unlucky find", "text": "A woman was told she had won the chocolate \"lottery\" after she ate a rare KitKat, but there are some saying the find was very unlucky. Posting a photograph of the unusual chocolate to r/CasualUK, the Reddit user wrote: \"My husband says I've won the kit kat lottery. Just had a KitKat chunky and got no wafer! I was a bit disappointed but my husband says he's very jealous and I've won the KitKat lottery.\" But jealousy over the rare find soon turned into criticism as Reddit users said the whole point of a KitKat is the biscuit inside the chocolate shell. One user wrote: \"Why would you be happy if a KitKat has no wafer? Isn't that the point.\" Others suggested it was no longer a KitKat as the wafer was missing, and likened the chocolate to a Yorkie. One person asked: \"Isn't that just a Yorkie?\" Another wrote: \"If you want just chocolate you can buy just chocolate.\" The original poster revealed in another comment: \"I took a bite and thought it was just the solid chocolate bit off the end. Soon realised it wasn't!\" A few Reddit users claimed to have suffered the same wafer free fate and suggested contacting Nestle for a free KitKat voucher. One user wrote: \"You can report this to Nestle and they will send you a voucher (I've done this before).\" Another user recalled the time his sister received no wafer and was given bundles of KitKat chocolates as an apology. \"My sister had this as a kid,\" they claimed. \"Wrote a letter to KitKat and they sent a gift pack as an apology with loads for us.\" Another Redditor user claimed waferless KitKats used to be a common occurrence. They wrote: \"You used to get random solid chocolate kitkats quite frequently. I assumed they were a thing of the past.\"", "summary": "A woman was told she had 'won the KitKat lottery' after finding an extremely rare version of the favourite chocolatey treat, but not everyone has said they would be thrilled with the discovery", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/woman-wins-lottery-rare-kitkat-32988153", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32988228.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-08-at-122749.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:39:36", "author": "Ewan Gleadow,Ewan-Gleadow", "authors": ["Ewan Gleadow", "Ewan-Gleadow"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.832}

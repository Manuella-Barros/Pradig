Against billows and tides, truth became his refuge.\n\nKabiyesi can look back, with gratitude to the Almighty God and take pride in the phenomenal progress Ijebuland has witnessed under his peaceful reign. Among monarchs, he continues to command respect and admiration. More important, he has seen his kingdom and people flourish in leaps and bounds during his reign.\n\nI have always enjoyed the trust, friendship and confidence of Kabiyesi Awujale Ogbagba ll in the course of my political journey, through the struggles of our fight for the return of democratic governance in our country and beyond my tenure as Governor of Lagos State. Throughout these epochs in my political odyssey, Oba Adetona has remained a pillar of strength and support. In matters of fighting for justice, fairness, equity and a more just society where every part of our country can progress and our people live peacefully and in harmony with each other, Kabiyesi has been a dependable ally.\n\nAs my confidant, I have absolute faith and trust in Awujale and I have benefited from his wise counsel over the years.\n\nWhen I set out to seek the highest office in our country, I began my nationwide consultation from his palace in 2022. In keeping faith with my promise, I returned in June last year to pay homage and express my gratitude.\n\nKabiyesi has fought for and invested heavily in democracy and good governance and to cap it all, he endowed a chair in that discipline at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago Iwoye, in Ogun State, where he built a School of Post-Graduate and Research Studies in Governance.\n\nOba Adetona has earned his stripes as a forward-looking and venerable royal father not just in Yorubaland but across the world. He is one of the longest reigning monarchs in the world with over six decades on the throne.\n\nKabiyesi has lived well and served well. We will continue to honour his service to humanity and commitment to duty.\n\nNow that he has joined the prestigious Club of Nonagenarians, I can only wish him more years in good health on the throne of his forebears.", "source": {"uri": "nta.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTA Network News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hakeem_adedayo@nta.ng", "name": "Hakeem Adedayo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikiru_Kayode_Adetona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikiru Kayode Adetona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oba_(ruler)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oba (ruler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awujale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Awujale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorubaland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yorubaland"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_traditional_rulers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian traditional rulers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Lagos_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Lagos State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ago-Iwoye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ago-Iwoye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olabisi_Onabanjo_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olabisi Onabanjo University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogun_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ogun State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ogun State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Oba-Sikiru.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554206", "eventUri": "eng-9554206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Sunday at the age of 61 following a short illness.\n\nA spokesperson for the charity described her as a \"force for nature\" and said she led the organisation with \"passion, energy and dedication\", spearheading areas of work including farming with a renewed focus on nature and peatland restoration.\n\nThis included a 10-year plan to restore a commercially-harvested bog near Omagh in a first-of-its kind project that would return peat-forming plants to the site and help it store carbon.\n\nIn recent years, Ms Fulton also worked with the Department for Infrastructure to guide it in a new approach to verge management that ensures the protection of wildlife and the promotion of biodiversity.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, an Ulster Wildlife spokesperson said: \"Her commitment and

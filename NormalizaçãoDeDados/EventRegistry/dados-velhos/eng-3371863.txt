U.S. companies are expected to issue $5.2 billion in green bonds this year, meaning a green label for Tesla's offering last week would have grown U.S. corporate issuance in 2017 by more than a third, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.\n\nTesla, whose declared mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, didn't need the label as much as the nascent green bond market needed Tesla. Green bonds are a way for big companies to highlight their sustainable credentials, and also to help little-known renewable energy companies get the attention of institutional investors with like-minded interests. Tesla doesn't fit in either of those buckets.\n\n\"Even if a company does know what a green bond is, and understands that they could issue one, they may not see any outright benefits in doing so, versus the costs and commitments associated with issuing a green bond,\" Daniel Shurey, a green bonds analyst at BNEF, said in an email.\n\nCompanies that issue green bonds say they help attract a more diverse and long-term oriented group of investors than they would otherwise. They're betting the label can improve liquidity, lead to more committed bondholders or at least raise their profile among green investors. Global assets linked to sustainable and responsible investing strategies hit $23 trillion at the end of 2015, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.\n\nSolarCity Corp. was one of the most frequent issuers of green bonds before Tesla bought it in 2016. The company used the offerings as a way to raise low-cost money directly from environmentally friendly investors.\n\nPalo Alto, California-based Tesla didn't comment on why it chose not to designate the recent offering as green. But with the company led by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk already a household name in zero-emission automobiles, it may not have needed to spend the extra money and time to snag the certification.\n\nInterest was high for Tesla's debt sale regardless, with the B3/B- rated deal aimed at supporting production of its mass-market Model 3 electric car increased to $1.8 billion from the original $1.5 billion. The 5.3 percent coupon was a record low for a bond of its rating and maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nCosts to certify an offering as green can vary significantly. Sean Kidney, chief executive and co-founder of the Climate Bonds Initiative, estimates annual certification costs at between $18,000 and $41,000. Tesla choosing not to label its bond green was a \"missed opportunity\" for a fledgling sector hungry for another marquee name, he said.\n\n\"At the very minimum issuing green bonds for Tesla is a way to highlight its obvious green credentials to an investment community that is thirsty for green bonds,\" said Kidney, whose London-based nonprofit aims to grow the environmentally friendly bond market.\n\nThough corporate green bonds continue to lag, issuers globally are expected to sell a record $131 billion green bonds this year, up from from just $5 billion in 2012, BNEF data show. The pickup has been led by development banks, municipalities and sovereign issuers who've jumped into the market to meet global climate change goals.\n\nInvestors with more than $11 trillion in assets have signed onto the Paris Green Bonds Statement, aimed at boosting issuance in the market. Ethical investors, ranging from millennials to public pensions, increasingly seek out the bonds as a way to offset broader climate risks in their portfolios. Many green offerings are several times oversubscribed and underwriters report rapidly filling order books for green bonds.\n\n\"There just aren't enough green bonds to go around,\" BNEF's Shurey said.\n\nCorporate green bonds have taken hold more quickly at European companies, as issuers there face more pressure from central banks and institutional investors to help lower carbon emissions. In the U.S., companies have been more hesitant amid concerns about backing up their green credentials legally or being accused of \"greenwashing,\" or trumping up their commitments to clean energy.\n\nA handful of other automakers including the finance arms of Hyundai Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have issued green bonds to fund consumer purchases or development of electric vehicles. In those cases, green investors may have needed the label to see that the proceeds were going to projects they supported.\n\n\"There is a tacit acceptance by green bond funds that their investible universe is, at least at present, limited,\" Alastair Sewell, a senior director at Fitch Ratings' fund and asset manager rating group in London, said in an email. \"In the case of Tesla, were a green bond fund to consider Tesla sufficiently 'green' in and of itself, then it might consider the issue despite it not being a labeled green bond.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

The pickup has been led by development banks, municipalities and sovereign issuers who've jumped into the market to meet global climate change goals.\n\nGreen Demand\n\nInvestors with more than $11-trillion in assets have signed onto the Paris Green Bonds Statement, aimed at boosting issuance in the market. Ethical investors, ranging from millennials to public pensions, increasingly seek out the bonds as a way to offset broader climate risks in their portfolios. Many green offerings are several times oversubscribed and underwriters report rapidly filling order books for green bonds.\n\n\"There just aren't enough green bonds to go around,\" BNEF's Shurey said.\n\nCorporate green bonds have taken hold more quickly at European companies, as issuers there face more pressure from central banks and institutional investors to help lower carbon emissions. In the U.S., companies have been more hesitant amid concerns about backing up their green credentials legally or being accused of \"greenwashing,\" or trumping up their commitments to clean energy.\n\nA handful of other automakers including the finance arms of Hyundai Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have issued green bonds to fund consumer purchases or development of electric vehicles. In those cases, green investors may have needed the label to see that the proceeds were going to projects they supported.\n\n\"There is a tacit acceptance by green bond funds that their investible universe is, at least at present, limited,\" Alastair Sewell, a senior director at Fitch Ratings' fund and asset manager rating group in London, said in an email. \"In the case of Tesla, were a green bond fund to consider Tesla sufficiently 'green' in and of itself, then it might consider the issue despite it not being a labeled green bond.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

U.S. companies are expected to issue $5.2 billion in green bonds this year, meaning a green label for Tesla's offering last week would have grown U.S. corporate issuance in 2017 by more than a third, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.\n\nTesla, whose declared mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, didn't need the label as much as the nascent green bond market needed Tesla. Green bonds are a way for big companies to highlight their sustainable credentials, and also to help little-known renewable energy companies get the attention of institutional investors with like-minded interests. Tesla doesn't fit in either of those buckets.\n\n\"Even if a company does know what a green bond is, and understands that they could issue one, they may not see any outright benefits in doing so, versus the costs and commitments associated with issuing a green bond,\" Daniel Shurey, a green bonds analyst at BNEF, said in an email.\n\nCompanies that issue green bonds say they help attract a more diverse and long-term oriented group of investors than they would otherwise. They're betting the label can improve liquidity, lead to more committed bondholders or at least raise their profile among green investors. Global assets linked to sustainable and responsible investing strategies hit $23 trillion at the end of 2015, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.\n\nSolarCity Corp. was one of the most frequent issuers of green bonds before Tesla bought it in 2016. The company used the offerings as a way to raise low-cost money directly from environmentally friendly investors.\n\nPalo Alto, California-based Tesla didn't comment on why it chose not to designate the recent offering as green. But with the company led by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk already a household name in zero-emission automobiles, it may not have needed to spend the extra money and time to snag the certification.\n\nCosts, Commitments\n\nInterest was high for Tesla's debt sale regardless, with the B3/B- rated deal aimed at supporting production of its mass-market Model 3 electric car increased to $1.8 billion from the original $1.5 billion. The 5.3 percent coupon was a record low for a bond of its rating and maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale was managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nCosts to certify an offering as green can vary significantly. Sean Kidney, chief executive and co-founder of the Climate Bonds Initiative, estimates initial certification costs at between $18,000 and $41,000.

Issuance from emerging markets has jumped from $2.3 billion to $9.2 billion year-on-year, about half the total from developed markets, versus 16 percent a year ago.\n\nSouth Africa's Cape Town, Argentina's La Rioja Province, Brazil's BNDES and the National Bank of Abu Dhabi have all tapped the market, while Malaysia's Tadau Energy sold the world's first green Islamic bond, or sukuk.\n\n\"The market is stretching the boundaries ... The push is there and I don't see this abating in the near term,\" said Rahul Sheth, executive director at Standard Chartered, said.\n\nChina accounts for over two-thirds of total emerging market green issuance and a fifth of the global tally, even though it is classed as the world's bigger polluter by carbon emissions.\n\nIt issued $23 billion of green bonds in 2016, up from just $1 billion in 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI).\n\nChina's green bond boom reflects an official push for cleaner energy, says Sherry Madera, the City of London's special adviser for Asia. Just 2 percent of Chinese local debt is \"green\" but this must rise tenfold for Beijing to meet its climate change objectives, she said.\n\nAt the other end, meanwhile, investor demand is growing. In Europe, Fitch identified 17 dedicated green bond funds whose assets have risen by 400 percent since 2015.\n\nThis means issuers can tap investors who might not have bought a conventional bond from the same place, says Bertrand Gacon, head of impact at Lombard Odier.\n\nInvestors get similar returns to ordinary bonds, but with an additional environmental benefit. \"So for many institutions and private clients it's just a no-brainer to switch part of their allocation into green bonds,\" he said.\n\nGREENWASHING\n\nBut emerging green bond markets are still bedevilled by variations in standards and scepticism over how the proceeds will be used if there is no third-party verification.\n\nLombard Odier's Global Climate Bond fund, for example, did not buy Poland's sovereign green bond, issued last year, concerned about issuer responsibility and so-called greenwashing. This is where an issuer promotes green initiatives but operates in a way that damages the environment.\n\n\"To protect its coal industry, (Poland) has repeatedly vetoed climate policies and obstructed negotiations both at EU and international levels and is seen to be infringing EU law through its continued subsidies,\" said Stuart Kinnersley, chief executive of Affirmative Investment Management, which co-manages the fund with Lombard Odier.\n\nThe Polish bond was still oversubscribed, but this is not unusual for green bonds. The Polish Finance Ministry said in an emailed response that it had followed international principles and also sought outside opinion on the use of proceeds.\n\nThe opinion was that the proceeds from the bond \"will have clear positive environmental impacts\", it said.\n\nIn China's case, meanwhile, only 10 percent of green bonds sold last year had independent verification on the use of proceeds.\n\nOne issue is that Chinese green bond guidelines allow funding for \"clean coal\" power stations, which do not qualify under other market standards. Such disparities may stifle cross-border green capital flows; currently most buyers of Chinese green bonds are Asian.\n\n\"If EM issuers want to tap into (the Western sustainable) investor class then they have to think about what standards they are following and whether the European investor will be interested in projects whose green credentials are less clear-cut, such as clean coal,\" said Rahul Ghosh, a senior credit officer at Moody's.\n\nChina has acknowledged the issue and the state-run Bank of China successfully raised $500 million from a green bond issued in London last year. The deal was oversubscribed 1.8 times, attracting European investors.\n\nAnother problem is that aside from the odd large deal such as Mexico City Airport's $2 billion issue, average issuance size is around $270-$500 million. Investors say they need bonds of at least $1 billion for meaningful exposure and to boost trading volume.\n\nThe World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and asset manager Amundi are seeking to combat this through aggregation, creating a $2 billion fund to stimulate emerging market bank issuance.\n\n\"Banks can be an aggregator of small projects -- some solar panels here, a wind farm there -- all these little projects couldn't issue green bonds themselves as the critical mass wouldn't be achieved,\" said Frederic Samama, deputy global head of institutional and sovereign clients at Amundi.\n\nOnly 10-12 percent will initially be invested in green bonds, with the rest in standard debt. After seven years, though, the aim is to have 100 percent in green bonds from emerging markets.\n\n(Reporting by Claire Milhench; additional reporting by Pawel Sobczak in Warsaw)\n\nSEARCH", "date":

Rapid urbanisation is transforming cities like Hanoi, and the quiet streets of a few decades ago are today unrecognisable. The question remains - how green is Vietnam's sprawl?\n\nBuildings account for around 36 per cent of the country's total energy consumption and 25 per cent of emissions, including a third of carbon dioxide emissions - the main cause of global climate change.\n\nThe concept of green construction was introduced for the first time in the country in 2007. Ten years later Vietnam has just 61 constructions with sustainable green certificates. This number is far too modest in a rapidly-developing country where new urban areas are booming. Neighbours like Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are doing much better, and Singapore alone boasts more than 2,100 green buildings with a Green Mark certification.\n\nAs the country shifts from a rural-agrarian society to an urban-industrial, services-based economy, Vietnam is seeing a significant increase in urbanisation, which stands at approximately 30 per cent today and is expected to increase to 45 per cent by 2020.\n\nThe Government and real estate developers are beginning to take green buildings seriously, with an eye to improving energy efficiency, reducing the toll of urbanisation on the environment and mitigating the effects of climate change.\n\nThe Energy Conservation Centre (ECC) was established in 2002 to provide support and consultancy for energy saving in construction. Additionally. the Ministry of Construction promulgated building standards encouraging energy efficiency and the reduction of emissions.\n\nA US-funded programme is providing significant help in implementing an action plan for green growth in the building sector. The programme offers building owners free technical support to provide building energy simulations that can help them achieve substantial energy and green house gas reductions for their newly-designed and retrofitted building demonstration projects.\n\nWith expertise drawn from US-based developers, local urban managers will be given training on integrated design and knowledge about energy requirements, helping to incorporate the Vietnam Energy Efficiency Building Code (VEEBC) into the building sector's action plan for green growth.\n\nUp to 3,000 architects, engineers, project managers, government officials and builders from 40 provinces have already benefited from the programme's training courses, receiving technical knowledge and skills to effectively enforce and implement the VEEBC. 280 buildings have also been surveyed in order to develop a national database on building energy performance.\n\nWith new technology, the construction of green buildings is becoming ever easier. Current building practices are getting cheaper and the threat of climate change looms large over policy decisions. In creating greener structures, the benefits of green building can range from environmental to economic to social.\n\nMany developed countries have already taken note of the benefits provided by green buildings and put their own plans into action. Steps like these help countries save energy, protect the environment, and provide a healthier environment for citizens. Green buildings clearly bring significant value to growing cities. They also make good business sense. If planned well, green buildings cause little or no increase in construction costs, and can actually save money in the long run.\n\nVietnam is among countries suffering the most from climate change, and even in recent years has struggled with rising sea levels, severe droughts and heavy flooding. This prompted the government to prepare a national action plan for green growth from 2014-2020.\n\nHowever, the government lacks specific policies to encourage green buildings. Support is needed to encourage investment, particularly towards the lower end of the market. Preferential policies on land and credit will help more developers consider green construction, and work to dispel notions that this type of construction is prohibitively expensive. Programmes like the one detailed above attempt to demystify the issue for both the public and professionals within the real estate sector.\n\nThe Vietnam Real Estate Association signed a memorandum of understanding with property developers earlier this year, committing them to develop green properties between now and 2022.\n\nThe agreement covers three main tasks: completing a legal framework for green buildings, training in green buildings for real estate firms and increasing public awareness on the issue, thus enhancing the popularity of green housing products.\n\nThe first developer to support the programme was Capital House, offering a contribution of US$1 million. The company has committed to researching energy-saving solutions and using environmentally-friendly building materials. Three out of its five projects, including some low-priced housing, have been awarded the EDGE green building certification, created for emerging markets by IFC, a member of the World Bank Group.\n\nOther developers such as FLC Group, Viglacera, CEO Group, Alphanam, Phuc Khang and West Lake International Tower Company have also signed up.\n\nIt is moves like these that ensure green construction will become a trend in the real estate sector and expand its reach beyond the high-end segment. Better provision of knowledge among firms and the wider public is needed, and this will require more government support and policies that encourage greener growth.\n\nThe green buildings market in Vietnam is still in its infancy, primarily as a result of cost sensitivity, low electricity prices, short-term thinking and a limited supply of skilled employees with green building awareness. However, with programmes supporting development within the sector, moves towards market-based electricity pricing, and global corporate guidelines requiring green practices, the market is seeing a belief in green construction begin to take root.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"},

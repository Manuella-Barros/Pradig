{"id": 231274392, "title": "Taylor Swift Eras Tour: 10-year-old girl left heartbroken after being rushed to hospital during Edinburgh show", "text": "A 10-year-old girl who attended the Taylor Swift concert in Edinburgh last night has been left \u2018heartbroken\u2019 after she was forced to leave the sell-out show early due to a medical scare. Sienna Dell, who has complex health issues and receives medication through IVs 12-16 hours a day, developed a fever during the concert and was later rushed to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Sienna and her mum, Mandy Dell, had been looking forward to seeing Taylor Swift for months - travelling 10 hours on the train from London and spending all their savings to watch the global pop icon perform. Mandy is now hoping her daughter can get a \u2018second chance\u2019 to see her idol at a future date of the Eras Tour which is travelling to Liverpool, Cardiff, London and Dublin later in the summer. Speaking to the Evening News, Mandy said: \u201cSienna is a massive Taylor Swift fan and it was her dream to be at the concert and see her idol but sadly it was cut short. She is heartbroken. Sienna has been though a lot already and she deserved it so much, probably more than most due to her complex medical history so I just hope we can get a second chance at making that dream come true. \u201cEven though she saw the first quarter of the show she wasn\u2019t feeling well. She has an IV line that goes into her heart, and when she gets a fever Sienna has to be admitted to hospital as a part of protocol for sepsis.\u201d Mandy spent around \u00a31,000 on tickets and accommodation for the long-awaited event, with Sienna making 148 friendship bracelets to give out to people in the crowd and picking out a special outfit for the show. Mandy said the trip to Edinburgh had been seven months in the making and \u2018it was supposed to be special memory for us.\u2019 A video shared online by Mandy shows Sienna full of emotion as she watches the American pop sensation perform at Edinburgh\u2019s Murrayfield Stadium. Dressed in special outfit for the event, a tearful Sienna can be seen leaning on her mum as the pop star sings her hit song Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince. After feeling unwell, Sienna was seen by medical staff on site before travelling to hospital where they both stayed overnight. Mandy said: \u201cShe\u2019s looking brighter after having IV antibiotics and paracetamol and we will find out today if we need to stay here until Monday. - but it could be longer depending on her blood cultures.\u201d Writing on social media, Mandy said: \u201cWe need your help. As many of you know we tried sooo hard to get Sienna to the Taylor Swift concert. She prepped for months and we used all our savings to make this come true. \u201cWe travelled from London to Scotland yesterday and she was buzzing, but unfortunately a quarter of the way through I had to keep removing Sienna from the stadium as she wasn\u2019t feeling great. I thought as first she was just overwhelmed but unfortunately Sienna did become unwell and was blue lighted to Edinburgh kids hospital.\u201d Mandy added: \u201cWe would really like a second chance and for her to get the chance to either [go again or get a] message from Taylor or anything at this point really. She is devastated. Can you help us reach Taylor Swift?\u201d", "summary": "<p>Sienna and her mum Mandy had been looking forward to the sell-out show for months</p>", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/taylor-swift-eras-tour-10-year-old-girl-left-heartbroken-after-being-rushed-to-hospital-during-edinburgh-show-4658368", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/06/08/12/32/Taylor%20Swift%20Eras%20Tour%20Edinburgh%20Sienna%20Dell.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:08:13", "author": "Neil Johnstone", "authors": ["Neil Johnstone"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.168}

It\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d The statement continued, \u201cWe would like to thank the PGA Tour and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Life wasn\u2019t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.\u201d Murray\u2019s death was announced by the PGA Tour on Saturday, a day after the 30-year-old withdrew from competition, citing illness, at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas. Earlier this year, Murray won the Sony Open in a playoff against former PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley and South Korea\u2019s An Byeong-hun, ending a six-and-a-half-year winless streak during which he admitted to struggling with mental health and physical issues. Hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina, Murray was regarded as one of the world\u2019s best junior players, capturing three IMG Junior World titles in 2006, \u201907 and \u201908. At age 16, he became the second youngest to make the cut on the PGA\u2019s developmental Korn Ferry Tour, and at age 19 he played in the 2013 US Open, according to the PGA. He went on to win the 2017 Barbasol Championship at just 23 years old.", "summary": "(CNN) \u2014 Professional golfer Grayson Murray died by suicide, his parents confirmed in a statement released through the PGA Tour. \u201cWe have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is...", "url": "https://nation.lk/online/grayson-murray-s-parents-confirm-the-golfer-s-cause-of-death-266395.html", "image": "https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbHducGRjdm4wMDAxMzU2amZ2dHVwYXk5-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2Nsd25vejRjNDAwMG44MnAyZmF1N2FnejU.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:00:07", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "lk", "sentiment": -0.131}

It is quiet, easy to ride, and built for low maintenance and durability. If bicycles were an art form, the e-Classic Plus would be a masterpiece of elemental design. If you want a motorcycle-like e-bike, it's not your ride,. But if you're looking for a stylish electric bicycle to help you enjoy the ride longer, the e-Classic Plus is an excellent choice.\n\nContents Priority e-Classic Plus: realizing the founder's visionPriority e-Classic Plus: the numbers matter lessPriority e-Classic Plus: handling and comfortPriority e-Classic Plus: riding impressionsPriority e-Classic Plus: options and accessoriesOur takeShow 1 more item Related Harley-Davidson rides into the e-bike segment with Serial 1 subbrand Blix drops e-bike prices in shift to selling exclusively online Electric Citi Bikes is returning to New York City with a price shake-up Priority e-Classic Plus: realizing the founder's vision\n\nPriority Bicycles is a New York City-based company that designs high-quality, low-maintenance bikes for everyday use. When I reviewed Priority's e-Coast cruiser e-bike in 2023, I was impressed by the build quality and referred to its \"quiet beauty.\" However, the e-Coast e-bike is heavier, faster, and more expensive than the e-Classic Plus.\n\nPriority launched its first bike, the Priority Classic, via Kickstarter in 2014. The later, upgraded Classic Plus model added a Gates carbon drive belt and a Shimano Nexus internally geared hub. The electrified version, the e-Classic Plus, is based on the upgraded bicycle, but adds a battery, an electric motor, and much more.\n\nCarrying a 49-pound e-bike is a lot easier than a bike that is 15 to 25 pounds heavier.\n\nPriority Bicycles now sells a wide range of conventional bicycles and e-bikes for various purposes, but the e-Classic Plus is the e-bike closest to the founder's original vision of making an e-bike that's easy to maintain, fun and easy to ride on a daily basis, and has quality components that will look good and last for a long time.\n\nPriority e-Classic Plus: the numbers matter less\n\nThe most common questions about e-bikes involve top speed, range, and cost. The top speed of the e-Classic Plus is 20 miles per hour, the maximum range is 60 miles, and the price is $1,699. For several reasons, I'll explain that at least two of those questions aren't the best filters for understanding this e-bike. Those numbers make sense if you're the right rider for the e-Classic Plus. Here's why:\n\nTop speed: The e-Classic Plus is a Class 1 e-bike with a 20 mph maximum power-assisted speed. There's no throttle, so you access power by pedaling, with three levels of pedal assistance. This is the same setup that has made e-bike usage incredibly successful in Europe. It's simple to use - just pedal. Range: You're most likely to have power assistance for 60 miles with a fully charged battery when you pedal in electric power assistance in Level 1, which uses the least amount of battery power. The range is affected by rider and cargo weight, speed, incline, air temperature, and more, but if you only use the power assistance when you really need it and ride at a moderate speed, you could get close to that figure. Riding at faster speeds in pedal assistant Level 1 or Level 3 cuts the range. Priority says the lowest range an average rider should expect is 20 miles. Riding a lightweight bicycle in the city and most towns at 20 mph for 20 miles would probably be more than most riders need. Price: The e-Classic Plus is a high-quality machine. The Gates carbon belt drive, the internally geared Shimano hub and shifter, and even the oversized Tektro hydraulic brakes with 180mm rotors are significant pluses. Looking closely at the components, you'll see bright stainless steel, finely finished painted surfaces, and many thoughtful, well-executed details. You can find good-quality e-bikes for $1,000 or less, but they will not be as nice. The appeal is similar to that of a fine-quality watch.\n\nThe e-Classic Plus has a 36-volt, 250-watt front hub motor and a 36V 10.4Ah rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a maximum total power storage of 374 kilowatt-hours. Most e-bikes I review have 500W or 750W continuous power rear hub motors and batteries with 500 KWh storage or more.\n\nWhy does Priority use relatively low-power electrical components? They are powerful enough to do the job, with an extra bonus: low weight. Large electric motors and batteries account for a hefty portion of the average e-bike's 65 to 75 pounds. The e-Classic Plus is fast enough and has enough range for the intended user, and the e-bike weighs just 49 pounds. So, what at first may seem like a limitation becomes a win because moving or carrying a 49-pound e-bike is a lot easier than a bike that is 15 to 25 pounds heavier.\n\nPriority e-Classic Plus: handling and comfort Previous Next 1 of 4\n\nThe e-Classic Plus is best for people who like to ride bicycles and want an extra boost for long inclines so they can ride further when tired. There is no front or rear suspension, and the 700c by 38mm tires don't have the sidewall flex of fat tires to soften the ride. It's not a woods e-bike, an e-mountain bike, or an all-terrain adventure bike.\n\nThis bike is best suited for riding on roads, paths, and sidewalks, where you don't need the extra bulk and weight of front suspension forks, rear shocks, and massive fat tires. The standard seat is as plush as it is attractive, although Priority sells an optional wider seat for riders who want broader support.\n\nRiding the e-Classic Plus on the streets in our town was a pleasure.\n\nThe Gates carbon drive belt has several rider advantages. It's quieter and cleaner than steel bicycle chains. It doesn't need grease or adjustment, so no maintenance is required. The Shimano 3-speed internally geared hub is quieter than a regular external derailleur, and the enclosed gears won't kick off a chain or belt. The Shimano gear shifter on the right side of the handlebar twists easily to change gears.\n\nThe e-Classic Plus display on the left side of the handlebar has three buttons for power on/off, changing pedal assist levels, turning the headlight and combination taillight/brake light on or off, and engaging walk mode.\n\nThe e-bike also includes fenders with mudguards and a convenient center stand, which is more stable than a kickstand. Priority does not include a mirror, which I think is a must-have for town or city riding, or turn signals, which are nice to have but not as important as a mirror. Priority sells an optional mirror on its accessories page.\n\nPriority e-Classic Plus: riding impressions\n\nI'm not much of a bicycle rider, but I enjoyed riding the e-Classic Plus with the power turned off. Anyone who regularly rides bicycles may find they don't even turn on the power until they need the lights or begin to get tired. Those are the folks who'll likely see 60 miles or more per charge.\n\nRiding the e-Classic Plus on the streets in our town was a pleasure. I never felt that the lack of front or rear suspension was an issue. The Tektro hydraulic brakes with 180mm disc rotors stopped quickly and surely. Many much heavier e-bikes make do with harder-to-use mechanical brakes and smaller rotors.\n\nI reached the 20 mph top speed once on a moderate decline, but when pedaling on level ground in Level 3 with the Shinamo in third gear, the bike maintained 18 mph easily, but wouldn't go faster. I suspect that speed will be fine for Priority's intended customers.\n\nWhen I rode the e-Classic Plus on grass and in a crushed stone parking lot, it felt OK, but not great. The tires have a bit of give in the tread for various surfaces, but this is a road bike.\n\nI was pleased and frankly surprised that it had sufficient torque to go up our relatively steep, long driveway from a standing stop. I usually test e-bikes using the throttle alone, but since the e-Classic Plus is a pedal assist-only bike, I pedaled from a standing stop. The first rotation was a bit tough, but the power assistance responded, and before I was halfway up the driveway, the motor was doing the work.\n\nPriority e-Classic Plus: options and accessories\n\nAs mentioned above, Priority sells accessories and upgrades for the e-Classic Plus. In addition to a replacement seat -- which most people won't need -- and a handlebar-mounted mirror that I recommend, you'll find an assortment of accessory racks, bags, and locks. Accessories add weight, so I'd recommend keeping them to a minimum, other than a mirror.\n\nOur take\n\nI highly recommend the classy Priority e-Classic Plus e-bike for riders who are willing to pay a bit more for high-quality components that work well and look great. Sure, there are cheaper e-bikes, but if you aren't looking only at cost, two other higher-than-average-quality bikes to consider are the $1,699 Velotric T1 and the $1,199 Aventon Soltera.2.\n\nEditors' Recommendations The best electric bikes for 2023 Bosch Kiox and SmartphoneHub hands-on: The sleek displays e-bikes deserve Rad Power Bikes' new e-bike models boost accessibility

Right out of the box, it's clear that the design ethos of this bike is very different from what the Chinese manufacturer has produced so far.\n\nHistorically, Engwe is well known for super chunky tires and oversized frames, but neither can be found here. The P275 Pro has a sleek and slim frame that not only makes the bike relatively light, but also look great. The tires are much thinner, but still quite thick in comparison to some of the best electric bikes out there right now. The Tenways CGO600 Pro has a better tire width.\n\nThe build quality is all-around excellent. The aluminum alloy frame is beautifully welded together, with cables tucked neatly away within the frame itself. A vast reduction in cable ties is another significant improvement over their other e-bikes.\n\nOne of the downsides of the frame is the minimum seat height of 91.5cm. This will be too high for a lot of riders so make sure you check your ideal seat height before purchasing this e-bike\n\nAnother divergence for Engwe is the choice of branded parts right across the e-bike. It all begins with a 36V, 19.2Ah Samsung Lithium-ion battery that provides up to 150 km range when using the highest level of assist. The Bafang 250W Brushless Mid-drive Motor is ideal for use in the UK and provides just enough power when navigating medium inclines. The automatic gear shifter also helps to keep the bike moving when handling more challenging hills.\n\nAll in all, the P275 Pro is a great bike and represents an excellent direction for the company as a whole. With a great design, good build quality, and a range of branded parts, there aren't many downsides to this e-bike.\n\nThe Engwe P275 Pro has been designed specifically for the EU market and is available for \u00a31,899. It comes in two different color combos: straight black or a gorgeous black frame with a standout orange battery case. Engwe sent me the one with the orange highlight, and I can say it's quite the design statement.\n\nOther than the e-bike, you'll also get a Samsung 36V, 19.2Ah Lithium-ion battery with a compatible charger. A rear light is provided, but it's not integrated, which is disappointing. The sad times were slightly overcome when I saw the cool horn-like bell design. It's a neat change that's also very functional.\n\nIf you're after a more complete package, including accessories, then you can buy two different types of rack bag or even an additional battery.\n\nThe P275 Pro not only looks great, but is also built well. This is a premium e-bike that is available in either black or as a black-and-orange combo. Personally, I prefer to blend into the background, but if you want to stand out, then the color combo will be a great way to do that.\n\nThe diamond-shaped aluminum alloy frame delicately blends sharp turns with smooth flows to give an attractive design. The main frame flows beautifully into the Bafang motor, and the carbon belt rather than a chain means this bike glides effortlessly, whether power-assisted or not.\n\nAt 27.5 x 2.4 cm, the tires are uncharacteristically thin for Engwe and look the part for an urban bike. They are slim enough to reduce traction and wide enough to provide the necessary grip. The slim frame also results in a more than manageable 25.3 kg (55.77 lbs).\n\nPutting the e-bike together was a breeze with all the tools included in the box. Design-wise, the only thing I would have changed would have been the rear light. Engwe has opted to provide a battery-operated light that clips behind the seat. An integrated rear light would have made much more sense and helped to provide a complete package.\n\nThe e-bike ships with an integrated front light, sturdy mudguards, and reflective rims on the wheels. The last of these features is handy for visibility when traffic is approaching from the side. These circular reflectors also look great when lit up.\n\nI'm very impressed with the design of the P275 Pro, and if this is a sign of things to come for Engwe, then I'm very excited indeed.\n\nWith a Bafang 250W Brushless Mid-drive Motor and 65 N.m of torque, the P275 Pro has all the power required for rapid acceleration and when navigating medium-sized inclines. Even though I rarely lacked the power I needed, this e-bike behaves more like a push-bike that provides battery power only if you need it. This is a positive in terms of battery performance, but if you're after an e-bike that does most of the work, then this won't be for you.\n\nOne of the standout features of the P275 Pro is the automatic gear shifter that provides three distinct levels. The e-bike moves seamlessly between them depending on the speed of travel and helps to provide a middle option between a single-speed bike and something with an abundance of gears, a little like the software-driven Cowboy 4. The automatic nature of the shifter takes all the guesswork out of gear-changing and instead aims to further help the pedal assist mode of the e-bike.\n\nThe motor's pedal sensor ensures that power is delivered when needed, although there were times when it took a couple of seconds longer to kick in than I was expecting. That being said, the transition from standing still to moving was always smooth and never abrupt. I'm always wary of e-bikes that are too abrupt because they can lead to accidents, especially when navigating through traffic.\n\nSpeaking of safety, the 180mm front & rear Tektro hydraulic disc brakes provide all the necessary braking capacity at all speeds. They are responsive and reliable, and even though I'm not a fan of this brake type, they are a good match for this bike.\n\nWith a limit of 25 km per hour, the P275 Pro is perfect for the EU market. At this speed, the motor stops and it's all on you. I found it difficult to pedal beyond this speed, mainly due to the motor resistance, something that was particularly noticeable when traveling downhill.\n\nThe P275 boasts a 36V, 19.2Ah SAMSUNG Lithium-ion battery, which Engwe claims provides up to 150 km when using the highest level of pedal assist. I almost always wanted the maximum level of boost and found that a range of around 100 km per charge was more realistic. Having five different assist modes is a little over the top, but it does enable users to manage their battery range if need be.\n\nThe range of an e-bike battery is always dependent on a range of factors, including rider weight, wind resistance, and the amount of surface friction. It's always worth taking the advertised ranges with a pinch of salt and assuming that these are the maximum achievable distances only if ideal riding conditions are met.\n\nTo charge the battery from empty to full, it will take around 5 hours, which will be fine for most people. This fits easily into an overnight charging schedule or even charging it at work before setting off again at the end of the day.\n\nThe battery itself is mounted underneath the seat and stands out even more if you go for the black and orange colour combo. The battery can be easily removed from the frame for easy charging.\n\nAs soon as I got the Engwe P275 Pro, it was hard to put it down. Over several weeks of testing, I enjoyed riding it around the rural area that I live in as well as commuting into the nearest city. As a result, I was able to test the e-bike on a range of terrain and up and down a variety of hills.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the bike's ability to handle wherever I took it, as well as through a range of weather conditions. The brakes were adequate during wet conditions, and the motor got me everywhere I needed to go without too much hassle.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_alloy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium alloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lithium-ion battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafang", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bafang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bafang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cameroon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(slope)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grade (slope)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_rope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire rope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brushless DC electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retroreflector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rack and pinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(vehicle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fender (vehicle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety_Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety Products and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xEerUcxejJYxbaX9sjYpS4-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550757", "eventUri": "eng-9550757", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app.\n\nIt's a sign of the times, seeing a brand that came to relevance touting aero and performance dropping an e-bike. Granted, not many folks expected Cervelo to release a mountain bike either, but now they have two of them! Will the Cervelo Rouvida e-bike follow suit?\n\nThe Rouvida is the company's first entry into the world of e-bikes. Basically, every major brand has an e-bike to some degree, cashing in on the fastest-growing segment of bicycles in the world. And the Rouvida covers the gamut, too, not only offering a road bike option but a gravel option too.\n\nI'm not sure anyone would blame Cervelo for going where the money is at. But what is surprising is how much thought was put into this bike.\n\nThere are myriad ways to make an e-bike. Some bikes are (literally) just standard bicycles with a motor and battery strapped on. Other bikes, however, look and feel like much more cohesive packages.\n\nEven though e-bikes have started to grow in profile over the last eight to 10 years, many folks who would consider themselves hard-core cyclists balk at the idea of riding an e-bike. And it makes sense, right? In many ways, cycling is about the act of self-propulsion to reach a goal, whether that be to a new destination, a podium position, or a new personal best. Cervelo agrees, to an extent.\n\n\"It's not a medical device. Building an e-bike was about making the riding experience more,\" says Cervelo's head of product development Ryan Calilung.\n\n\"From the start, Cervelo's always been about making riders faster. Going fast is fun, regardless of how you get there. And so for us, it was more about bringing the fun that can come with an e-bike in a way that feels like Cervelo.\n\n\"From a product perspective, you can't ignore what e-MTBs did for mountain biking. There are so many positive unintended consequences to that, and so much of it comes from more and more people finding the joy of riding MTB. For us, we see an opportunity for a new category to help people have that same level of fun and engagement.\n\nSo why would a brand associated with winning all three monuments with team Jumbo-Lease A Bike build an e-bike? It's an opportunity to help more folks feel the speed Cervelo is known for. Whether that be with a bit of an assist or not doesn't matter to them.\n\nAnd frankly, it's also about maintaining a loyal but aging fan base. Cervelo first launched in the 1990s and really gained steam in the mid-aughts. More and more of those Cervelo fans are sure to be electric assist curious. So rather than losing those customers to other brands, the Rouvida keeps them in-house.\n\nTo an untrained eye, the Rouvida looks just like a standard Cervelo. The downtube is massive. The tube shapes pull from other bits of Cervelo's more aero-focused lineup. Really, the first sign an unsuspecting rider has that this is an e-bike will likely be the small LED light bar placed on the top tube by the stem.\n\nThe light bar, part of a system called the Fazua LED hub, features five LEDs that show the bike's battery charge status in 20 percent increments. Different colors indicate what level of support the system is set to. The front of the LED hub can be flipped up to access a USB-C charge port, though the plug seems to only provide enough power to prevent your phone from dying mid-ride.\n\nNotably, there's no other display here; riders wanting more info as they ride must pair their system with an existing bike computer or with their smartphone. On the likes of this Garmin Edge 540 Solar, however, the system offers info like battery life, assist levels, and more.\n\nThat light bar belongs to the Fazua Ride 60 system, offering up to a claimed 60 Nm torque. The system is fairly light, at a claimed 1.98 kg (4.36 pounds) for the motor alone and 2.2 kg (4.85 pounds) for Fazua's 430 Wh battery. There's plenty of power here too, with a Boost mode offering up 450 W in short bursts, and 250 Watts otherwise.\n\nA pair of wires from the handlebars lead to a discreet button placed just below the inner edge of each brake hood. This pair of buttons is the only way to turn the bike on and off and control the assist levels. Press and hold the button on the left side to turn the bike on or off. A single press of the right-sided button increases assist, while the left side lowers assist.\n\nAll of that is housed in a carbon frame that doesn't look all that different from Cervelo's own Caledonia all-road/endurance road bike, which itself takes several cues from the rest of Cervelo's more aero-focused road bikes. The sides of the bike appear a bit slab-sided: wide and defined, but somewhat flat in shape with the truncated airfoil shape that is common with most carbon road bikes. Nonetheless, that's not too dissimilar from the Caledonia and Aspero gravel bike.\n\nCable routing technically counts as \"fully-internal,\" though it isn't quite as bad as it could've been. Brake hoses, cables, and assist controller wires are routed externally from the handlebar, under the stem, and then into the top of the headset.\n\nElsewhere, the Rouvida offers a pair of bottle cage mounts placed in the front triangle, and not much else. No additional bag mounts to speak of, and no fender mounts either. The Rouvida uses a SRAM Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH), perhaps the first time I've seen it used on a drop bar bike with a replaceable rear dropout.\n\nCervelo uses the same frame and fork for both the Rouvida gravel builds and road builds, but each build receives a set of dropouts that can be swapped around. The geometry-changing dropouts adopt handling geometry to match the bike's intended uses. The company doesn't call them flip chips, however, as they can't be flipped around at all. In fact, Cervelo recommends riders looking to change up how their Rouvida handles go to a local bike shop.\n\nTo Cervelo's defense, they tell me that using a rear flip chip would mean they wouldn't be able to use a SRAM Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH), and they couldn't quite tailor the geometry how they wanted between road and gravel usage. Further, bringing the bike to the dealer means the dealer can change how the bike's motor responds. Swapping to the gravel geometry dropouts means also swapping to a profile tuned for gravel riding.\n\nWhile I am generally against anything that makes it harder for a home mechanic to work on a bike, I doubt the vast majority of cyclists actually use flip chips all that often anyway; they're likely going to use the bike as it was set up from the bike shop. I'd gladly take the ability to find a SRAM UDH at nearly any bike shop to being able to mess with a bike's geometry.\n\nThose replaceable dropouts mean the Rouvida can go back and forth between road and gravel uses. The geometry chart reveals a surprisingly quick trail figure both for road and gravel -- in the high 50s mm for the road setup, and low 60s mm for gravel across the board. But that's exactly what Cervelo was looking for.\n\nCalilung says that the Rouvida geometry came from a whole lot of testing. E-bike geometry can't just be a geometry copy and paste from another bike, if only because the mass of an e-bike system changes how a bike rides. Nonetheless, Cervelo essentially ended up with Caledonia geometry. That means you're getting fairly upright fit geometry but quick handling at low and medium speeds.\n\nThis makes the bike feel surprisingly maneuverable on gravel, but we'll dive into that later.\n\nComparing an e-bike of this ilk the competition isn't just about comparing how the frame rides, but also about the electronics.\n\nThe Fazua Ride 60 motor, battery, and system are roughly the same weight as other lightweight mid-drive systems like Bosch's Performance Line SX. It offers similar if not better top-end power when compared to other mid-power e-bike motors from Specialized and Bosch's Performance Line Sprint (SX) motor.\n\nThe key advantage that the Ride 60 motor offers over the competition is how simple the app makes tuning the motor. Rather than flooding the rider with a bevy of adjustment options, there's a simple Q&A to tune for power preferences, range preferences, and what kind of terrain you're riding the bike on. While most other motors on the market offer this level of adjustment, Fazua's questionnaire is remarkably easy to use\n\nAs far as bikes are concerned? The closest competition we've had for review includes the Specialized Turbo Creo, Trek Domane+ SLR, and the Ventum ES1-G (with a review to come). The Orbea is by far the lightest option, but it also doesn't quite have the power nor the Class 3 rating of the other bikes.\n\nThe Ventum ES1-G gravel e-bike offers plenty of power thanks to its Shimano EP8 mid-drive motor. It also features a Shimano Di2 electronic drivetrain that enables auto-shifting when you slow down, a standout feature in the segment. But while the Ventum offers great value for money, the ES1-G's aggressive fit geometry narrows the potential rider pool to folks who can tuck into a more aggressive position.\n\nThe Specialized Turbo Creo 2's motor feels similar to the Cervelo, but its focus on gravel riding means the Rouvida feels much more nimble while riding on the road. That's a positive for many folks, particularly if they're riding predominantly on dirt. Folks riding mostly on the road might be better suited to something that feels more nimble.\n\nAs for the Domane+? It comes closest in feel to the Rouvida, with similar tire clearance, a similar push toward mixing road and gravel capability, and a light-but-powerful TQ HPR-50 motor. The Domane+ SLR comes in at price points similar to the Cervelo as well. The choice might come down to what bike you might be able to get a better deal on.\n\nIn for review was the Cervelo Rouvida Force XPLR AXS 1. It features a set of Reserve 40 gravel wheels with Zipp ZR1 hubs, carbon gravel bars, a Rockshox Reverb AXS wireless dropper post, and WTB Vulpine 40 mm tires. The actual weight of my size small Rouvida with carbon wheels was 33.7 pounds (15.3 kg).\n\nRiding and testing were done in a range of situations, including road, gravel, and singletrack. The most illustrative ride I went on is below. Here, we started the ride at 100 percent charge and finished with roughly 40 percent, sticking predominantly to the Rouvida's middle 'River' assist level:\n\nCervelo doesn't quote range, but I found I could get about two hours of riding (roughly 40 miles/65 km) on rolling terrain in the maximum Boost setting. When I was more conservative with my assist usage, however, I was able to get closer to four hours' worth of riding (roughly 75 miles/120 km).\n\nIt's important to note that with nearly any gravel or road e-bike, the electric assist rarely will be designed to dominate how the bike rides. Rather than the shove and jolt one might experience from a more powerful system, the Fazua Ride 60 is much calmer. That's because the motor is rated to 250 W, with a max torque of 60 Nm. Those numbers are higher than the likes of the Fazua X20 one might find elsewhere, but it won't compare to the most powerful e-bikes out there.\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with that, of course. The Rouvida's drive system largely succeeds in feeling like a regular bike, just with a friendly helping of help. Some of these lightweight e-bike systems make you feel like you have a tailwind; the Fazua system feels as if you're riding with a tailwind while hitting the highest power numbers you've seen in 15 years.\n\nReally, the system is quite smooth. While you can feel something is going on as you pedal along seated, it's tough to tell the motor is helping as you go to stand out of the saddle. There's hardly a shove from the motor, just a steady stream of power that helps you ride along faster than you would on your own.\n\nLike most of these lightweight e-bike systems, power here from the torque and cadence sensors comes from a combination of speed and pedaling cadence. Loafing about results in minimal power, while pedaling at a high RPM results in the motor being more eager to give up all of its assist.\n\nOf course, all of this is adjustable through Fazua's own app. It's cleaner than just about any other system I've used in recent memory, with graphical charts showing how assist builds as the rider changes their pedaling input. Want the bike to use less energy in the lowest of its three settings? Simply slide the graph left and right to adjust how quickly the power comes on, and down to change its max power input. It felt quite intuitive in use.\n\nFolks who don't want to deal with graphs can fill out a simple questionnaire that tells the system how you expect to ride the bike, your fitness level, and more. I found this to be the best way to set up the system. The Rouvida felt good out of the box, but tailored to my riding style after using the app.\n\nTo note, the drive system is quieter than most systems, with only the slightest whir indicating to other riders that you're riding a bike with electric assist.\n\nReally, the rest of the bike is about as good as you'd want. The SRAM Force AXS drivetrain works wonderfully, with quick, precise, and low-effort shifting performance. Braking performance is also excellent, with levers that were highly adjustable for reach to different hand sizes. That the AXS shift buttons also control the Rockshox Reverb AXS dropper post is always a neat addition.\n\nOn that note, the Rockshox Reverb AXS dropper offers a slight bit of suspension when the seat post is partially lowered. The difference in how smooth the bike felt when seated was substantial. When fully extended, the Rouvida felt stiff and almost unforgiving. But when dropped ever so slightly? The bike was much smoother over any terrain where I was seated and pedaling.\n\nCervelo's carbon gravel handlebar leaves little to complain about, with a wide top area that gives a nice home for your palms. It doesn't particularly stand out, however; if there's a specific bar you prefer, swapping is straightforward. The same goes for the Selle Italia Model X Superflow saddle: perfectly serviceable, but not something that especially stands out.\n\nThe Reserve 40/44 wheels are quite good. The WTB Vulpine tires set up tubeless here without a compressor, and on the road, they feel stiff and responsive. And importantly, these wheels not only come with a lifetime rider warranty, but they also come with no rider weight limit. Can't ask for much more than that.\n\nDownsides? I wish the bike had the option for a 2x or a 1x drivetrain. While Cervelo says they tested 2x options, the bigger jumps that come with a 10-44T cassette as seen here are effectively negated by the extra power the bike provides.\n\nI felt the jumps between each gear were still a bit too big for riding with my local fast road ride, particularly because the motor is so sensitive to cadence changes. Riding on your own, or with a few friends though? There should be no problem.\n\nI appreciate that Fazua sought to add a USB-C plug to the bike. However, that plug is powerful enough to keep your phone from losing a charge while riding; it's not something I would rely upon for long rides.\n\nDespite my agreement with Cervelo that the vast majority of riders won't dither with their Rouvida's handling characteristics by swapping the interchangeable dropouts, I still wish this system was easier for the home mechanic.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint comes from sheer cost. All of that e-bike tech adds cost, but the Rouvida in this Force AXS spec is on the more expensive side of things. Add in a range extender that Cervelo hopes to have by the end of 2024 and prices go up even more. It's not like Cervelo has ever been a price leader in the market, I hope to see prices go down sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Cervelo Rouvida might be the brand's first e-bike, but it doesn't feel like it. It's a well-considered and polished overall package that doesn't seem to sacrifice anything. And as Cervelo hoped, the bike is very, very fun to ride in just about any situation.\n\nPlenty of bike manufacturers use one e-bike platform for both road builds and gravel builds. There's nothing wrong with that. But the Rouvida's trump card - its geometry-changing dropouts - allows the bike to truly shapeshift by changing its handling geometry. At least in this gravel build, the result is an e-bike that handles more like its non-electric bike siblings than nearly any other e-bike.\n\nThere's no getting around the cost of this bike, but the same can be said for a number of these high-end road and gravel e-bikes. If the cost isn't an issue, then it is harder to do better than the Cervelo Rouvida at the moment.", "source": {"uri": "velo.outsideonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Velo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alvin_holbrook@velo.outsideonline.com", "name": "Alvin Holbrook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fork end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerv\u00e9lo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cerv\u00e9lo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gravel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_bike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mountain bike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geometry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_(bicycle_part)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stem (bicycle part)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_bike_shop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local bike shop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_handlebar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle handlebar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Static random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailleur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derailleur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXS_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AXS (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garmin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_frame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle frame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbea", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimano", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shimano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zipp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRAM_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SRAM Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Human_Powered_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Human Powered Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Bikers", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Bikers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://velo-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Cervelo-Rouvida-review-04-1200x800.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550757", "eventUri": "eng-9550757", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The LCD display was refreshingly straightforward, giving me all the essential stats without any unnecessary frills -- speed, battery level, and pedal assist setting, all clear and readable.\n\nAn electric bike can be your trusty steed when navigating the urban jungle or embarking on a weekend adventure. But with so many options on the market, how do you choose the perfect e-bike? Fear not, dear reader, for we've got you covered with this comprehensive guide to selecting an electric bike that will make you the envy of the bike lane.\n\nFirst and foremost, consider your intended use. Are you a city slicker looking for a quick and efficient way to commute, or are you an adventurer seeking to explore the great outdoors? Different e-bikes cater to various needs, so it's essential to have a clear idea of how you plan to use your new ride.\n\nNext, examine the motor and battery specs. The motor's power, usually measured in watts, determines the level of assistance you'll receive while pedaling. A higher wattage generally means more power and faster acceleration. As for the battery, pay attention to its capacity (measured in watt-hours) and range. A larger capacity and more extended range mean more time on the road and less time tethered to an outlet.\n\nRemember to consider the bike's frame and components. Aluminum frames are lightweight and durable, while steel frames offer a more classic look and a smoother ride. The quality of the brakes, suspension, and gearing systems can significantly impact your riding experience, so choose components that match your needs and preferences.\n\nThink about the extras that matter to you. Do you need a bike with integrated lights for those early-morning or late-night rides? You may want a model with a built-in rack for hauling groceries or gear. Some e-bikes even have features like GPS tracking and smartphone integration, allowing you to stay connected and secure while on the go.\n\nOf course, budget is always a factor. E-bikes can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, so it's crucial to set a realistic budget and stick to it. Remember that while a higher price often means better quality and features, plenty of excellent options are available at more affordable prices.\n\nLastly, feel free to take a test ride. Nothing beats the hands-on experience of feeling the wind in your hair as you zip through the streets on a potential new e-bike. Many bike shops offer test rides, so take advantage of this opportunity to get a feel for different models and find the one that suits you best.\n\nConsidering your needs, preferences, and budget, you'll be well on your way to finding the perfect electric bike. Whether commuting to work, exploring new trails, or simply enjoying the freedom of the open road, an e-bike can be your ticket to a world of adventure and convenience. So go ahead, take the plunge, and discover the joy of riding with extra power beneath your pedals.", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike_lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bike lane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Range anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_(San_Francisco)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embarcadero (San Francisco)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Gate Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rack and pinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_pedal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle pedal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Mountain_Biking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Mountain Biking", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Choppers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Choppers", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Dirt_Bikes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Dirt Bikes", "wgt": 35}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/index1-663b8467b71b6.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550757", "eventUri": "eng-9550757", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

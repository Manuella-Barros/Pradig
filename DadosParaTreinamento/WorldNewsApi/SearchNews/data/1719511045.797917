White lost\u2014badly. This is probably because he was hard to take seriously as a candidate. White\u2019s campaign centered less on issues affecting Minnesota voters and more on incendiary comments about the Chinese Communist Party, women, and Jews. At the time, it prompted the obvious question: What happened to turn this erstwhile civil rights activist into MAGA podcaster? We published a long piece examining White\u2019s \u201ctinfoil hat populism.\u201d (To give a sense of White\u2019s tone, he called our reporter a \u201ccuck\u201d for doing that work; fun!) After this defeat, one might assume an end to White\u2019s political journey. Especially because, in many ways, his public image has somehow gotten worse. Earlier this week, the Daily Beast reported that White\u2019s 2022 campaign spent lavishly, including thousands at strip clubs. But, no quitter, White persisted. In an outsider campaign, he announced last year he would run for US Senate in 2024. This week\u2014somehow\u2014White won the endorsement of the Republican party to face Sen. Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota. White\u2019s endorsement perhaps shows the degree to which a new Republican party is emerging. Or, it could simply be a quirk of a weird election year. But, either way, you should go read Eamon\u2019s old piece outlining White\u2019s rise (perhaps descent is the better term) to MAGA candidate. There is one part that has always stuck with me from that piece. For it, Eamon talked with White\u2019s grandfather, Frank White, an elder statesman in the Minnesota sporting scene. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my grandson, but do I agree with his politics? No,\u201d White told us at the time. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Hey grandpa, I\u2019m going to be on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast.\u2019 I said, \u2018Do you know who Steve Bannon is, man?\u2019\u201d White continued: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can support my grandson supporting the GOP, and in essence, Trump. This is a guy who wants to be a dictator. Think about what that means. You\u2019re a person of color. Do you think you fit in his plans?\u201d", "summary": "In 2022, Royce White\u2014a former first-round NBA draft pick and George Floyd protest leader\u2014ran in the primary for Minnesota&#8217;s Fifth Congressional District as a far-right Republican and disciple of Steve Bannon.

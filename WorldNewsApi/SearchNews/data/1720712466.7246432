A statement by Air Vice Marshal Edward Gabkwet, Director of NAF Public Relations and Information, on Sunday said the strikes were conducted barely hours after the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Hasan Abubakar, conferred with Governor Alex Otti on the setting up of a Nigerian Air Force, NAF, Base in Abia State. According to Gabkwet, the illegal sites were located near Obiaku and in close proximity to the Imo/Abia/Rivers states borders. He said they consisted of two tanks and a reservoir in one location and three tanks and two reservoirs in another location along the Imo River bank. \u201cObserving that these sites were active, authorization was sought and received for air strikes on the targets. \u201cSubsequently, air strikes by the Air Component of Operation Delta Safe were conducted, which destroyed the 2 sites as well as the surface tanks and reservoirs. \u201cBuilding on these successes, air operations under Operation Delta Safe will be intensified especially within the areas of interest in efforts at curtailing the activities of criminal elements. \u201cThe successes recorded in destroying these IRS brings to fore the necessity of a NAF Base in Abia State, which Governor Otti and Air Marshal Abubakar both agreed was long overdue. \u201cThe NAF\u2019s continued efforts in all ongoing operations, yet again, underscore its commitment to maintaining aerial dominance over the Nigerian skies, while collaborating with surface forces towards the safety and security of Nigeria and its citizenry,\" he said.", "summary": "<img width=\"720\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NAF.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NAF.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NAF-300x249.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /><p>The Nigerian Air Force, NAF, has said that the Air Component of Operation Delta Safe, on Saturday destroyed two illegal refining sites, IRS, situated along the banks of Imo River.

He ended his international career in the format with the most runs of any player at Men's T20 World Cups (1,292 runs) between 2012 and 2024, in 33 innings across 35 matches.\n\nAfter delivering a match-winning knock for his team of 76 runs against South Africa in the final which led India to a seven-run victory, Kohli hung his boot from the T20I format ending his T20I career as India's second-highest run-scorer in the format, through 4188 runs in 125 games at an average of 48.69 and strike rate of 137.04.\n\nAs he stepped back from representing India in T20 internationals, it's a fine time to look back at some of his superlative performances in T20 World Cups.\n\n78 not out vs Pakistan, 2012\n\nIn a memorable match in Colombo during the Super Eights, Kohli scored an unbeaten 78 off 61 balls, forming a vital third-wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh to secure an eight-wicket win for India.

Chasing a target of 173, he hit 72 off 43 balls, including five fours and two sixes, steering India to the final.

With India needing 161 but teetering at 49/3, Kohli anchored the innings. As the chase reached a critical point, India required 39 from the final 18 balls.

India were losing...: Manjrekar's brutal 'strike rate' attack", "body": "Virat Kohli pulled off an MS Dhoni in the T20 World Cup final last week in Barbados. After struggling to find a rhythm in the first seven innings, where he scored just 75 runs to record his worst-ever show in a T20 World Cup edition, Kohli, just like Dhoni in the 2011 ODI World Cup, carved out a match-winning knock of a 59-ball 76 in the final against South Africa at the Kensington Oval to help India win by seven runs. However, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar wasn't quite happy with the knock, for which Kohli was given the Player of the Match award, as he re-ignited the 'strike rate' debate.\n\nDespite losing three wickets in the powerplay, India finished with 45 runs in the first six overs, where Kohli smashed four boundaries. However, India's recovery, owing to a 72-run stand for the fourth-wicket was single-handedly pulled off by Axar Patel, who hit 47 runs off 31 balls to propel India to 106 for four in the 14th over, a period where Kohli did not hit a single boundary.\n\nThe knock also allowed the next batter, Shivam Dube, to swing his bat freely, scoring a quickfire 16-ball 27 amid Kohli roaring back to hit a flurry of boundaries in the death over to help India set a 177-run target.\n\nSpeaking to ESPNCricinfo, Manjrekar reckoned that Kohli was bit too slow in his knock, which not only left Hardik Pandya, India's in-form middle-order batter, with just two balls to face, but also left the team in a precarious spot.\n\nBy playing that innings, Hardik Pandya, one of their most devastating batters, had just two balls to face. So I thought India's batting was good, but Virat Kohli had potentially played an innings that would've put India in a tight corner. And it almost proved to be that, before these guys' bowlers came in the end,\" Manjrekar said.\n\nThe former India batter reckoned that had it not been for the bowlers in the death overs, the Men in Blue would have lost the final against South Africa, who were almost in with 90 per cent chances of lifting their maiden world title in men's cricket after Heinrich Klaasen's 23-ball fifty.\n\nManjrekar, hence, feels that a bowler should have been adjudged as the Player of the Match, rather than Kohli, who only struck at 128 in the match.\n\n\"India were in a losing position, 90 percent winning chances (for South Africa). The complete turnaround actually saved Virat Kohli's innings because he played virtually half the innings with a strike-rate of 128. My Player of the Match would've been a bowler because they actually took the game from the jaws of defeat and won it for India,\" he added.\n\nIndia eventually won the final by just seven runs, winning their second T20 World Cup trophy and first in 17 years.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Manjrekar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Manjrekar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/07/02/1600x900/kohli_manjrekar_t20_wc_final_1719922325091_1719922340839.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Misbah-Ul-Haq believes Virat Kohli responded according to the situation.\n\nVirat Kohli hit a match-winning knock of 76 runs in the final to win the Player of the Match award in the end. India crushed South Africa by 7 runs to defend their 1st innings total of 176-6.\n\nNotably, the total looked a bit low at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, which is often dubbed as a high-scoring stadium. However, Rohit Sharma & Boys managed to steal victory with a marvelous job by pacers Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, and Hardik Pandya.\n\nNotably, Kohli took 59 balls to score 76 runs in the match, batting at a strike rate of 128+. He took 37 balls to reach his half-century and slammed 6 fours and 2 sixes during his knock. Some experts raised questions over his slow innings in the IND vs SA match.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: Shaheen Afridi publicly disrespects Mohsin Naqvi over his 'major surgery' remark on Team Pakistan\n\nCricketer-turned-commentator Misbah-Ul-Haq shared his views on Virat Kohli's slow knock in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. During a conversation on a Pakistan news channel, the former right-handed batsman said Kohli did the right thing according to the situation.\n\n\"One more thing I would like to say is that we are definitely saying that 37 balls is okay, fine. But, on the other hand, if he (Virat Kohli) had taken the chance and got out of the 37 balls, it was possible that India would have had to defend 150 or 140\", he said.\n\n\"So, the situation could have gone both ways because at that time they were standing on the edge and they could have gone in any direction\", he further added.\n\n\"They could have scored 170 or if they had gone in the direction of 190, it could have been 140. So, that was the risk which I think they understood better at that time and finally they managed to win this game\", the 50-year-old concluded.

Later, Kohli and Axar Patel added 76 and 47 respectively to take the scoreboard to a decent total of 176-7.\n\nSouth Africa dominated in the 2nd innings with the help of Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, who added 39 and 52. However, they failed to gear up when they needed 26 runs off the last three overs.\n\nJasprit Bumrah gave 2 runs in the 18th over, Arshdeep Singh gave 4 runs in the 19th over, and Hardik Pandya leaked just 8 runs in the 20th over to snatch the title for Team India.\n\nArshdeep Singh and Jasprit Bumrah picked 2 wickets each while Hardik Pandya captured a 3-wicket haul. Virat Kohli struggled to score half-centuries in any other match but came up with a crucial knock in the final to win the Player of the Match award.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misbah-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misbah-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/MisbahUlHaqandViratKohli.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Opening the innings for his side, Kohli scored 76 runs in 59 deliveries, helping India post a total of 176 runs on the board.\n\nHis performance also saw him receive the Player of the Match award in the post-match presentation ceremony.

He said that the batter stepped up for his team when it mattered the most.\n\nIndia batter Virat Kohli was at his best in the game against South Africa in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024. The batter came up with a stupendous effort with the bat when it mattered the most and made sure that he helped his team end the title drought and win the final to lift the second-ever T20 World Cup.\n\nComing into the final of the T20 World Cup 2024, Virat Kohli didn't have a great outing in the tournament. He failed in every game and had a lot of baggage on his back. Ahead of the final, the opening batter had just 75 runs to his name but in the big game, he turned the tables.\n\nOn a pitch, where batting seemed difficult, Virat Kohli stepped up big time for his team. He started the match aggressively as he hit three boundaries in the first over but after India lost early wickets, he realized the need to stay there on the pitch and played according to the situation.\n\nVirat Kohli held the one end and made sure he batted deep, taking his team to a winning total on the board. He anchored the innings perfectly and this allowed others around him to bat freely without caring about the wicket and get some runs quickly under their belt.\n\nVirat Kohli ended with a vital innings of 76 runs off 59 balls. He batted with a strike rate of around 130 and slammed 6 fours and 2 sixes in his innings. His effort with the bat powered India to a total of 176 runs on the board and won the game by 7 runs to lift their second T20 World Cup title. He also won Player of the Match for his innings.\n\nRicky Ponting while talking about Virat Kohli's innings recalled how there were questions over the batter's place in the team ahead of the team. He stressed that the pressure got more on Kohli following his failures but he always knew that India's batter would stand up on big occasions.\n\nRicky Ponting highlighted how Virat Kohli was under pressure as India lost three wickets and pointed out how he ended up playing the match-winning innings for the team. Speaking to ICC, he explained:\n\n\"There was a bit of talk around him even before the squad was picked. Whether Virat Kohli should be in this Indian squad. And then as the tournament's gone on, he hasn't made the runs he would have liked to have made. But you know, I've been asked 10 times maybe what do I think about it what do I think about his form and I just said look let him let him go when the big moments come around he'll stand up and sure enough he did today.\n\n\"And it was probably the most pressure he's been under as a player today as well considering they lost three early wickets and it was up to him to knuckle down and get the job done speaks volumes of him as being someone that can read the game understand the game but also being good enough to be able to do it, end up playing what turned out to be a match-winning knock for his team.\"\n\nRicky Ponting further highlighted how challenging it was for Virat Kohli as he had to work hard for his fifty, which was his slowest. He lauded the batter for assessing the conditions well and added:\n\n\"Yeah, it wasn't easy for him. I think the fifty that he brought up today was his slowest ever T20 international half-century. So that's how hard he had to work and then once he got to 50 he put the foot down.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Ponting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/RickyPontingViratKohli.jpeg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

There are some amazing players playing in India. I've no doubts they'll keep the flag waving high, and really take this team further from here now,' Player of the Match Kohli said after the final.\n\nAs he bids adieu, a look at Kohli's top 10 knocks in T20 Internationals:\n\n82 not out (53 balls) vs Pakistan, MCG, 2022\n\nArguably one of the greatest knocks in T20 cricket, Kohli's unbeaten 82 run knock powered India to a memorable victory against Pakistan at the MCG in the 2022 T20 World Cup.\n\nWith India in trouble on 31/4, chasing a target of 160, Kohli came up with a knock for the ages as he powered India to an sensational four wicket over Pakistan.\n\nKohli's 53-ball knock had four sixes and six fours, as he slammed all doubts about his strike rate in T20 cricket.\n\nJust when the match was looking like it was slipping from India's grasp, the batting great slammed two sixes off Haris Rauf's last over to seal one of the most famous wins against Pakistan in World Cups.\n\n76 (59 balls) vs South Africa, Barbados, 2024\n\nKohli signed off in great style with a match-winning knock in the 2024 T20 World Cup final.\n\nStruggling for runs in the earlier games, Kohli saved his best for the last as he hit 76 off 59, and was named Player of the Match as India won the T20 World Cup by seven runs.\n\nHe took his time to get going, hitting 50 from 48 balls as questions again arose about his conservative approach in the middle overs, but he made up for it at the end, hitting 26 runs from the last 11 balls, with two sixes and as many fours.\n\n82 not out (51 balls) vs Australia, Mohali, 2016\n\nKohli, the master of run chases, guided India home during the T20 World Cup Super 10 match against Australia in Mohali\n\nSet to score 161, India found themselves in trouble on 49/3 before Kohli came to the rescue. He got very little support from the other end as wickets fell from the other end at regular intervals.\n\nWith 39 needed from the last three overs, Kohli went on the rampage, hitting 32 off 11 to take India to victory with five balls to spare.\n\n78 not out (61 balls) vs Pakistan, Colombo, 2012\n\nA young Virat set the stage on fire as he starred with a match-winning knock on a difficult pitch.\n\nAfter Pakistan were bowled out for a below-par 128, India suffered an early blow when Gautam Gambhir was dismissed for a duck in the first over.\n\nKohli got things back in track for India as he dominated the 75-run second wicket stand with the experienced Virender Sehwag, who was making a comeback.\n\nHe hit nine boundaries and two sixes to take the team home in the high-voltage contest watched by a capacity crowd.\n\nKohli started with an outside edge off Raza Hasan for a boundary but then played some lovely strokes.\n\nA back foot cover drive off Saeed Ajmal and lovely cover drive off Yasir Arafat were glorious strokes. He also lofted Shahid Afridi over long off for a six.\n\nWhether driving on the up or playing off his hips, Kohli was a treat to watch.\n\n72 not out (44 balls) vs South Africa, Mirpur, 2014\n\nKohli showed his class in another tough run chase against a tough South African bowling attack.\n\nAfter South Africa had piled on 172/4, India were able to coast to victory in the final over courtesy of Kohli, who single-handedly took the Proteas bowlers to the cleaners.\n\nHe looked in complete control from the outset, smashing his way to 72 from 43 balls, including five fours and two sixes, to steer India through to the final.\n\n94 not out (50 balls) vs West Indies, Hyderabad, 2019\n\nThe West Indies suffered at the hands of Kohli, who blazed his way to 94 from 50 balls in the first T20 International in Hyderabad.\n\nWest Indies had amassed a huge 207/5 on a flat wicket and India, despite losing Rohit Sharma early, started strongly as Kohli and K L Rahul (62 from 40 balls) put on 100 runs for the second wicket from 61 balls.\n\nKohli struggled at the start, scoring run-a-ball 20 before an angry exchange with West Indies pacer Kesrick Williams saw him turn things around.\n\nHe raced to his fifty from 35 balls, before he smashed 44 from the next 15 balls to finish not out on 94 -- his highest T20I score then as India won by six wickets with eight balls remaining.\n\n70 (29 balls) vs West Indies, Mumbai, 2019\n\nA few days later, Kohli again proved to be unstoppable with the bat against the West Indies.\n\nAfter Rahul (91 off 56) and Rohit (71 off 34) had given India a smashing start, Kohli provided the flourish at the end, with an entertaining 70 not out off just 29 balls, with four fours and seven sixes at a strike rate of 241.\n\nHe also registered his fastest fifty in T20 Internationals as he got the landmark from just 21 balls to power India to 240/3. They won by 67 runs as the West Indies finished on 173/8.\n\n90 (55) vs Australia, Adelaide, January 2016\n\nKohli played a blinder, smashing his way to a brilliant 90 not out from 55 balls to lift India to a huge 188/3 in the first T20 International against Australia.\n\nAfter Openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma perished in the Powerplay, Kohli got back India on track as he put on 134 runs for the third wicket with Suresh Raina.\n\nKohli was in complete control in the middle overs, finding the gaps at will to stroke nine fours and two sixes.\n\nAustralia could only muster 151 to lose by 37 runs.\n\n80 from 52 balls vs England, Ahmedabad, 2021\n\nKohli returned to open the innings for India in T20 cricket after a few years and made an immediate during the series-deciding fifth and final T20 International against England in Ahmedabad on March 20, 2021.\n\nPromoted to open the innings with Rohit after Rahul struggled for runs, Kohli, who had lost opened the batting in T20 International in 2018, made most of the opportunity as he blazed his way to 80 not out from 52 balls, with seven fours and two sixes.\n\nHis 94-run opening stand with Rohit from 54 balls had set the platform as India piled on a massive 224/2 in their 20 overs.\n\nIn reply, England finished on 188/8 to lose by 36 runs as India clinched the series 3-2.\n\nThat innings was a major turning point for Kohli's T20 career.\n\nSpurred on by his good showing in the Ahmedabad match, Kohli switched to opening for RCB from IPL 2021 onwards and has been piling tons of runs every IPL season.\n\n122 not out vs Afghanistan, Dubai, September 2022\n\nKohli ended the long wait for a hundred in international cricket as he reached the elusive three-figure mark after 1021 days to set up India's massive 101-run win over Afghanistan in the Asia Cup.\n\nKohli struck a high-quality 122 not out off 61 balls for his 71st international hundred to take India to 212/2.\n\nHis unbeaten effort off 61 balls got him his first hundred since November 2019 and his 71st overall, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of international centuries. He is now only behind Sachin Tendulkar in the all-time list.\n\nThis was also Kohli's maiden ton in T20 Internationals -- only the fourth Indian to achieve the feat of hitting a hundred in all three formats in international cricket.\n\nPhotographs: BCCI/X, Reuters", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri":

Michael Vaughan comes up with a huge statement", "body": "Former England cricketer Michael Vaughan opened up about the innings of Virat Kohli in the final of the T20 World 2024. He lauded the batter for his innings in the summit clash and said that the batter played an innings that his team needed.\n\nAfter failing in the entire tournament, Virat Kohli stepped up for his team in the most crucial game of the T20 World Cup 2024. The senior batter rose to the occasion and played a fighting innings for his team in the final against South Africa, which took place at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown Barbados.\n\nComing into the T20 World Cup 2024 final, Virat Kohli just had 75 runs under his belt. But when the chips were down, he proved his worth and made sure that he stood tall for his team. After India lost early wickets, the batter steadied the innings and made sure that he batted deep.\n\nVirat Kohli started aggressively as he hit three boundaries in the first over but after that, he took a back foot. He anchored the innings perfectly and it allowed others around him to bat freely and play aggressively, helping the team post big totals.\n\nVirat Kohli played an innings of 76 runs off 59 balls. He batted with a strike rate of around 130 and slammed 6 fours and 2 sixes in his innings. His knock helped India post a total of 176 runs on the board and they won the game by 7 runs to lift their second T20 World Cup title. He also won Player of the Match for his innings.\n\nFollowing his innings, Virat Kohli had faced a bit of criticism as well. Many fans and pundits believe that the batter played the slow innings and it could've cost India as well.\n\nBut Michael Vaughan believes that Virat Kohli played a very good innings and India needed a rock that time with wickets falling. He stressed the fact that someone needed to hold the end as it looked like India would manage just 150. Speaking on a podcast, he stated:\n\n\"Yes, very good play. Nicely did Virat. He did. Virat played the innings his team needed on that day. They needed a little bit of a rock. Someone to hang in there. They were falling at the other end. It looked like at one stage they were going to get 150.\"\n\nMichael Vaughan further talked about Virat Kohli's innings in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024. He stressed that the batter managed to hang in there and got a decent total. He also was in awe of the way the game panned out.

The word 'CHAMPIONS' was written on the jersey in bold letters.\n\nThe squad members, support staff, their families and media were stuck in Barbados, which was hit by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThe flight was organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah and departed on July 2 before arriving in Delhi at around 6 am on Thursday morning. Board officials and members of the media contingent were also on the flight.\n\nFrom the airport, Team India reached the ITC Maurya hotel, where they stayed before their meeting with PM Modi.\n\nA special cake featuring the T20 World Cup trophy was cut at the hotel to celebrate the win. Rohit, Virat, Dravid and all-rounder Hardik Pandya were among the stars who took part in the cake-cutting. The cake featured the trophy and some pictures of Indian stars.\n\nMuch like other teams do after winning titles, the Rohit-led side will have an open-top bus ride in Mumbai at Marine Drive and the iconic Wankhede Stadium from 5 pm.\n\nIndia ended a 13-year ICC World Cup trophy drought with victory in the final, defeating South Africa by seven runs on Saturday. Virat Kohli's 76 helped India reach 176/7 while Hardik Pandya (3/20) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/18) helped India restrict Proteas to 169/8 despite Heinrich Klaasen's 52 in just 27 balls. Bumrah, who got 15 scalps throughout the tournament at a stunning economy rate of 4.17, got the 'Player of the Tournament' honours.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Heading into the final, the 35-year-old had not been in the best of forms, having scored just 75 runs in the first seven matches.\n\nHowever, opening the innings for the first time in the tournament's history, Kohli rose to the occasion when the team needed him most. With India reeling at 34/3 in 4.3 overs, Kohli performed at his vintage best, guiding the team to a competitive total of 176/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nSouth Africa, in reply, appeared to be cruising towards victory, needing just 30 runs off the last five overs. However, the Indian seamers turned the game on its head with their tight bowling, ultimately securing a seven-run victory and clinching their second T20 World Cup trophy.\n\nThe celebrations will be continued with a special meet-up scheduled with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 11 am on Thursday. Following the meeting, the team will depart for Mumbai, where BCCI has arranged a 1 km victory parade from Nariman Point to Wankhede for fans to get an up-close glimpse of their stars with the World Cup trophy.\n\nAfterwards, the winning team will also be felicitated at the iconic Wankhede Stadium.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Hotels", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITC Hotels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Point", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Point"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nariman Point"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/202407043183549.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.615686274509804, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

We always wanted to win a World Cup. Bringing the trophy back to Wankhede is a very special feeling. We have been playing for the last 15 years and this is the first time, I've seen Rohit so emotional - he was crying, I was crying, a hug between both of us - I will never forget that day,\" Kohli said.\n\nAfter the victory both the senior players announced their retirement from the T20 format of the game. \"I couldn't connect with the emotions of the seniors, who cried that night (after the 2011 World Cup triumph) but now I do,\" Kohli said. The 35-year-old was also part of winning the ODI World Cup team in 2011 where he was one of the younger players coming up the ranks amongst seniors.\n\nJasprit Bumrah delivered a stellar performance throughout the World Cup, showcasing his mastery with 15 crucial wickets at an impressive economy rate of 4.17. His outstanding contributions earned him the well-deserved Player of the Tournament award. Kohli would go on to say Bumrah should be considered as the eighth wonder of the world. \"I'll sign the petition for Jasprit Bumrah to be the eighth wonder of the world right now.

The score turned out to be a winning one as India restricted South Africa to 169/8 and won the game by 7 runs.\n\nWith Kohli delivering on the big stage once again, Irfan Pathan has hailed him as the player in the Indian team who controls the big games.

He finished his T20I career with 4188 runs in 125 matches.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-19_Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Under-19 Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Hotels", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITC Hotels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/virat-kohlis-family-members-arrive-at-itc-maurya-hotel-in-delhi-2024-07-26b8399b2045ae7f97ccb1cd1f181165-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 72, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 910, "textEnd": 916}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Kohli, who was adjudged Player of the Match in the final for his match-winning knock of 76 off 59 balls, had much to celebrate. Heading into the final, the 35-year-old had not been in the best of forms, having scored just 75 runs in the first seven matches.\n\nHowever, opening the innings for the first time in the tournament's history, Kohli rose to the occasion when the team needed him most. With India reeling at 34/3 in 4.3 overs, Kohli performed at his vintage best, guiding the team to a competitive total of 176/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nSouth Africa, in reply, appeared to be cruising towards victory, needing just 30 runs off the last five overs. However, the Indian seamers turned the game on its head with their tight bowling, ultimately securing a seven-run victory and clinching their second T20 World Cup trophy.

It should be noted here that the Indian team reached New Delhi in the early hours of Thursday morning after an 18-hour-long flight from Barbados. Ever since the news of their landing came out, the fans turned up at the airport in huge numbers to give the Indian team an arousing reception for their historic triumph.\n\nKohli was one of the first players to have left the airport and boarded the team bus and that's why the fans got excited after seeing him. The star batter also waved back and was also seen smiling.\n\nVirat Kohli opened the innings for India along with skipper Rohit Sharma for the first time in a T20 World Cup and was seen struggling facing bowlers right from the first match. But when the team needed him to step up in the summit clash as the team suffered a batting collapse and were reeling at 34/3 in 4.3 overs, Kohli bounced back and showed signs of his old self and helped the tea post a respectable target of 176 runs while batting first.\n\nDuring the second innings, at one point the Aiden Markram-led side needed just 30 runs to win off as many balls. At the same time, it was the Indian seamers, who rose to the occasion and helped the team bounce back by bowling brilliantly won the match by seven runs, and went on to lift their second T20 World Cup title.\n\nThe Rohit Sharma-led side has reached the ITC Maurya Hotel in Delhi and will be meeting the honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 11:00 a.m. After that, they would head to Mumbai, where they would attend a special roadshow along with the fans and the World Cup trophy in the evening.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Hotels", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITC Hotels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/07/04/article/image/virat kohli-1720063155753.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 188}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Thirteen summers ago, as a young 22-year-old, he carried Sachin Tendulkar on his shoulders to celebrate India's historic ODI World Cup win.\n\nBut when he returned to the iconic venue on Thursday evening - this time as a seasoned, just-retired T20I cricketer - Kohli could not control his emotions as he addressed the crowd to celebrate India's T20 World Cup victory.\n\n\"When we won the World Cup back in 2011, I could not connect with the emotions of the senior players at that point of time. I could not understand why they were crying.\n\n\"For me, it felt like, 'yeah, we have won the World Cup and that was a fact'. I was 22, but now, it's a different feeling,\" Kohli said as a packed stadium chanted his name.\n\nHaving captained India for long, Kohli, by his own admission, now understands what it feels to clinch an world title - battling odds, overcoming disappointments.\n\n\"Now being at this position, (I understand what it means). Not just me, Rohit has played for so long, and we both have been trying hard for this for so long.\n\n\"When I was the captain, he was a senior player; now he is the captain, I am a senior player, and our only aim was to win India a World Cup,\" Kohli said.\n\nOvercoming a rather disappointing campaign in the just-concluded T20 event, Kohli's gritty innings in the final paved the way for India. And, as India pulled off a win from the jaws of defeat, it was an emotional moment for both Rohit and Kohli.\n\nHaving played together for 15 years, this was the first time Kohli saw Rohit so emotional on the field. \"When I was walking up the steps, we both were crying.\n\n\"For me, that's a very special memory from that day,\" Kohli said, reflecting on the state of mind after the big game. \"The only goal is Indian cricket and the Indian flag. That's what we take pride in,\" he added.\n\nAs he walked down the memory lane, the cricket-crazy fans of Mumbai gave him a standing ovation and Kohli, too, hailed Wankhede Stadium as a 'special one'.\n\n\"No better to come back (and celebrate) than Wankhede. The last time we were here, it was a special feeling and it is a very special stadium and I absolutely love playing here and love the crowd as well,\" he signed off.\n\nLatest on SportstarOur only aim was to win India a World Cup, says an emotional Kohli at WankhedeShayan AcharyaWhy is there no extra-time in quarterfinal or semifinal of Copa America 2024?Team SportstarIND-W vs SA-W: Good to have Chloe Tryon back, says Wolvaardt ahead of T20I series openerLavanya Lakshmi NarayananParis 2024: Jisna Mathew not in Olympic relay team as she is not a national camper, explains AFIStan RayanWimbledon 2024: Novak Djokovic survives spirited challenge from British wildcard Jacob Fearnley ReutersREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Tryon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Tryon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3ea2v5/article68368338.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-07-04%20at%2022.45.06_546ec2f1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9700350", "eventUri": "eng-9700350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Kohli described how, in their decade and a half of association, he had never seen Rohit so emotional until they hugged with welled-up eyes after the victory.\n\n\"This is the first time in 15 years that I have seen Rohit show so much emotion. When we were climbing those steps (at Kensington Oval), he was crying, and I was crying,\" Kohli recounted to the audience, adding a deeply personal touch to the celebrations that followed the memorable open bus victory parade.\n\nReflecting on the significance of the moment, Kohli recalled the 2011 World Cup when, at 21, he and his teammates carried Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulders, acknowledging the maestro's burden of carrying Indian cricket for 21 years.

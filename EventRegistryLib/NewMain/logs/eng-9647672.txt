He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nGoldschmidt served one term as governor, from 1987 to 1991. Before that, he was mayor of Portland, and he served as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nHe was one of Oregon's most respected public figures, credited with making Portland one of the country's most livable cities. His decision not to seek a second term as governor left many Oregonians wondering why.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was Portland mayor, he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl who was the daughter of a woman who had worked for him.\n\nUnder Oregon law, Goldschmidt's relationship with the girl would have been considered statutory rape because of her age. Goldschmidt escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt made his confession to The Oregonian as the Willamette Week newspaper was preparing to publish an article revealing the relationship with the girl.\n\nIn that confession, Goldschmidt claimed the relationship lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years, and the woman told newspapers in interviews that were published after her death in 2011 that it continued for more than a decade.\n\nBecause of Goldschmidt's golden-boy image, his admission was a blockbuster. Questions were raised about who else knew his secret, and whether anyone helped him cover it up over the years.\n\nThe scandal occurred months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric.\n\nGoldschmidt agreed to take on the higher education job at the bidding of Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a fellow Democrat.\n\nAs governor from 1987 to 1991, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming the state's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nBut in 1990, Goldschmidt stunned Oregon by announcing that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wasn't running for a second term.\n\n\"It will require giving more of myself than I am prepared to give,\" he said at the time. He never sought elected office again.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\n\"He was like a machine gun,\" Hatfield once told The Oregonian. \"He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.\"\n\nA legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971. Then, at 32, Goldschmidt became the youngest mayor of a major American city.\n\nThe fuzzy-haired, sideburned Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland's widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.\n\nPortland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first -- and only -- NBA championship in 1977.\n\nGoldschmidt remained as mayor until 1979, when he was named transportation secretary by Carter, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp.\n\nAfter Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for Nike.\n\nIn 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor's race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state's closest gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state's continuing economic distress and high unemployment. Goldschmidt, buoyed by support from businessmen and his own business experience, won with 52% of the vote. Analysts attributed his victory to his economic program and to his record of cutting crime as mayor of Portland.\n\nIn office, Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many state residents feared growth.\n\nHe also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nHis governorship didn't win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy. He was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.\n\nAn independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.\n\nAfter leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.\n\n-- -\n\nThe late Associated Press reporter Steven DuBois contributed to this obituary.

Neil Goldschmidt is shown during an interview with the Oregonian newspaper, Thursday, May 6. 2004, in Portland, Ore. Goldschmidt, a former Oregon governor whose confession that he had sex with a 14-year-old girl in the 1970s blackened what had been a nearly sterling reputation, has died. He was 83. (Michael [...]\n\nFormer Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, who as mayor of Portland was credited with starting the city on its path to becoming a magnet for the young, hip and liberal but whose reputation unraveled after it was revealed he had a yearslong affair with an aide's teenage daughter, has died. He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the cause was heart failure.\n\nBetween converting a busy highway into a popular riverfront park and developing the seeds of a robust public transit system, Portland's fuzzy-haired, sideburned mayor had a secret double life. For years in the 1970s, he engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with the teenage daughter of an aide.\n\nAt 32, Goldschmidt was elected the youngest mayor of a major American city in 1972. Seven years later, he left City Hall to become President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary. He served one term as Oregon governor, from 1987 to 1991.\n\nGoldschmidt announced in 1990 that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wouldn't seek a second term, saying, \"It will require more of myself than I am prepared to give.\" He never sought elected office again. The decision by one of Oregon's most revered politicians was shocking, and left many wondering why he'd walk away from a career on the rise.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was mayor, he had a sexual relationship that began when the girl was 14. Under Oregon law at the time, the sexual encounters would have been considered statutory rape because of the girl's age, but he escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt confessed to The Oregonian as the rival Willamette Week was preparing to publish an article revealing the abuse. He claimed the relationship -- which he called an \"affair\" -- lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years. In interviews that were published after her death in 2011, the woman told newspapers that it actually continued for more than a decade and contributed to a tragic life of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nThe abuse was revealed months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric.

He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nGoldschmidt served one term as governor, from 1987 to 1991. Before that, he was mayor of Portland, and he served as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nHe was one of Oregon's most respected public figures, credited with making Portland one of the country's most livable cities. His decision not to seek a second term as governor left many Oregonians wondering why.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was Portland mayor, he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl who was the daughter of a woman who had worked for him.\n\nUnder Oregon law, Goldschmidt's relationship with the girl would have been considered statutory rape because of her age. Goldschmidt escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt made his confession to The Oregonian as the Willamette Week newspaper was preparing to publish an article revealing the relationship with the girl.\n\nIn that confession, Goldschmidt claimed the relationship lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years, and the woman told newspapers in interviews that were published after her death in 2011 that it continued for more than a decade.\n\nBecause of Goldschmidt's golden-boy image, his admission was a blockbuster. Questions were raised about who else knew his secret, and whether anyone helped him cover it up over the years.\n\nThe scandal occurred months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric.\n\nGoldschmidt agreed to take on the higher education job at the bidding of Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a fellow Democrat.\n\nAs governor from 1987 to 1991, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming the state's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nBut in 1990, Goldschmidt stunned Oregon by announcing that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wasn't running for a second term.\n\n\"It will require giving more of myself than I am prepared to give,\" he said at the time. He never sought elected office again.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\n\"He was like a machine gun,\" Hatfield once told The Oregonian. \"He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.\"\n\nA legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971. Then, at 32, Goldschmidt became the youngest mayor of a major American city.\n\nThe fuzzy-haired, sideburned Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland's widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.\n\nPortland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first -- and only -- NBA championship in 1977.\n\nGoldschmidt remained as mayor until 1979, when he was named transportation secretary by Carter, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp.\n\nAfter Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for Nike.\n\nIn 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor's race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state's closest gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state's continuing economic distress and high unemployment. Goldschmidt, buoyed by support from businessmen and his own business experience, won with 52% of the vote. Analysts attributed his victory to his economic program and to his record of cutting crime as mayor of Portland.\n\nIn office, Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many state residents feared growth.\n\nHe also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nHis governorship didn't win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy. He was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.\n\nAn independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.\n\nAfter leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.\n\n-- -\n\nThe late Associated Press reporter Steven DuBois contributed to this obituary.

Neil Goldschmidt, left, announces that Enron and Portland General Electric have signed an agreement under which Oregon Electric Utility Company will acquire PGE from Enron on Nov. 18, 2003, in Portland, Ore. Goldschmidt, a former Oregon governor whose confession that he had sex with a 14-year-old girl in the 1970s blackened what had been a nearly sterling reputation, has died. He was 83.\n\nNeil Goldschmidt, a former Oregon governor whose confession that he had sex with a 14-year-old girl in the 1970s blackened what had been a nearly sterling reputation, has died. He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nGoldschmidt served one term as governor, from 1987 to 1991. Before that, he was mayor of Portland, and he served as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nHe was one of Oregon's most respected public figures, credited with making Portland one of the country's most livable cities. His decision not to seek a second term as governor left many Oregonians wondering why.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was Portland mayor, he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl who was the daughter of a woman who had worked for him.\n\nUnder Oregon law, Goldschmidt's relationship with the girl would have been considered statutory rape because of her age. Goldschmidt escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt made his confession to The Oregonian as the Willamette Week newspaper was preparing to publish an article revealing the relationship with the girl.\n\nIn that confession, Goldschmidt claimed the relationship lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years, and the woman told newspapers in interviews that were published after her death in 2011 that it continued for more than a decade.\n\nBecause of Goldschmidt's golden-boy image, his admission was a blockbuster. Questions were raised about who else knew his secret, and whether anyone helped him cover it up over the years.\n\nThe scandal occurred months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric.\n\nGoldschmidt agreed to take on the higher education job at the bidding of Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a fellow Democrat.\n\nAs governor from 1987 to 1991, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming the state's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nBut in 1990, Goldschmidt stunned Oregon by announcing that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wasn't running for a second term.\n\n\"It will require giving more of myself than I am prepared to give,\" he said at the time. He never sought elected office again.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\n\"He was like a machine gun,\" Hatfield once told The Oregonian. \"He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.\"\n\nA legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971. Then, at 32, Goldschmidt became the youngest mayor of a major American city.\n\nThe fuzzy-haired, sideburned Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland's widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.\n\nPortland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first -- and only -- NBA championship in 1977.\n\nGoldschmidt remained as mayor until 1979, when he was named transportation secretary by Carter, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp.\n\nAfter Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for Nike.\n\nIn 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor's race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state's closest gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state's continuing economic distress and high unemployment. Goldschmidt, buoyed by support from businessmen and his own business experience, won with 52% of the vote. Analysts attributed his victory to his economic program and to his record of cutting crime as mayor of Portland.\n\nIn office, Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many state residents feared growth.\n\nHe also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nHis governorship didn't win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy. He was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.\n\nAn independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.\n\nAfter leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.\n\n-- -\n\nThe late Associated Press reporter Steven DuBois contributed to this obituary.

He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nGoldschmidt served one term as governor, from 1987 to 1991. Before that, he was mayor of Portland, and he served as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nHe was one of Oregon's most respected public figures, credited with making Portland one of the country's most livable cities. His decision not to seek a second term as governor left many Oregonians wondering why.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was Portland mayor, he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl who was the daughter of a woman who had worked for him.\n\nUnder Oregon law, Goldschmidt's relationship with the girl would have been considered statutory rape because of her age. Goldschmidt escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nFILE - Former Oregon Gov.

(Michael Lloyd/The Oregonian via AP)\n\nGoldschmidt made his confession to The Oregonian as the Willamette Week newspaper was preparing to publish an article revealing the relationship with the girl.\n\nIn that confession, Goldschmidt claimed the relationship lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years, and the woman told newspapers in interviews that were published after her death in 2011 that it continued for more than a decade.\n\nBecause of Goldschmidt's golden-boy image, his admission was a blockbuster. Questions were raised about who else knew his secret, and whether anyone helped him cover it up over the years.\n\nThe scandal occurred months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric.\n\nGoldschmidt agreed to take on the higher education job at the bidding of Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a fellow Democrat.\n\nAs governor from 1987 to 1991, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming the state's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nBut in 1990, Goldschmidt stunned Oregon by announcing that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wasn't running for a second term.\n\n\"It will require giving more of myself than I am prepared to give,\" he said at the time. He never sought elected office again.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt\u00b4s portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\n\"He was like a machine gun,\" Hatfield once told The Oregonian. \"He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.\"\n\nA legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971. Then, at 32, Goldschmidt became the youngest mayor of a major American city.\n\nThe fuzzy-haired, sideburned Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland's widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.\n\nPortland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first - and only - NBA championship in 1977.\n\nGoldschmidt remained as mayor until 1979, when he was named transportation secretary by Carter, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp.\n\nAfter Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for Nike.\n\nIn 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor's race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state's closest gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state's continuing economic distress and high unemployment. Goldschmidt, buoyed by support from businessmen and his own business experience, won with 52% of the vote. Analysts attributed his victory to his economic program and to his record of cutting crime as mayor of Portland.\n\nIn office, Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many state residents feared growth.\n\nHe also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nHis governorship didn't win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy. He was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.\n\nAn independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.\n\nAfter leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.\n\n--\n\nThe late Associated Press reporter Steven DuBois contributed to this obituary.

Neil Goldschmidt, who as mayor of Portland was credited with starting the city on its path to becoming a magnet for the young, hip and liberal but whose reputation unraveled after it was revealed he had a yearslong affair with an aide's teenage daughter, has died. He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the cause was heart failure.\n\nBetween converting a busy highway into a popular riverfront park and developing the seeds of a robust public transit system, Portland's fuzzy-haired, sideburned mayor had a secret double life. For years in the 1970s, he engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with the teenage daughter of an aide.\n\nAt 32, Goldschmidt was elected the youngest mayor of a major American city in 1972. Seven years later, he left City Hall to become President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary. He served one term as Oregon governor, from 1987 to 1991.\n\nGoldschmidt announced in 1990 that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wouldn't seek a second term, saying, \"It will require more of myself than I am prepared to give.\" He never sought elected office again.

He claimed the relationship -- which he called an \"affair\" -- lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years. In interviews that were published after her death in 2011, the woman told newspapers that it actually continued for more than a decade and contributed to a tragic life of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nThe abuse was revealed months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric. He retreated from public life.\n\n\"In the 35 years since I failed this young woman, her family, and my family, the pain has never eased,\" Goldschmidt told The Oregonian in an email after the victim died in 2011.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library.

He was 83.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nGoldschmidt served one term as governor, from 1987 to 1991. Before that, he was mayor of Portland, and he served as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nHe was one of Oregon's most respected public figures, credited with making Portland one of the country's most livable cities. His decision not to seek a second term as governor left many Oregonians wondering why.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was Portland mayor, he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl who was the daughter of a woman who had worked for him.\n\nUnder Oregon law, Goldschmidt's relationship with the girl would have been considered statutory rape because of her age. Goldschmidt escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt made his confession to The Oregonian as the Willamette Week newspaper was preparing to publish an article revealing the relationship with the girl.\n\nIn that confession, Goldschmidt claimed the relationship lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years, and the woman told newspapers in interviews that were published after her death in 2011 that it continued for more than a decade.\n\nBecause of Goldschmidt's golden-boy image, his admission was a blockbuster. Questions were raised about who else knew his secret, and whether anyone helped him cover it up over the years.\n\nThe scandal occurred months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric.\n\nGoldschmidt agreed to take on the higher education job at the bidding of Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a fellow Democrat.\n\nAs governor from 1987 to 1991, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming the state's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nBut in 1990, Goldschmidt stunned Oregon by announcing that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wasn't running for a second term.\n\n\"It will require giving more of myself than I am prepared to give,\" he said at the time. He never sought elected office again.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\n\"He was like a machine gun,\" Hatfield once told The Oregonian. \"He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.\"\n\nA legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971. Then, at 32, Goldschmidt became the youngest mayor of a major American city.\n\nThe fuzzy-haired, sideburned Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland's widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.\n\nPortland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first -- and only -- NBA championship in 1977.\n\nGoldschmidt remained as mayor until 1979, when he was named transportation secretary by Carter, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp.\n\nAfter Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for Nike.\n\nIn 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor's race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state's closest gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state's continuing economic distress and high unemployment. Goldschmidt, buoyed by support from businessmen and his own business experience, won with 52% of the vote. Analysts attributed his victory to his economic program and to his record of cutting crime as mayor of Portland.\n\nIn office, Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many state residents feared growth.\n\nHe also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nHis governorship didn't win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy. He was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.\n\nAn independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.\n\nAfter leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.\n\n-- -\n\nThe late Associated Press reporter Steven DuBois contributed to this obituary.

For years in the 1970s, he engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with the teenage daughter of an aide.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. He was 83.\n\nThe newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nAt 32, Goldschmidt was elected the youngest mayor of a major American city in 1972.

The decision by one of Oregon's most revered politicians was shocking, and left many wondering why he'd walk away from a career on the rise.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was mayor, he had a sexual relationship that began when the girl was 14. Under Oregon law at the time, the sexual encounters would have been considered statutory rape because of the girl's age, but he escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt confessed to The Oregonian as the rival Willamette Week was preparing to publish an article revealing the abuse. He claimed the relationship -- which he called an \"affair\" -- lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years. In interviews that were published after her death in 2011, the woman told newspapers that it actually continued for more than a decade and contributed to a tragic life of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nThe abuse was revealed months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric. He retreated from public life.\n\n\"In the 35 years since I failed this young woman, her family, and my family, the pain has never eased,\" Goldschmidt told The Oregonian in an email after the victim died in 2011.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nThe scandal reverberated among Oregon's political elite, where rumors circulated about who knew Goldschmidt's secret and kept it quiet.\n\nAs governor, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming Oregon's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\n\"He was like a machine gun,\" Hatfield once told The Oregonian. \"He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.\"\n\nA legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971 and was elected mayor the following year.\n\nThe fuzzy-haired, sideburned Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland's widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.\n\nPortland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first -- and only -- NBA championship in 1977.\n\nHe left in 1979 to run the U.S. Department of Transportation, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp. After Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for athletic apparel giant Nike, Inc.\n\nIn 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor's race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state's closest gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state's continuing economic distress and high unemployment.

The image was stolen on March 27, 2019.\n\nNeil Goldschmidt was credited with starting Portland on its path to becoming a magnet for the young, hip and liberal before becoming a U.S. cabinet secretary and Oregon's governor.\n\nBut between converting a busy highway into a popular riverfront park and developing the seeds of a robust public transit system, Portland's fuzzy-haired, sideburned mayor had a secret double life. For years in the 1970s, he engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with the teenage daughter of an aide.\n\nGoldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. He was 83.\n\nThe newspaper said the reported cause was heart failure.\n\nAt 32, Goldschmidt was elected the youngest mayor of a major American city in 1972. Seven years later, he left City Hall to become President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary. He served one term as Oregon governor, from 1987 to 1991.\n\nGoldschmidt announced in 1990 that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wouldn't seek a second term, saying, \"It will require more of myself than I am prepared to give.\" He never sought elected office again. The decision by one of Oregon's most revered politicians was shocking, and left many wondering why he'd walk away from a career on the rise.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was mayor, he had a sexual relationship that began when the girl was 14. Under Oregon law at the time, the sexual encounters would have been considered statutory rape because of the girl's age, but he escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nGoldschmidt confessed to The Oregonian as the rival Willamette Week was preparing to publish an article revealing the abuse. He claimed the relationship -- which he called an \"affair\" -- lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years. In interviews that were published after her death in 2011, the woman told newspapers that it actually continued for more than a decade and contributed to a tragic life of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nThe abuse was revealed months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric. He retreated from public life.\n\n\"In the 35 years since I failed this young woman, her family, and my family, the pain has never eased,\" Goldschmidt told The Oregonian in an email after the victim died in 2011.\n\nWhen the abuse became public, Goldschmidt's portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.\n\nState Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, who along with others requested the painting's removal, said there is no room for forgiveness or redemption given what happened. Had his abuse been reported at the time, \"there would be no public legacy for Neil Goldschmidt. He wouldn't have been secretary of transportation, he wouldn't have been governor of Oregon. His career would have ended rather abruptly.\"\n\nAs governor, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming Oregon's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.\n\nAs student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education.

Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nHis governorship didn't win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy.\n\nHe was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.\n\nAn independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.\n\nAfter leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nHe spent his last years alternating between homes in southwest Portland and the bucolic Provence region of France. Friends said he desperately wanted to reengage in public policy, but had resigned himself to a much more anonymous retirement.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.\n\nThe late Associated Press reporter Steven DuBois contributed to this obituary.

Neil Goldschmidt has died", "body": "Goldschmidt, once a towering figure in state and national politics, admitted sexually abusing a teenager and attempting to cover it up.\n\nFormer Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, one of the state's most powerful figures before revelations that he had sexually abused a teenager, died Wednesday, two days before he would have turned 84.\n\nAs the young mayor of Portland in the 1970s, Goldschmidt was an electrifying figure. While many American cities were falling apart, he presided over a flurry of innovation in the City of Roses. He helped kill a freeway and launch a light rail. Under his watch, inner-city neighborhoods were lavished with money and attention. Buses sped passengers for free through a downtown transit mall.\n\nPortland historian Carl Abbott said Goldschmidt showed early in his political career that he was a consummate power broker: \"Unlike some other people who think they are dealmakers, he could actually see common points among disparate interests and see how you could pull them together -- find something they could all agree on.\"\n\nGoldschmidt vaulted to national prominence as President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary. He returned to Oregon and won the governorship in 1986 and eventually morphed into a powerful behind-the-scenes consultant.\n\nBy the early 2000s, he was asked to take charge of efforts to remake Oregon's system of higher education. And he was the front man for a Texas firm's audacious deal to buy Portland General Electric -- the state's largest utility.\n\nThen came the news in 2004: Goldschmidt admitted abusing a 14-year-old girl while he was Portland's mayor.\n\nThe girl was the daughter of a Goldschmidt friend and one-time aide.\n\nWillamette Week reporter Nigel Jaquiss broke the story. He tracked a secret $250,000 settlement that Goldschmidt had reached with his victim in 1994.\n\n\"He was a big part of what made Portland, Portland,\" Jaquiss said. \"So it was, yes, very hard to square with the public image of this successful politician, hard to square with anybody really. I mean, we're talking about an unspeakable crime here.\"\n\nGoldschmidt apologized, closed his consulting firm and left public life. Because too much time had passed, he was protected from prosecution.\n\nAbbott, the historian, said many Oregonians found it hard to even talk about this man who had once been so central to Portland and the state.\n\n\"I think it's only in the last few years that people are willing to really say Neil Goldschmidt out loud again, as opposed to 'he who shall not be named,'\" he said several years ago.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in 1940 in Eugene. He attended the University of Oregon, where he was student president. Afterward, he spent time in Israel and in Mississippi with the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nHe later settled in Portland, worked as a legal aid attorney and surfed a rising tide of civic activism.\n\nHe was elected to the Portland City Council in 1970 and became mayor two years later. Goldschmidt was the best of salesmen for vibrant, remade cities. As he said in 1976, speaking on PBS: \"The housing programs and the interstate highway act after World War II subsidized the suburbs. And when the cities come back now and say, 'Look we have a transportation problem,' we're charged with asking for a handout.\"\n\nFor all his ease with neighborhood activists, Goldschmidt also was quick to build ties with the business community. He worked at Nike in the early 1980s and came to idolize the company's co-founder, Phil Knight.\n\nGoldschmidt was a Democrat. But in some ways, he ran to the right of his Republican rival, Norma Paulus, in their heated 1986 race for governor.\n\nIn office, he championed regional economic development plans. He poured tens of millions into prison construction. And he launched a children's agenda proclaiming: \"We guarantee to every child in every region of our state a greater chance for a decent life.\"\n\nGoldschmidt sometimes struggled to get things done as governor. But it was a shock in 1990 when he suddenly announced he wouldn't run for re-election. He cited the personal turmoil of a planned divorce from his wife, Margie.\n\nOnly years later did it appear more likely that Goldschmidt feared his secret would be exposed.\n\nOnce out of office, Goldschmidt opened his own consulting firm with a long list of well-heeled clients, including Nike, Weyerhaeuser and billionaire Paul Allen. He also started a well-regarded nonprofit that helps children learn to read.\n\nHe appeared to relish his new role and the money that came along with it.\n\n\"Finances were certainly part of it,\" said Tom Imeson, Goldschmidt's chief of staff as governor and later a partner in his consulting firm. \"Because he wouldn't have done most of these things if they said, 'Would you just do it.' But the challenge of a project was something that got his juices flowing too.\"\n\nHe also attracted many enemies as he amassed power. His years of hiding the truth were coming to an end.\n\n\"He wanted to keep it a secret, but in order to keep it a secret, a lot of people had to find out about that. I mean, there were people giving her cash payments,\" said Margie Boul\u00e9, a former TV newswoman who first met Goldschmidt in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2011, Boul\u00e9 wrote a story for The Oregonian recounting a series of conversations she had with the victim before the victim's death at the age of 49.\n\nGoldschmidt's victim had suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse and said the abuse from Goldschmidt lasted much longer than he had claimed.\n\n\"I thought a lot of her problems were a direct result of what had been done to her by Neil Goldschmidt,\" Boul\u00e9 said. \"And she did. She thought that too.\"\n\nGoldschmidt issued a statement when that story came out. He said much of the victim's account was fabricated. But he said he wasn't \"trying to defend myself because there is no defense.\"", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At the time, he became the nation's youngest big-city mayor, responsible for revitalizing the downtown area, per Oregon Live, and he was seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to Goldschmidt's victim, who died in hospice in 2011, the sexual encounters between her and Goldschmidt continued until she was 27.\n\nDuring this time frame, Goldschmidt served as secretary of transportation in the Carter administration. Following Jimmy Carter's defeat in 1979, Goldschmidt returned to work at Nike, where he was vice president in charge of international sales from 1981 to 1985, then president of Nike Canada from 1985 to 1987.\n\nOver these years, Goldschmidt's victim reportedly struggled to hold a job, abused alcohol and drugs, and attempted to kill herself multiple times. Her dreams as a little girl of being a Supreme Court justice were far out of reach. Her chatter to people about the abuse she suffered under Goldschmidt got back to him, and he sent handlers to deal with her.\n\nGoldschmidt ran for governor and won in 1986. People were shocked when he decided against running for a second term.\n\nWhile the statute of limitations had run out for Goldschmidt's sexual abuse, his victim filed a civil suit against Goldschmidt, and they both agreed to a settlement.\n\nIt wasn't until 2004 that Democratic state Sen. Vicki Walker tipped off the press that Goldschmidt had paid a settlement fee to the victim.\n\nThe Oregonian published a story in May 2004 that included a partial confession from Goldschmidt, and reporting from the Willamette Week later uncovered more details behind Goldschmidt's scandal.\n\nWhile many members of the public have condemned Goldschmidt, he still had the backing of close friends and family.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Neil was a force of personality and the patriarch of our large, blended family. Although he battled many health issues for years, he was actively engaged with family and friends in discussions about school, business, politics and wine until the day of his passing,\" they said in

He was 83.\n\nFamily members confirmed the death but did not provide a specific cause.\n\nFor much of the 1970s, Mr. Goldschmidt was seen as a rising star in Democratic politics. He was elected mayor in 1972, at age 32, becoming one of the youngest and most vigorous leaders of a major American city.\n\nHe converted a busy highway into a popular riverfront park and developed the seeds of a robust public transit system, including a widely praised light-rail transit system. He was credited with providing the spark for downtown revitalization. Portland sports fans recall Hall of Fame center Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first -- and only -- NBA championship in 1977.\n\nIn 1979, Mr. Goldschmidt left City Hall to become President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp. After Carter lost his reelection bid, Mr. Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for athletic apparel giant Nike.\n\nHe served one term as Oregon governor, from 1987 to 1991, leading the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming Oregon's workers' compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.\n\nMr. Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many residents feared growth. He also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.\n\nMr. Goldschmidt announced in 1990 that he and his wife, the former Margie Wood, were separating and he would not seek a second term, saying, \"It will require more of myself than I am prepared to give.\" He never sought elected office again. The decision by one of Oregon's most revered politicians was shocking, and left many wondering why he would walk away from a career on the rise.\n\nThe question may have been answered when Mr. Goldschmidt admitted in 2004, that while he was mayor, he began years of taking sexual advantage of the teenage daughter of an aide. Some reports said she was 14 at the time, others 13.\n\nUnder Oregon law at the time, the abuse would have been considered statutory rape because of the girl's age, but he escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nMr. Goldschmidt confessed to the Oregonian as the rival Willamette Week was preparing to publish an article revealing the abuse. He claimed the relationship -- which he called an \"affair\" -- lasted for about a year.\n\nIn interviews that were published after her death in 2011, at age 49, the woman said the abuse continued for more than a decade and contributed to a life of alcohol and drug abuse. Willamette Week's reporter received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.\n\nThe abuse was revealed months after Mr. Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric. He retreated from public life.\n\nNeil Edward Goldschmidt was born in Eugene, Ore., on June 16, 1940. At the University of Oregon, he was student body president and received a degree in political science in 1963. He graduated from University of California at Berkeley's law school in 1967, then spent two years as a legal aid lawyer in Portland.\n\nAfter leaving the governorship, he founded the Oregon Children's Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.\n\nIn 1994, he married Diana Snowden, a Portland utility executive with whom he bought a winery that produced a high-end pinot noir, according to the Oregonian. In addition to his wife and two children from his first marriage, a complete list of survivors was not immediately available.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He died at home in Portland with his family at his side. The reported cause was heart failure.\n\nGoldschmidt's turbulent life was a study in political scandal. His high-energy leadership style thrust him into the upper circles of power, including a heady stint inside President Jimmy Carter's administration. His crash into political purgatory, after he was forced to confess to statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl, left him shunned and unforgiven in the state he loved.\n\nHe spent his last years alternating between homes in Southwest Portland and the bucolic Provence region of France, where he pursued his passion for fine wines. Friends said he desperately wanted to re-engage in public policy, but had resigned himself to a much more anonymous retirement.\n\nFor a time, it seemed Goldschmidt commanded the center of Oregon's political and business echelons. As a one-term Democratic governor, he oversaw Oregon's comeback from a recession that ravaged the state's timber industry but sowed the seeds of a high-tech makeover of the economy.\n\nAs Carter's transportation secretary, he turned the nation's attention to alternative transportation even as he steered a controversial bailout of Chrysler. As a Nike executive, he led the giant athletic company's international operations. As a top-dollar lobbyist and consultant, he worked deals that reached from Portland's Park Blocks to Weyerhaeuser's boardroom.\n\nIt was during his six years as mayor, however, that a young, brash and ambitious Goldschmidt left his most lasting marks. He pushed for and won initiatives to turn what some called \"Stumptown\" into an ambitious, pedestrian friendly, transit-oriented model of smart growth and new urbanism.\n\nIn short, he laid the groundwork for the modern image of Portland as one of the nation's most livable cities. But it was also during that time that he began a sexual relationship with an underage neighborhood girl a secret he kept buried for nearly 30 years. Goldschmidt's victim died in 2011.\n\n\"In no way can we gloss over what he did,\" said longtime Goldschmidt confidant Gerry Frank, who died in 2022. \"It was wrong. He knows it, everybody does. But Neil Goldschmidt is probably the smartest, most charismatic, most visionary guy that Oregon has produced in a long, long time.\"\n\nSo it goes with Goldschmidt. He will be remembered as someone once credibly thought of as presidential material, but whose official portrait was summarily removed from its place of honor in the state Capitol and exiled to a storage warehouse in Gresham.\n\nNeil Edward Goldschmidt was born June 16, 1940, in Eugene, to parents Lester and Annette Goldschmidt. He attended South Eugene High School, where he starred in drama productions and on sports teams. He cut his political teeth at the University of Oregon, where he was elected student body president and later recruited students to join the civil rights movement. His was a close-knit family and would remain so throughout Goldschmidt's political and personal ups and downs.\n\nTom Imeson, whom Goldschmidt recruited during the 1986 governor's race, remembers a trip to Eugene that included dinner and an overnight at the family house in a quiet neighborhood near the university. Imeson who later became one of Goldschmidt's closest associates in politics and business was given the candidate's boyhood bedroom for the night.\n\nIn a statement, his family said, \"Neil was a force of personality and the patriarch of our large, blended family. Although he battled many health issues for years, he was actively engaged with family and friends in discussions about school, business, politics and wine until the day of his passing. We will deeply miss his presence in our lives and hope that those mourning his passing can remember the significant positive contributions he made to our community.\"", "source": {"uri":

Neil Goldschmidt, one of the state's most powerful figures before revelations that he had sexually abused a teenager, died Wednesday, two days before he would have turned 84.\n\nAs the young mayor of Portland in the 1970s, Goldschmidt was an electrifying figure. While many American cities were falling apart, he presided over a flurry of innovation in the City of Roses. He helped kill a freeway and launch a light rail. Under his watch, inner-city neighborhoods were lavished with money and attention. Buses sped passengers for free through a downtown transit mall.\n\nPortland historian Carl Abbott said Goldschmidt showed early in his political career that he was a consummate power broker: \"Unlike some other people who think they are dealmakers, he could actually see common points among disparate interests and see how you could pull them together -- find something they could all agree on.\"\n\nGoldschmidt vaulted to national prominence as President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary. He returned to Oregon and won the governorship in 1986 and eventually morphed into a powerful behind-the-scenes consultant.\n\nhttps://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/06/12/former-oregon-gov-neil-goldschmidt-has-died/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transit mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inner city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_rail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Light rail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Action_Figures", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Action Figures", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647672", "eventUri": "eng-9647672", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Anthony Rizzo has struggled this season and was benched on June 9 and 10. The Yankees seem poised to make a deep postseason run, and an upgrade at first base could help tremendously. Former National League MVP Paul Goldschmidt \"would make sense for the Yankees as a rental,\" according to The Athletic's Chris Kirschner.\n\n\"How about Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, another free agent at the end of the season? Goldschmidt's performance hasn't matched his stellar track record, but there aren't many players better than him,\" wrote Kirschner. \"If the Cardinals fall out of the playoff race in the next several weeks, he would make sense for the Yankees as a rental.\"\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals are 31-34 and in last place in the National League Central. They could be unloading some older players, and Goldschmidt could be on the move.\n\nGoldschmidt has spent the last six seasons on the Cardinals. The seven-time All-Star has not produced in 2024 like years past, but could still play a role on the Yankees if he were traded. Goldschmidt was a suggested trade candidate for the Yankees earlier this season as well.\n\n\"I think it depends on how Goldschmidt performs between now and the trade deadline,\" The Athletic's Jim Bowden wrote on May 23. \"If he shows over the next couple of months that he would be an upgrade over [Anthony] Rizzo or an upgrade in a platoon with him, then I would consider it. He's still a plus defender at first base, a leader in the clubhouse and a flat-out winner.\"\n\nRizzo, a three-time All-Star himself, has struggled immensely in 2024. He is slashing .220/.279/.332 on the year. Goldschmidt is struggling in 2024, but with his track record of success, it's not out of the question that he can turn things around.\n\nGoldschmidt has a .225 batting average with a .646 OPS in 63 games this season. He has seven home runs on the season.\n\nUnlike Rizzo, Goldschmidt's advanced metrics show some signs of life. Goldschmidt has a 44.6 hard hit percentage in 2024. That mark is actually higher than two of his All-Star seasons, 2016 and 2018.\n\nGoldschmidt has five Silver Sluggers and four Gold Glove Awards to go with his MVP and seven All-Star selections. The 36-year-old will be a free agent after this season.\n\n\"I wouldn't overpay for Goldschmidt, who will turn 37 in September, considering he's a rental and has the same age and decline issues as Rizzo,\" wrote Bowden. \"However, to deepen the lineup and protect against future injuries, it makes some sense.\"\n\nThe Yankees have not had much depth at first base this season.

While many American cities were falling apart, he presided over a flurry of innovation in the City of Roses. He helped kill a freeway and launch a light rail. Under his watch, inner-city neighborhoods were lavished with money and attention. Buses sped passengers for free through a downtown transit mall.\n\nPortland historian Carl Abbott said Goldschmidt showed early in his political career that he was a consummate power broker: \"Unlike some other people who think they are dealmakers, he could actually see common points among disparate interests and see how you could pull them together -- find something they could all agree on.\"\n\nGoldschmidt vaulted to national prominence as President Jimmy Carter's transportation secretary. He returned to Oregon and won the governorship in 1986 and eventually morphed into a powerful behind-the-scenes consultant.\n\nBy the early 2000s, he was asked to take charge of efforts to remake Oregon's system of higher education.

Hitting just .226 with a .653 OPS, he now has eight home runs and 27 RBI in his age 36 season.\n\nGoldschmidt has more than those 335 homers for his career - he actually has 348 but those other 13 came while playing other positions in the lineup. He's a lifetime .290 hitter who has spent his entire career in the National League. He's in his 14th major league season with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cardinals.

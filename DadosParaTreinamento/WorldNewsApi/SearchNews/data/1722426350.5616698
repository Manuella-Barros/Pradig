Party members once united behind Biden are now scouring candidate resumes and researching rules for a contingency plan to present voters with a different nominee after a universally panned performance Thursday night cemented worries about the president\u2019s ability to serve a second term.\u201cThe easiest one is, Biden takes himself out of the race,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member and author of a book about the presidential nominating process. \u201cThen yes, there\u2019s rules and procedures and the party would replace him.\u201dWhile pushing Biden off the ticket is possible, the lack of an obvious candidate to replace him makes such a gambit all the more unlikely, Kamarck said.The debate saw months of Democratic anxiety over Biden, already the oldest US president in history at 81, and his prospects for defeating Trump, boil over. The president Friday acknowledged the limitations of his debate showing but dismissed calls to exit the race. Delegate RevoltIf Biden doesn\u2019t step aside, forcing him out would be a Herculean undertaking for Democrats.Any rival would first have to collect 600 delegate signatures on a petition to place his or her name in nomination at the Democratic convention \u2014 with no more than 50 signatures from any one state. That\u2019s about 13 per cent of the delegates. But with Biden controlling 99 per cent of the pledged delegates, that would require challengers convincing Biden loyalists to flip their support.\u201cThe odds are not insurmountable, but they\u2019re very high for any scenario that involves a delegate revolt,\u201d said Josh Putnam of FHQ Strategies, a non-partisan consulting firm specialising in delegate selection rules. \u201cMore often than not these are pretty fervent Biden supporters,\u201d Putnam said of the delegates.The Biden campaign has vetted his convention delegates for their loyalty, but they do have room to change their minds. Unlike Republican delegates, who are often legally bound to cast their vote for a particular candidate, Democratic rules say only that pledged delegates \u201cshall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201dStill it\u2019s the kind of move most politicians wouldn\u2019t attempt unless success were guaranteed. Challengers who fail to oust an incumbent president from the ticket risk becoming party pariahs.\u201cThis is not something that a lot of people could pull off,\u201d said Kamarck.Open ConventionA move to change the ticket \u2014 whether Biden agrees to go willingly or is pushed out \u2014 would bring a convention free-for-all not seen for decades.In an \u201copen\u201d or \u201cbrokered\u201d convention, no candidate comes into the roll-call vote with enough delegates to be guaranteed the nomination. Voting could last any number of rounds until a candidate wins.By Gregory KorteSuch a convention would also put so-called \u201csuper-delegates\u201d in the spotlight. Those delegates \u2014 leaders and elected officials who get to the convention by virtue of their position \u2014 have been stripped of some powers in recent years as the party worried their influence in the process was undemocratic. But if a nomination goes into a second ballot, those automatic delegates, who number more than 700, could sway the convention. Another wild card is that the party is free to change its rules at any time before the nomination, potentially lowering or raising the bar for a Biden challenger.The most obvious heir apparent is Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 but Democrats don\u2019t have to pick Biden\u2019s running mate. Some of the most discussed alternatives include Governors Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, all of whom say they still support Biden.The nomination vote was scheduled for Aug. 21, but the DNC has raised the possibility of a virtual roll call before Aug. 7 to accommodate early ballot deadlines. Eleventh Hour If Biden steps aside after the convention, the decision on how to replace him would be up to a smaller group: The more than 400 members of the DNC. By party rules, the DNC chairman would consult with Democratic congressional leaders and governors and make a recommendation.Democrats last used that process in 1972 to replace Thomas Eagleton, the vice presidential nominee forced off the ballot after acknowledging that he had received electroshock therapy for depression, with Sargent Shriver. But a late switch could present Democrats with another problem: Ballot deadlines. Some states, including battlegrounds Pennsylvania and North Carolina, allow ballots to be mailed out as early as two months before Election Day, meaning Biden\u2019s name would continue to appear even if he\u2019s not the candidate. One advantage of the Electoral College system is those votes would still count, Kamarck said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really vote for president. We vote for electors to president,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same electors no matter who\u2019s at the top of the ballot.\u201d", "summary": "If Biden doesn't step aside, forcing him out would be a Herculean undertaking for Democrats", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/here-s-what-the-democrats-need-to-do-to-replace-joe-biden-as-nominee-124062900175_1.html", "image": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-06/29/full/1719629405-0833.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:37:25", "author": "Bloomberg", "authors": ["Bloomberg"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.016}

{"id": 223691796, "title": "Viagra gets better funding than women\u2019s health, says Laura Bates", "text": "It\u2019s time to recognise that \u201call women\u2019s healthcare is in crisis\u201d, said Everyday Sexism founder Laura Bates. In an exclusive by The Independent earlier this month, leading health experts warned that \u201cthreadbare\u201d NHS maternity care is leaving new mothers dangerously at risk, as mental health and community services are being slashed. The first UK inquiry into birth trauma was published last week, with its authors calling for a system where \u201cpoor care is the exception rather than rule\u201d. The inquiry encountered incidents where women had experienced birth injuries so severe they had been forced to stop working, as well as accounts of babies that were stillborn or born with conditions that were caused by mistakes and failures, many of which were covered up before and during labour. Speaking on a panel at Hay Festival, in partnership with The Independent, Bates said that \u201canything that affects women is low priority\u201d. \u201cWe need investment, we need care, we need to actually do some research into women\u2019s health, and into the impact that all of this has,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe do a huge amount more research and put loads more funding into Viagra than we do into issues affecting women \u2013 go figure. \u201cSo it\u2019s a crisis. We need to recognise it\u2019s a crisis, we need to recognise it\u2019s a gendered crisis, and we need to invest.\u201d Bates also spoke of a \u201cforgotten generation\u201d of women during Covid, who were \u201cforced to give birth alone while pubs were heaving\u201d. She called this \u201cabsolutely unacceptable prioritising by a group of men in a room making their own decisions.\u201d \u201cAnd those women need support as well \u2013 it\u2019s not just about existing postnatal care, which is absolutely dire.\u201d Many of these women are now \u201ccoping with PTSD and the mental health implications of that,\u201d she added. Bates was speaking on a panel about the day\u2019s headlines, alongside Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting and author Peter Pomerantsev, chaired by The Independent editor-in-chief Geordie Greig. When asked what he would do to make women feel safer giving birth on the NHS under a Labour government, Streeting said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to deal with the understaffing, and train thousands more midwives to deal with that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m shocked at the way women are basically ignored in terms of postnatal care. It\u2019s all about the baby \u2013 important, but no one asks the mothers about their health, and particularly the injuries they suffer,\u201d he said, adding that he had had \u201cconversations with some of my friends that I never imagined I\u2019d have, about some of the injuries they sustained during childbirth\u201d. He also said that he was \u201cabsolutely determined to make sure that when it comes to clinical trials and medical research, that we get parity of esteem and representation for women in medical research. It can\u2019t all be about the boys.\u201d He agreed with Bates that the NHS was not \u201cdesigned with women in mind\u201d, stating that otherwise \u201cthey would not be waiting over eight years for a diagnosis on a common condition like endometriosis\u201d.

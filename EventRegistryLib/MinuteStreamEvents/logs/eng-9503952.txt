The fragile lagoon city of Venice begins a pilot program Thursday to charge daytrippers a 5 euro entry fee that authorities hope will discourage tourists from arriving on peak days. The daytripper tax is being tested on 29 days through July, mostly weekends and holidays starting with Italy's Liberation Day holiday Thursday. Officials expect some 10,000 people will pay the fee to access the city on the first day, downloading a QR code to prove their payment, while another 70,000 will receive exceptions, for example, because they work in Venice or live in the Veneto region.\n\nVENICE, Italy (AP) -- Under the gaze of the world's media, the fragile lagoon city of Venice launched a pilot program Thursday to charge day-trippers a 5-euro ($5.35) entry fee that authorities hope will discourage visitors from arriving on peak days and make the city more livable for its dwindling residents.\n\nVisitors arriving at Venice's main train station were greeted with large signs listing the 29 dates through July of the plan's test phase that also designated separate entrances for tourists, and residents, students and workers.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said Simone Venturini, the city's top tourism official. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, insisting that only a resurgence in the population will restore balance to a city where narrow alleyways and water buses are often clogged with tourists.\n\nHundreds of Venetians protested against the program, marching festively though the city's main bus terminal behind banners reading \"No to Tickets, Yes to Services and Housing.\" Protesters scuffled briefly with police with riot gear who blocked them from entering the city, before changing course and entering over another bridge escorted by plainclothes police officers. The demonstration wrapped up peacefully in a piazza.\n\nTourists arriving at the main station encountered almost as many journalists as stewards on hand to politely guide anyone unaware of the new requirements through the process of downloading the QR code to pay the fee.\n\nArianna Cecilia, a tourist from Rome visiting Venice for the first time, said she thought it was \"strange\" to have to pay to enter a city in her native country, and be funneled through separate entrance ways for tourists. She and her boyfriend were staying in nearby Treviso, and so downloaded the QR code as required. But she was still caught off-guard while soaking in her first view ever of Venice's canals by the sight of the entrance signs and her boyfriend telling her to get out the ticket.\n\nOn the other side of the entrance ways, workers in yellow vests carried out random checks at the train station. Transgressors face fines of 50 to 300 euros ($53 to $320), but officials said \"common sense\" was being applied for the launch.\n\nThe requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free and unchecked.\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of overtourism, and officials hope that the pilot project can help provide more exact figures to better manage the phenomenon.\n\nThe city can track the number of hotel visitors, which last year numbered 4.6 million and is down 16% from pre-pandemic highs. But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cellphone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete.\n\n\"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. On peak days, local police set up one-way traffic for pedestrians to keep the crowds moving.\n\nResidents opposing the day-tripper tax insist that the solution to Venice's woes are to boost the resident population and the services they need, limiting short-term rentals to make available more housing and attract families back from the mainland.\n\nLast year, Venice passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park. You don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro declared the launch day, coinciding with an Italian holiday, a success, registering 15,700 paying visitors, 50% more than anticipated.\n\nMore than 97,000 others had downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. Hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, provided a QR code for visitors to attest to their stay, which includes a hotel tax -- accounting for 40,000 of those.\n\nVenturini, the tourist official, said that interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities, and municipalities abroad such as Barcelona, Spain, and Amsterdam.\n\nBut Marina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, doesn't see the fee as the cure-all. Neighboring apartments in her residential building near the famed Rialto Bridge once inhabited by families are now short-term apartment rentals.\n\nThe corner butcher shop closed. Yet she noted that the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for the traditional aperitivo, which can grow rowdy.\n\nShe was passing out mock European Union passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian Constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii. It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen. That is what would counter this wild tourism,'' Rodino said.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Instead, the goal is to try to persuade day-trippers to visit during quieter times.\n\n\"I think it's good, because it will perhaps slow down the numbers of tourists in Venice,\" said Sylvain Pelerin, a French tourist who has been visiting for more than 50 years.\n\nOvernight visitors, who already pay a tourist tax, minors under the age of 14 and others are exempt.\n\nBut some residents are strongly opposed to a measure they say curbs fundamental rights to freedom of movement.\n\nAround 300 people protested near the station on Thursday morning, holding up signs such as \"Stick it to the ticket!\" and \"Venice is not for sale!\"\n\n\"This is not a museum, it's not a protected ecological area, you shouldn't have to pay -- it's a city,\" Marina Dodino, from the local residents association ARCI, told AFP.\n\n- 'Soft controls' -\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has said the new scheme is \"an experiment\", monitored with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\".\n\nThere are no turnstiles or barriers, with inspectors instead carrying out checks at key entry points into the city.\n\nThey will be able to fine those without tickets, ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nBut an official told AFP none are expected on Thursday as authorities seek to persuade rather than punish.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as destinations around the world grapple with huge numbers of tourists, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming local communities and fragile sites.\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site in 1987.\n\nBut the numbers of people seeking to experience what the UN cultural body calls an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\" have become overwhelming.\n\nAt peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic centre of Venice, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nUNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\n- 'New balance' -\n\nAuthorities had already imposed a ban in 2021 on the massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nThe ticket idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\n\"The aim is to find a new balance between tourism and the city of its residents,\" Simone Venturini, the local councillor responsible for tourism, told AFP.\n\nHe hopes the initiative will persuade Italians living in the region to avoid busy days such as Thursday, a public holiday in Italy, marking the liberation from the Nazis and Fascism.\n\nBut Ashish Thakkar, an American tourist visiting Venice with his wife, questioned how much of an effect the day pass would have.\n\n\"If I'm coming all the way from out of the country, five euros just to get access to the city -- I wouldn't mind paying it,\" he told AFP.\n\nSome residents complain the measures fail to address another major issue -- the expansion of short-term lets through websites such as Airbnb, which are squeezing out long-term tenants.\n\nIn Florence, which also suffers from mass tourism, authorities have banned new short-term private holiday lets in the historic centre and offered tax breaks for landlords who switch back to ordinary leases.\n\n\"You have to

The new strategy to lower the number of tourists visiting the UNESCO World Heritage site calls for day-trippers to pay a five-euro ticket to enter the historic city centre and is due to start on April 25. MARCO BERTORELLO / AFP\n\nVenice's mayor hailed Thursday the smooth launch of a trial of entry fees for day visitors despite protests by residents, saying tourism in the historic Italian city had to change.\n\nFor the first time, visitors exploring Venice for the day were required to buy a five-euro ($5.30) ticket, enforced by spot checks at key points of entry into the UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nMayor Luigi Brugnaro said 15,700 people bought tickets on Thursday, the first of 29 days throughout 2024 when the entry fee will be charged as part of a trial -- the first such scheme in the world.\n\nHe noted that for now, the test was costing more than the entry fees were bringing in, calling it a worthy investment.\n\n\"This is not an expense -- it is a way to make people understand that we need to change and therefore dilute visits to the city,\" he said in a statement.\n\nConsidered one of the most beautiful cities on the planet, Venice is a top tourist destination -- but is drowning under the weight of the crowds.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of tickets available.

Brugnaro's office said checks by around 75 inspectors at more than a dozen control points had identified no major issues.\n\nThose without tickets face fines of 50 to 300 euros, though officials said they are seeking to persuade rather than punish.\n\nUNESCO threat\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched by other destinations grappling with mass tourism, which boosts the local economy but risks

The fragile lagoon city of Venice begins a pilot program Thursday to charge daytrippers a 5 euro entry fee that authorities hope will discourage tourists from arriving on peak days. The daytripper tax is being tested on 29 days through July, mostly weekends and holidays starting with Italy's Liberation Day holiday Thursday. Officials expect some 10,000 people will pay the fee to access the city on the first day, downloading a QR code to prove their payment, while another 70,000 will receive exceptions, for example, because they work in Venice or live in the Veneto region.\n\nVENICE, Italy (AP) -- Under the gaze of the world's media, the fragile lagoon city of Venice launched a pilot program Thursday to charge day-trippers a 5-euro (around $5.35) entry fee that authorities hope will discourage visitors from arriving on peak days and make the city more livable for its dwindling residents.\n\nVisitors arriving at Venice's main train station were greeted with large signs listing the 29 dates through July of the plan's test phase that also designated separate entrances for tourists, and residents, students and workers.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said Simone Venturini, the city's top tourism official. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, insisting that only a resurgence in the population will restore balance to a city where narrow alleyways and water buses are often clogged with tourists.\n\nHundreds of Venetians protested against the program, marching festively though the city's main bus terminal behind banners reading \"No to Tickets, Yes to Services and Housing.\" Protesters scuffled briefly with police with riot gear who blocked them from entering the city, before changing course and entering over another bridge escorted by plainclothes police. The demostration wrapped up peacefully in a piazza.\n\nTourists arriving at the main station encountered almost as many journalists as stewards on hand to politely guide anyone unaware of the new requirements through the process of downloading the QR code to pay the fee.\n\nArianna Cecilia, a tourist from Rome visiting Venice for the first time, said she thought it was \"strange\" to have to pay to enter a city in her native country, and be funneled through separate entrance ways for tourists. She and her boyfriend were staying in nearby Treviso, and so downloaded the QR code as required, but she was still caught off-guard while soaking in her first view ever of Venice's canals by the sight of the entrance signs and her boyfriend telling her to get out the ticket.\n\nOn the other side of the entrance ways, workers in yellow vests carried out random checks at the train station. Transgressors faces fines of 50 to 300 euros ($53 to $320), but officials said \"common sense\" was being applied for the launch.\n\nThe requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free and unchecked.\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of overtourism, and officials hope that the pilot project can help provide more exact figures to better manage the phenomenon.\n\nThe city can track the number of hotel visitors, which last year numbered 4.6 million and is down 16% from pre-pandemic highs. But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cellphone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete.\n\n\"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. On peak days, local police set up one-way traffic for pedestrians to keep the crowds moving.\n\nResidents opposing the day-tripper tax insist that the solution to Venice's woes are to boost the resident population and the services they need, limiting short-term rentals to make available more housing and attract families back from the mainland.\n\nLast year, Venice passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park. You don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenice officials expected paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach about 10,000. More than 70,000 others had downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. Hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should provide a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nVenturini, the tourist official, said that interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities, and municipalities abroad such as Barcelona, Spain, and Amsterdam.\n\nBut Marina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, doesn't see the fee as the cure-all. Neighboring apartments in her residential building near the famed Rialto Bridge once inhabited by families are now short-term apartment rentals.\n\nThe corner butcher shop closed. Yet she noted that the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for the traditional aperitivo, which can grow rowdy.\n\nShe was passing out mock European Union passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian Constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii. It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen. That is what would counter this wild tourism,'' Rodino said.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Venice will begin on April 25, 2024 charging day trippers for entry, a world first aimed at easing pressure on the Italian city drowning under the weight of mass tourism. AFP\n\nVENICE -- The ticket office is in place and the inspectors are primed -- Venice launches a new scheme Thursday to charge day-trippers looking to enter the historic Italian city, a world first intended to ease the pressure of mass tourism.\n\nVisitors entering the UNESCO World Heritage site for the day will have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, with inspectors carrying out spot checks at key entry points.\n\nConsidered one of the most beautiful cities on the planet, Venice is one of the world's top tourist destinations -- but is drowning under the weight of the crowds.\n\nUnder the trial system, so-called Access Fee tickets will be required only on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July, with the goal of persuading day-trippers to visit during quieter times.\n\nREAD: Mass protests in Canary Islands decry overtourism\n\n\"The aim is to find a new balance between tourism and the city of its residents,\" Simone Venturini, the local councillor responsible for tourism, told AFP.\n\n\"We must work to reduce the impact of daily tourism on certain days... (which) generates stress for the city,\", he said.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as destinations around the world grapple with huge numbers of tourists, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming local communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nUNESCO warning\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site in 1987.\n\nBut the numbers of people seeking to experience what the UN cultural body calls an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\" are widely considered to be unsustainable.\n\nREAD: We're full! Europe's fight against overtourism\n\nAt peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic centre of Venice, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nUNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nAshish Thakkar, an American tourist visiting on Wednesday with his wife, questioned how much of an effect the day pass would have.\n\n\"If I'm coming all the way from out of the country, five euros just to get access to the city -- I wouldn't mind paying it,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to make a big difference.\"\n\nVenturini hopes the initiative will persuade Italians living in the region not to come on busy days such as Thursday, when Italy marks its World War II Liberation Day.\n\nVenice had already imposed a ban in 2021 on the massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, acknowledged that the tickets were \"an experiment\", and officials are not entirely sure how the system is going to pan out.\n\nNo queues\n\nEarlier this month, Brugnaro told reporters the new system would be monitored with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\".\n\nVisitors are being encouraged to buy their tickets online beforehand, but will be able to buy one on arrival.\n\nA new ticket office has been set up on the square in front of the Santa Lucia train station, the main point of entry into the city.\n\nControllers will carry out spot checks in key areas, with fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros ($53 to $320).\n\nTourists staying in Venice, who already pay an overnight tax for the privilege, are exempt from the new tickets, as are those arriving between 4:00 pm and 8:30 am, minors under 14 and the disabled.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of day tickets --

The lagoon city of Venice begins a pilot program Thursday, April 25, 2024 to charge daytrippers a 5 euro entry fee that authorities hope will discourage tourists from arriving on peak days. Officials expect some 10,000 people will pay the fee to access the city on the first day, downloading a QR code to prove their payment.\n\nVENICE, Italy (AP) -- Under the gaze of the world's media, the fragile lagoon city of Venice launched a pilot program Thursday to charge day-trippers a 5-euro (around $5.35) entry fee that authorities hope will discourage visitors from arriving on peak days and make the city more livable for its dwindling residents.\n\nVisitors arriving at Venice's main train station were greeted with large signs listing the 29 dates through July of the plan's test phase, as well as new entrances separating tourists from residents, students and workers.\n\nStewards were on hand to politely guide anyone unaware of the new requirements through the process of downloading the QR code to pay the fee.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nArianna Cecilia, who lives in Rome and was visiting Venice for the first time with her boyfriend, said it felt \"strange\" to have to buy a ticket to enter a city in her native Italy, and then pass through a tourist entrance.\n\nThe couple were staying in nearby Treviso, and had paid the fee and downloaded the QR code as required prior to arrival.\n\nWorkers in yellow vests carried out random checks at the train station, and anyone caught faces fines of 50 euros to 300 euros -- though officials said \"common sense\" was being applied for the launch.\n\nThe requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free and unchecked.\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, and officials hope the pilot project can help provide more exact figures to better manage the phenomenon.\n\nThe city can track the number of hotel visitors -- which last year numbered 4.6 million, down 16% from pre-pandemic highs. But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cell phone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete. \"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism. Some say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.\n\nMarina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, is opposed to the new plan. She was passing out mock EU passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\nRodino has seen her local butcher close and families leave her neighborhood near the famed Rialto Bridge as short-term apartment rentals spring up. But she said the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for often rowdy gatherings.\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii,\" she said. \"It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen. That is what would counter this wild tourism.\"", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Instead, the goal is to try to persuade day-trippers to visit during quieter times.\n\n\"I think it's good, because it will perhaps slow down the numbers of tourists in Venice,\" said Sylvain Pelerin, a French tourist who has been visiting for more than 50 years.\n\nOvernight visitors, who already pay a tourist tax, minors under the age of 14 and others are exempt.\n\nBut some residents are strongly opposed to a measure they say curbs fundamental rights to freedom of movement.\n\nAround 300 people protested near the station on Thursday morning, holding up signs such as \"Stick it to the ticket!\" and \"Venice is not for sale!\"\n\n\"This is not a museum, it's not a protected ecological area, you shouldn't have to pay -- it's a city,\" Marina Dodino, from the local residents association ARCI, told AFP.\n\n- 'Soft controls' -\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has said the new scheme is \"an experiment\", monitored with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\".\n\nThere are no turnstiles or barriers, with inspectors instead carrying out checks at key entry points into the city.\n\nThey will be able to fine those without tickets, ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nBut an official told AFP none are expected on Thursday as authorities seek to persuade rather than punish.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as destinations around the world grapple with huge numbers of tourists, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming local communities and fragile sites.\n\nMore from this section The guardian angels of the source of the Seine Head of UN agency for Palestinians urges probe into staff killings Extreme heat scorches Southeast Asia, bringing school closures and warnings\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site in 1987.\n\nBut the numbers of people seeking to experience what the UN cultural body calls an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\" have become overwhelming.\n\nAt peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic centre of Venice, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nUNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\n- 'New balance' -\n\nAuthorities had already imposed a ban in 2021 on the massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nThe ticket idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\n\"The aim is to find a new balance between tourism and the city of its residents,\" Simone Venturini, the local councillor responsible for tourism, told AFP.\n\nHe hopes the initiative will persuade Italians living in the region to avoid busy days such as Thursday, a public holiday in Italy, marking the liberation from the Nazis and Fascism.\n\nBut Ashish Thakkar, an American tourist visiting Venice with his wife, questioned how much of an effect the day pass would have.\n\n\"If I'm coming all the way from out of the country, five euros just to get access to the city -- I wouldn't mind paying it,\" he told AFP.\n\nSome residents complain the measures fail to address another major issue -- the expansion of short-term lets through websites such as Airbnb, which are squeezing out long-term tenants.\n\nIn Florence, which also suffers from mass tourism, authorities have banned new short-term private holiday lets in the historic centre and offered tax breaks for landlords who switch back to ordinary leases.\n\n\"You have to start with the houses if you really want to solve the problem of tourism in Venice,\" said Federica Toninello, a local campaigner.\n\nglr-ar/imm", "source": {"uri":

tourist tax, minors under the age of 14 and others are exempt.\n\nBut some residents are strongly opposed to a measure they say curbs fundamental rights to freedom of movement.\n\nAround 300 people protested near the station on Thursday morning, holding up signs such as \"Stick it to the ticket!\" and \"Venice is not for sale!\"\n\n\"This is not a museum, it's not a protected ecological area, you shouldn't have to pay -- it's a city,\" Marina Dodino, from the local residents association ARCI, told AFP.\n\n- 'Soft controls' -\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has said the new scheme is \"an experiment\", monitored with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\".\n\nThere are no turnstiles or barriers, with inspectors instead carrying out checks at key entry points into the city.\n\nThey will be able to fine those without tickets, ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nBut an official told AFP none are expected on Thursday as authorities seek to persuade rather than punish.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as destinations around the world grapple with huge numbers of tourists, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming local communities and fragile sites.\n\nBut the numbers of people seeking to experience what the UN cultural body calls an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\" have become overwhelming.\n\nAt peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic centre of Venice, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nUNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\n- 'New balance' -\n\nAuthorities had already imposed a ban in 2021 on the massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nThe ticket idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\n\"The aim is to find a new balance between tourism and the city of its residents,\" Simone Venturini, the local councillor responsible for tourism, told AFP.\n\nSome residents complain the measures fail to address another major issue -- the expansion of short-term lets through websites such as Airbnb, which are squeezing out long-term tenants.\n\nIn Florence, which also suffers from mass tourism, authorities have banned new short-term private holiday lets in the historic centre and offered tax breaks for landlords who switch back to ordinary leases.\n\n\"You have to start with the houses if you really want to solve the problem of tourism in Venice,\" said Federica Toninello, a local campaigner.",

It also offered three years of tax breaks to landlords of short-term holiday lets if they start offering ordinary leases for residents.\n\nThe five villages that make up the Cinque Terre on the Italian Rivieria regularly get swamped with visitors.\n\nTo try to reduce the overcrowding at peak periods, the authority which oversees the area said this week it would charge visitors 15 euros to walk the most celebrated coastal path. People will also only be allowed to walk the path in one direction.\n\nThe picturesque small island of Capri has also doubled its entry fee, which is automatically added to ferry tickets. The fee is now five euros, and will be charged from April 1 to October 1.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, Amsterdam has introduced measures designed to help mitigate the impact of tourists on local residents. The Netherlands said its 'stay away' campaign led to a 22 per cent decline in British tourists last year, compared with 2019.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

'Yes to houses and services for all'\n\nCacciari noted in a statement to Adnkronos news agency that day visitors already pay 'three times as much as residents' for public transport in the city, and that travellers all contribute to the longevity of Venice's restaurants and museums.\n\nIn scathing remarks, he added that he would 'love to see' city authorities 'justify in a court the legitimacy of imposing a tax on entering the city'.\n\n'What are they going to do, block people's movement, send out the police to ask to see everyone's papers?\n\nDespite pleas from residents groups to rethink the scheme, Venice today become the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for day-tripper tourists, aimed at reducing the number of short-stay visitors who cause unmanageable congestion in peak times.\n\nThe so-called 'tourist tax' has been controversial, with several residents' committees and associations planning protests to coincide with the launch today in Italy.\n\nIndeed, large crowds gathered with colourful banners in marches against the move.\n\nReps argue the fee will not fix the fundamental issues but only cloud the city's public image.\n\nUnder the new rules, a fee will be charged to tourists passing through the city without staying overnight.\n\nAuthorities hope this might help manage the flow of some 30 million tourists drawn in by the city's history and romantic canals each year.\n\nThe scheme will be implemented only on the 29 busiest days of the calendar year between now and May 5, and on weekends until July 14 within certain time slots.\n\nThose who choose to stay in a hotel overnight will be exempted.\n\nResidents, commuters, students and children under 14 will also be let off the fee.\n\nBut from today, day-trippers will have to buy a ticket online that will provide them with a QR code, allowing them to appease stewards carrying out random checks with powers to issue fines ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300 for being caught without a code.\n\nPeople protest against the introduction of the fee in Venice, Italy, April 25, 2024\n\nA citizen shows a ticket with the writing 'Veniceland' during a protest against Venice Tax Fee in Venice, Italy, Thursday, April 25, 2024\n\nProtestors clash with riot police officers during a demonstration in Venice on April 25\n\nThe local council said 5,500 people had already booked a ticket for Thursday, bringing in \u20ac27,500 on the first day of the programme. They deny it is primarily a money-making initiative, however.\n\nSimone Venturini, the councillor in charge of tourism, defended the policy as part of a wider strategy trying to tackle the problems of overtourism, while admitting it was 'no magic wand'.\n\n'We want to discourage day-trippers from visiting Venice during these 29 designated days,' he said.\n\n'Fewer day trippers does not mean less revenue because overnight tourists are more important to the economy of the city.\n\n'We will see the results in the medium to long-term and in the meantime we will assess how it goes.'\n\nVenturini said previously the scheme aims to find 'a new balance between the rights of those who live, study or work in Venice and those who visit the city'.\n\nVenice's authorities have had a long wait to see the plan come to fruition, with initial proposals brought in 2019 set back by the pandemic.\n\nThe city also dropped plans to charge day-trippers \u20ac10 a day last year, with Venturini citing 'resistance'.\n\nOnce more, residents are turning out to slam the plan, arguing the move is affecting the city's image as an attractive destination for holidaymakers.\n\n'I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it,' suggested Matteo Secchi, who leads residents' activist group Venessia.com.\n\n'You can't impose an entrance fee to a city; all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice ... I mean, are we joking?'\n\nFederica Toninello, head of the ASC association for housing, suggested the council hadn't 'really understood the consequences' of mass tourism in Venice.\n\n'For a start, \u20ac5 will do nothing to deter people. But day trippers aren't the issue; things like the shortage of affordable housing are... What we need are policies to help residents, for example, making rules to limit things like Airbnb,' he said, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nWorkers prepare the tourist tax cashier desks outside the

The lagoon city of Venice begins a pilot program Thursday, April 25, 2024 to charge daytrippers a 5 euro entry fee that authorities hope will discourage tourists from arriving on peak days. Officials expect some 10,000 people will pay the fee [...]\n\nVENICE, Italy (AP) -- Under the gaze of the world's media, the fragile lagoon city of Venice launches a pilot program Thursday to charge day-trippers a 5-euro (around $5.35) entry fee that authorities hope will discourage visitors from arriving on peak days and make the city more livable for its dwindling residents.\n\nSigns advising arriving visitors of the new requirement for a test phase of 29 days through July have been erected outside the main train station and other points of arrival.\n\nSome 200 stewards have been trained to politely walk anyone unaware of the fee through the process of downloading a QR code. A kiosk has been set up for those not equipped with a smartphone. Once past designated entry ports, officials will carry out random checks for QR codes that show the day-tripper tax has been paid or that the bearer is exempt.\n\nTransgressors face fines 50 euros to 300 euros. The requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, but officials say that pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year -- including day-trippers -- are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon.\n\nBy contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16% from pre-pandemic highs.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, and say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should also get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiosk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marghera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Formats/Barcodes", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Formats/Barcodes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/preview-2098.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

(which) generates stress for the city,\", he said.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as destinations around the world grapple with huge numbers of tourists, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming local communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\n- UNESCO warning -\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site in 1987.\n\nBut the numbers of people seeking to experience what the UN cultural body calls an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\" are widely considered to be unsustainable.\n\nAt peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic centre of Venice, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nUNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nAshish Thakkar, an American tourist visiting on Wednesday with his wife, questioned how much of an effect the day pass would have.\n\n\"If I'm coming all the way from out of the country, five euros just to get access to the city -- I wouldn't mind paying it,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to make a big difference.\"\n\nVenturini hopes the initiative will persuade Italians living in the region not to come on busy days such as Thursday, when Italy marks its World War II Liberation Day.\n\nVenice had already imposed a ban in 2021 on the massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, acknowledged that the tickets were \"an experiment\", and officials are not entirely sure how the system is going to pan out.\n\n- No queues -\n\nEarlier this month, Brugnaro told reporters the new system would be monitored with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\".\n\nVisitors are being encouraged to buy their tickets online beforehand, but will be able to buy one on arrival.\n\nA new ticket office has been set up on the square in front of the Santa Lucia train station, the main point of entry into the city.\n\nControllers will carry out spot checks in key areas, with fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros ($53 to $320).\n\nTourists staying in Venice, who already pay an overnight tax for the privilege, are exempt from the new tickets, as are those arriving between 4:00 pm and 8:30 am, minors under 14 and the disabled.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of day tickets --

Instead, the goal is to highlight the busiest days and try to persuade day-trippers to choose other times.\n\n\"I think it's good, because it will perhaps slow down the numbers of tourists in Venice,\" said Sylvain Pelerin, a French tourist who has been visiting for more than 50 years.\n\nBut some residents are strongly opposed, and around 300 people protested near the Santa Lucia train station on Thursday morning, holding up signs such as \"Stick it to the ticket!\" and \"Venice is not for sale!\"\n\n\"This is not a museum, it's not a protected ecological area, you shouldn't have to pay -- it's a city,\" Marina Dodino, from the local residents' association ARCI, told AFP.\n\nIt is required only between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with overnight visitors -- who already pay a tourist tax -- and minors under the age of 14 exempt, among others.\n\nAround 113,000 people registered to enter Venice on Thursday, officials said, including 40,000 overnight visitors, 13,000 students, 20,000 workers and more than 4,000 friends or relatives of residents.\n\nResidents just need to show their identity documents. Brugnaro's office said checks by around 75 inspectors at more than a dozen control points had identified no major issues.\n\nThose without tickets face fines of 50 to 300 euros, though officials said they are seeking to persuade rather than punish.\n\n- UNESCO threat -\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched by other destinations grappling with mass tourism, which boosts the local economy but risks overwhelming local communities and fragile sites.\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site in 1987.\n\nBut at peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic centre, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nAuthorities banned cruise ships in 2021, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nBut UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon, which are attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\n- 'New balance' -\n\nThe ticket idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\n\"The aim is to find a new balance between tourism and the city of its residents,\" Simone Venturini, the local councillor responsible for tourism, told AFP.\n\nSome residents complain the measures fail to address another major issue -- the expansion of short-term apartment rentals through websites such as Airbnb, which are squeezing out long-term tenants.\n\n\"You have to start with the houses if you really want to solve the problem of tourism in Venice,\" said Federica Toninello, a local campaigner.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com",

The lagoon city of Venice begins a pilot program Thursday, April 25, 2024 to charge daytrippers a 5 euro entry fee that authorities hope will discourage tourists from arriving on peak days. Officials expect some 10,000 people will pay the fee to access the city on the first day, downloading a QR code to prove their payment.\n\nVENICE, Italy (AP) -- Under the gaze of the world's media, the fragile lagoon city of Venice launches a pilot program Thursday to charge day-trippers a 5-euro (around $5.35) entry fee that authorities hope will discourage visitors from arriving on peak days and make the city more livable for its dwindling residents.\n\nSigns advising arriving visitors of the new requirement for a test phase of 29 days through July have been erected outside the main train station and other points of arrival.\n\nSome 200 stewards have been trained to politely walk anyone unaware of the fee through the process of downloading a QR code. A kiosk has been set up for those not equipped with a smartphone. Once past designated entry ports, officials will carry out random checks for QR codes that show the day-tripper tax has been paid or that the bearer is exempt.\n\nTransgressors face fines 50 euros to 300 euros. The requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, but officials say that pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year -- including day-trippers -- are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon.\n\nBy contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16% from pre-pandemic highs.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, and say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should also get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.", "source":

'Yes to houses and services for all'\n\nCacciari noted in a statement to Adnkronos news agency that day visitors already pay 'three times as much as residents' for public transport in the city, and that travellers all contribute to the longevity of Venice's restaurants and museums.\n\nIn scathing remarks, he added that he would 'love to see' city authorities 'justify in a court the legitimacy of imposing a tax on entering the city'.\n\n'What are they going to do, block people's movement, send out the police to ask to see everyone's papers?\n\nDespite pleas from residents groups to rethink the scheme, Venice today become the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for day-tripper tourists, aimed at reducing the number of short-stay visitors who cause unmanageable congestion in peak times.\n\nThe so-called 'tourist tax' has been controversial, with several residents' committees and associations planning protests to coincide with the launch today in Italy.\n\nIndeed, large crowds gathered with colourful banners in marches against the move.\n\nReps argue the fee will not fix the fundamental issues but only cloud the city's public image.\n\nUnder the new rules, a fee will be charged to tourists passing through the city without staying overnight.\n\nAuthorities hope this might help manage the flow of some 30 million tourists drawn in by the city's history and romantic canals each year.\n\nThe scheme will be implemented only on the 29 busiest days of the calendar year between now and May 5, and on weekends until July 14 within certain time slots.\n\nThose who choose to stay in a hotel overnight will be exempted.\n\nResidents, commuters, students and children under 14 will also be let off the fee.\n\nBut from today, day-trippers will have to buy a ticket online that will provide them with a QR code, allowing them to appease stewards carrying out random checks with powers to issue fines ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300 for being caught without a code.\n\nPeople protest against the introduction of the fee in Venice, Italy, April 25, 2024\n\nA citizen shows a ticket with the writing 'Veniceland' during a protest against Venice Tax Fee in Venice, Italy, Thursday, April 25, 2024\n\nProtestors clash with riot police officers during a demonstration in Venice on April 25\n\nThe local council said 5,500 people had already booked a ticket for Thursday, bringing in \u20ac27,500 on the first day of the programme.

I mean, are we joking?'\n\nFederica Toninello, head of the ASC association for housing, suggested the council hadn't 'really understood the consequences' of mass tourism in Venice.\n\n'For a start, \u20ac5 will do nothing to deter people. But day trippers aren't the issue; things like the shortage of affordable housing are...

first European city to ban short-term private room rentals under 31 days.\n\nRome and Milan, two of Italy's most touristic cities, have also since sought the ability to restrict short-term room lets

(which) generates stress for the city,\" he said.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as destinations around the world grapple with huge numbers of tourists, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming local communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nOther European tourist hot spots, like Amsterdam and Barcelona, are on a campaign to deal with surging visitor numbers. Amsterdam also announced last week a ban on new hotels and that it would halve the number of river cruise ships in the city within five years.\n\nNestled on the coast of the Mediterranean, Barcelona, the home to famed Gaudi architectural gems and one of Spain's top football clubs made similar moves in the past.\n\nAda Colau, the leftist former housing rights activist who was mayor of the city between 2015 and June 2023, cracked down on illegal Airbnb rentals that were accused of pricing locals out of the property market.\n\nThe city also limited the entrance of tour groups in the historic La Boqueria market, especially during peak shopping times.\n\nAnd throughout the center organized groups must be limited to a maximum of 20 people and guides are not allowed to use loudspeakers.\n\nIn 2023 tourist numbers registering in hotels, homes and hostels were down 6.9% compared with 2019 figures, according to the City Council.\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site in 1987.\n\nHowever the number of people seeking to experience what the U.N. cultural body calls an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\" is widely considered to be unsustainable.\n\nAt peak times, 100,000 visitors stay overnight in the historic center of Venice, double the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nUNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism as well as rising water levels in its lagoon attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice escaped the ignominy only after local authorities agreed on the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nAshish Thakkar, an American tourist visiting on Wednesday with his wife, questioned how much of an effect the day pass would have.\n\n\"If I'm coming all the way from out of the country, 5 euros just to get access to the city - I wouldn't mind paying it,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to make a big difference.\"\n\nVenturini hopes the initiative will persuade Italians living in the region not to come on busy days such as Thursday when Italy marks its World War II Liberation Day.\n\nVenice had already imposed a ban in 2021 on the massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, acknowledged that the tickets were \"an experiment,\" and officials are not entirely sure how the system is going to pan out.\n\nEarlier this month, Brugnaro told reporters the new system would be monitored with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues.\"\n\nVisitors are being encouraged to buy their tickets online beforehand but will be able to buy one on arrival.\n\nA new ticket office has been set up on the square in front of the Santa Lucia train station, the main point of entry into the city.\n\nControllers will carry out spot checks in key areas, with fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nTourists staying in Venice, who already pay an overnight tax for the privilege, are exempt from the new tickets, as are those arriving between 4 p.m. and 8:30 a.m., minors under 14 and the disabled.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of day tickets - downloaded in the form of a QR code from a website (https://cda.ve.it/en/).", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@dailysabah.com",

But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cell phone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete. \"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism. Some say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.\n\nMarina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, is opposed to the new plan. She was passing out mock EU passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\nRodino has seen her local butcher close and families leave her neighborhood near the famed Rialto Bridge as short-term apartment rentals spring up. But she said the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for often rowdy gatherings.\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii,\" she said. \"It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen. That is what would counter this wild tourism.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Visitors arriving at Venice's main train station were greeted with large signs listing the 29 dates through July of the plan's test phase that also designated separate entrances for tourists, and residents, students and workers.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said Simone Venturini, the city's top tourism official. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nResidents protest, tourists left confused\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, insisting that only a resurgence in the population will restore balance to a city where narrow alleyways and water buses are often clogged with tourists.\n\nHundreds of Venetians protested against the programme, marching festively though the city's main bus terminal behind banners reading \"No to Tickets, Yes to Services and Housing.\" Protesters scuffled briefly with police with riot gear who blocked them from entering the city, before changing course and entering over another bridge escorted by plainclothes police. The demostration wrapped up peacefully in a piazza.\n\nTourists arriving at the main station encountered almost as many journalists as stewards on hand to politely guide anyone unaware of the new requirements through the process of downloading the QR code to pay the fee.\n\nArianna Cecilia, a tourist from Rome visiting Venice for the first time, said she thought it was \"strange\" to have to pay to enter a city in her native country, and be funneled through separate entrance ways for tourists. She and her boyfriend were staying in nearby Treviso, and so downloaded the QR code as required, but she was still caught off-guard while soaking in her first view ever of Venice's canals by the sight of the entrance signs and her boyfriend telling her to get out the ticket.\n\nThe how and why of the pilot programme\n\nOn the other side of the entrance ways, workers in yellow vests carried out random checks at the train station. Transgressors faces fines of 50 to 300 euros ($53 to $320), but officials said \"common sense\" was being applied for the launch.\n\nThe requirement applies only for people arriving between 08:30 and 16:00. Outside of those hours, access is free and unchecked.\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of overtourism, and officials hope that the pilot project can help provide more exact figures to better manage the phenomenon.\n\nThe city can track the number of hotel visitors, which last year numbered 4.6 million and is down 16 per cent from pre-pandemic highs. But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA smart control room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cellphone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete.\n\n\"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. On peak days, local police set up one-way traffic for pedestrians to keep the crowds moving.\n\nDoubts over efficacy of the programme\n\nResidents opposing the day-tripper tax insist that the solution to Venice's woes are to boost the resident population and the services they need, limiting short-term rentals to make available more housing and attract families back from the mainland.\n\nLast year, Venice passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organised a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park. You don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenice officials expected paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach about 10,000. More than 70,000 others had downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. Hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should provide a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nVenturini, the tourist official, said that interest in Venice's pilot programme has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities, and municipalities abroad such as Barcelona, Spain, and Amsterdam.\n\nBut Marina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, doesn't see the fee as the cure-all. Neighboring apartments in her residential building near the famed Rialto Bridge once inhabited by families are now short-term apartment rentals.\n\nThe corner butcher shop closed. Yet she noted that the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for the traditional aperitivo, which can grow rowdy.\n\nShe was passing out mock European Union passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian Constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii. It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen.

A kiosk has been set up for those not equipped with a smartphone. Once past designated entry ports, officials will carry out random checks for QR codes that show the day-tripper tax has been paid or that the bearer is exempt.\n\nTransgressors face fines 50 euros to 300 euros. The requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,\u00b4\u00b4 said the city\u00b4s top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, but officials say that pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year - including day-trippers - are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon.\n\nTourists arrive outside the main train station in Venice, Italy, Wednesday, April 24, 2024.

Officials expect some 10,000 people will pay the fee to access the city on the first day, downloading a QR code to prove their payment. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno)\n\nBy contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16% from pre-pandemic highs.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, and say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,\u00b4\u00b4 said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don\u00b4t pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should also get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.\n\nTourist information boards are seen outside the main train station in Venice, Italy, Wednesday, April 24, 2024.

Rather, it is a 'first-of-its-kind experiment' to regulate tourist flows in one of the world's most-visited places.\n\nThe aim of the charge is to incentivise visitors to avoid high-traffic periods and come on other days.\n\n\"Our attempt is to make a more liveable city,\" he said at a news conference outlining the pilot program.\n\nThe city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000, according to the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini.

They don't have to pay, however, since their hotel bill will already include a Venice lodging fee.\n\nAfter COVID-19 lockdowns devastated its tourism industry, Venice has been trying to rethink its relationship with visitors in a more sustainable way while also seeking to incentivise its residents to stay put.\n\nThe city has been forced to take action in response to the steady exodus of Venetians to the mainland.\n\nAfter pressure from UNESCO and environmentalists, authorities have finally banned big cruise ships from sailing past St Mark's Square and through the Giudecca canal.\n\nVenice has been pointing to longer-term tourists as key to its survival since they tend to spend more.\n\nBrugnaro said in no way does the new day-tripper contribution discourage tourism overall, but just seeks to manage it better.\n\nHe acknowledged the visitor program will probably have glitches and will need to be amended.

The demostration wrapped up peacefully in a piazza.\n\nTourists arriving at the main station encountered almost as many journalists as stewards on hand to politely guide anyone unaware of the new requirements through the process of downloading the QR code to pay the fee.\n\nArianna Cecilia, a tourist from Rome visiting Venice for the first time, said she thought it was \"strange\" to have to pay to enter a city in her native country, and be funneled through separate entrance ways for tourists. She and her boyfriend were staying in nearby Treviso, and so downloaded the QR code as required, but she was still caught off-guard while soaking in her first view ever of Venice's canals by the sight of the entrance signs and her boyfriend telling her to get out the ticket.\n\nStewards check tourists QR code access outside the main train station in Venice, Italy, Thursday, April 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno)\n\nOn the other side of the entrance ways, workers in yellow vests carried out random checks at the train station. Transgressors faces fines of 50 to 300 euros (US$53 to US$320), but officials said \"common sense\" was being applied for the launch.\n\nThe requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free and unchecked.\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of overtourism, and officials hope that the pilot project can help provide more exact figures to better manage the phenomenon.\n\nThe city can track the number of hotel visitors, which last year numbered 4.6 million and is down 16% from pre-pandemic highs. But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cellphone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete.\n\n\"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. On peak days, local police set up one-way traffic for pedestrians to keep the crowds moving.\n\nResidents opposing the day-tripper tax insist that the solution to Venice's woes are to boost the resident population and the services they need, limiting short-term rentals to make available more housing and attract families back from the mainland.\n\nLast year, Venice passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,\" said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park. You don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenice officials expected paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach about 10,000. More than 70,000 others had downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. Hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should provide a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nVenturini, the tourist official, said that interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities, and municipalities abroad such as Barcelona, Spain, and Amsterdam.\n\nBut Marina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, doesn't see the fee as the cure-all. Neighbouring apartments in her residential building near the famed Rialto Bridge once inhabited by families are now short-term apartment rentals.\n\nThe corner butcher shop closed. Yet she noted that the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for the traditional aperitivo, which can grow rowdy.\n\nShe was passing out mock European Union passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian Constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii. It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen. That is what would counter this wild tourism,\" Rodino said.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cell phone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete. \"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism. Some say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.\n\nMarina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, is opposed to the new plan. She was passing out mock EU passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\nRodino has seen her local butcher close and families leave her neighborhood near the famed Rialto Bridge as short-term apartment rentals spring up. But she said the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for often rowdy gatherings.\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii,\" she said. \"It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen. That is what would counter this wild tourism.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nMr Venturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals on Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region.\n\nPeople staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should also get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot programme has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiosk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marghera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/04/25/08/wire-84069151-1714029954-144_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The trial scheme starts on April 25 and will require tourists to pay a visitor's fee on 28 different days set between the end of April and mid-July.\n\nThe scheme's launch was repeatedly postponed in recent years.\n\n\"It's a great idea,\" says Kunz-Saponaro, who lives in Venice and works as a local tour guide. \"But it doesn't seem really well thought-out.\" She doubts the city's efforts to curb mass tourism will have much effect.\n\nThe problem is that a number of exceptions could undermine the new scheme. Residents of the wider Veneto region, for example, who visit Venice don't have to pay a fee. And it is completely unclear how city authorities intend to check that all day-trippers really have paid up. Officials have said, however, that inspectors will be out and about carrying out spot checks. Anyone caught without having paid the fee risks a fine of up to \u20ac300 ($319), they say.\n\nTour guide Kunz-Saponaro is most troubled by the fact that the scheme does not set a maximum number of tourists allowed to the city visit per day. After all, on average, around 80,000 holidaymakers stream into Venice every day, most of whom only spend a few hours before returning. It has been shown that day-trippers spend relatively little money in the city and crowd the city's narrow alleys.\n\n\"My hair stands on end at the thought of groups of tourists clogging up alleyways when I have to pass by with my shopping bags,\" Kunz-Saponaro told DW. \"The situation is hard to deal with.\"\n\nCity officials have been trying to get a handle on mass tourism in the city. \"We invite those who want to visit our city to experience Venice at a slow pace, and get a feel for the city,\" Venice's city councilor for tourism, Simone Venturini, told DW. Transforming Venice tourism will, however, take time, he concedes. Venturini said the city was introducing a visitor's fee in the hopes of encouraging tourists to stay overnight. Venice is the first city to take such a step and that adjustments would be made with time, added the city councilor.\n\nVenice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro recently told daily Corriere della Sera the city will remain open to visitors without a cap on how many people are allowed to visit any given day. He added that the fee may, however, have a psychological effect, by deterring some tourists. \"Venice must be suited to those who live there and those who visit,\" Brugnaro said. \"But on certain days with particularly high visitor numbers, there is a risk this is not the case.\"\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, Venice was visited by five million tourists every year. A similar figure is expected for this year.\n\nVenice residents and lawmakers have complained about rude visitors lacking common decency in recent years. City officials have drawn up a list of rules to encourage better manners. Among other things, it is forbidden to sit on Venice bridges and stairs, jump into the canal, walk through the city in swimwear, feed pigeons or litter. Anyone breaking these rules could face fines of up to \u20ac500 ($531).\n\nThere is no data on how often holidaymakers are fined, according to city administrators, who say raising money is not the primary objective. They say the purpose of the visitor's fee is not to generate cash, though expect it could contribute around \u20ac700,000 ($743,750) to city coffers this year. This money, along with revenue generated from overnight stay taxes, will be used to clean streets and improve touristic offerings, city officials say.\n\nHolidaymakers staying in Venice accommodation need to pay a nightly fee of between \u20ac1 and \u20ac5 per night, depending on the hotel category and time of year. Last year, the city made \u20ac34 million ($36 million) from this tax alone.\n\nThat's not all. As of August 1, new rules will also apply to guided city tours. Tourist groups may exceed no more than 25 people. In addition, greater care will be taken to ensure that locals are not bothered by tourists blocking alleyways as they listen to tour guides.\n\nLocal guide Kunz-Saponaro, however, thinks this new regulation does not go far enough and would prefer a limit of no more than 20 tourists at any given time. She mainly shows smaller groups around Venice and concedes that \"tourism is important for the city.\" That said, making money should not be the number one objective, according to Kunz-Saponaro. \"The people who live in Venice must be able to cope with city tourism.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/67300886_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 253, "textEnd": 261}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 3946, "textEnd": 3954}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The demostration wrapped up peacefully in a piazza.\n\nTourists arriving at the main station encountered almost as many journalists as stewards on hand to politely guide anyone unaware of the new requirements through the process of downloading the QR code to pay the fee.\n\nArianna Cecilia, a tourist from Rome visiting Venice for the first time, said she thought it was \"strange\" to have to pay to enter a city in her native country, and be funneled through separate entrance ways for tourists. She and her boyfriend were staying in nearby Treviso, and so downloaded the QR code as required, but she was still caught off-guard while soaking in her first view ever of Venice's canals by the sight of the entrance signs and her boyfriend telling her to get out the ticket.\n\nOn the other side of the entrance ways, workers in yellow vests carried out random checks at the train station. Transgressors faces fines of 50 to 300 euros ($53 to $320), but officials said \"common sense\" was being applied for the launch.\n\nThe requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free and unchecked.\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of overtourism, and officials hope that the pilot project can help provide more exact figures to better manage the phenomenon.\n\nThe city can track the number of hotel visitors, which last year numbered 4.6 million and is down 16% from pre-pandemic highs. But the number of day visitors, which make up the majority of the crowds in Venice, could only be estimated until recently.\n\nA Smart Control Room set up during the pandemic has been tracking arrivals from cellphone data, roughly confirming pre-pandemic estimates of 25 million to 30 million arrivals a year, said Michele Zuin, the city's top economic official. That includes both day-trippers and overnight guests.\n\nBut Zuin said the data is incomplete.\n\n\"It's clear we will get more reliable data from the contribution\" being paid by day-trippers, he said.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. On peak days, local police set up one-way traffic for pedestrians to keep the crowds moving.\n\nResidents opposing the day-tripper tax insist that the solution to Venice's woes are to boost the resident population and the services they need, limiting short-term rentals to make available more housing and attract families back from the mainland.\n\nLast year, Venice passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park. You don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenice officials expected paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach about 10,000. More than 70,000 others had downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. Hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should provide a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nVenturini, the tourist official, said that interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities, and municipalities abroad such as Barcelona, Spain, and Amsterdam.\n\nBut Marina Rodino, who has lived in Venice for 30 years, doesn't see the fee as the cure-all. Neighboring apartments in her residential building near the famed Rialto Bridge once inhabited by families are now short-term apartment rentals.\n\nThe corner butcher shop closed. Yet she noted that the new entrance fee requirement will still allow young people to flood the city in the evening for the traditional aperitivo, which can grow rowdy.\n\nShe was passing out mock European Union passports for \"Venice, Open City,\" underlining the irony of the new system, and challenging its legal standing with citations from the Italian Constitution guaranteeing its citizens the right to \"move or reside freely in any part of the national territory.\"\n\n\"This is not a natural oasis. This is not a museum. It is not Pompeii. It is a city, where we need to fight so the houses are inhabited by families, and stores reopen.

Will it work?\n\nThis year, the Italian city of Venice will begin charging a \u20ac5 ($5.30) fee for day-trippers who are not staying overnight. The trial scheme starts on April 25 and will require tourists to pay a visitor's fee on numerous different days between the end of April and mid-July.\n\nThe scheme's launch was repeatedly postponed in recent years.\n\n\"It's a great idea,\" says Susanne Kunz-Saponaro, who lives in Venice and works as a local tour guide. \"But it doesn't seem really well thought-out.\" She doubts the city's efforts to curb mass tourism will have much effect.\n\nThe problem is that a number of exceptions could undermine the new scheme.\n\nResidents of the wider Veneto region, for example, who visit Venice don't have to pay a fee. And it is completely unclear how city authorities intend to check that all day-trippers really have paid up. Officials have said, however, that inspectors will be out and about carrying out spot checks. Anyone caught without having paid the fee risks a fine of up to \u20ac300, they say.\n\nTour guide Kunz-Saponaro is most troubled by the fact that the scheme does not set a maximum number of tourists allowed to the city visit per day. After all, on average, around 80,000 holidaymakers stream into Venice every day, most of whom only spend a few hours before returning. It has been shown that day-trippers spend relatively little money in the city and crowd the city's narrow alleys.\n\n\"My hair stands on end at the thought of groups of tourists clogging up alleyways when I have to pass by with my shopping bags,\" Kunz-Saponaro told DW. \"The situation is hard to deal with.\"\n\nCity officials have been trying to get a handle on mass tourism in the city.\n\n\"We invite those who want to visit our city to experience Venice at a slow pace and get a feel for the city,\" Venice's city councilor for tourism, Simone Venturini, told DW. Transforming Venice tourism will, however, take time, he concedes. Venturini said the city was introducing a visitor's fee to encourage tourists to stay overnight. Venice is the first city to take such a step, and adjustments would be made with time, added the city councilor.\n\nVenice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro recently told the daily Corriere della Sera that the city will remain open to visitors without a cap on how many people are allowed to visit any given day. He added that the fee may, however, have a psychological effect by deterring some tourists.\n\n\"Venice must be suited to those who live there and those who visit,\" Brugnaro said. \"But on certain days with particularly high visitor numbers, there is a risk this is not the case.\"\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, five million tourists visited Venice every year. A similar figure is expected for this year.\n\nIn recent years, Venice residents and lawmakers have complained about rude visitors lacking common decency. City officials have drawn up a list of rules to encourage better manners. Among other things, it is forbidden to sit on Venice bridges and stairs, jump into the canal, walk through the city in swimwear, feed pigeons or litter. Anyone breaking these rules could face fines of up to \u20ac500.\n\nAccording to city administrators, there is no data on how often holidaymakers are fined, who say raising money is not the primary objective. They say the purpose of the visitor's fee is not to generate cash, though expect it could contribute around \u20ac700,000 to city coffers this year. City officials say this money and revenue generated from overnight stay taxes will be used to clean streets and improve touristic offerings.\n\nHolidaymakers staying in Venice accommodation need to pay a nightly fee of between \u20ac1 and \u20ac5 per night, depending on the hotel category and time of year. Last year, the city made \u20ac34 million from this tax alone.\n\nThat's not all. As of August 1, new rules will also apply to guided city tours. Tourist groups may exceed no more than 25 people. In addition, greater care will be taken to ensure that locals are not bothered by tourists blocking alleyways as they listen to tour guides.\n\nLocal guide Kunz-Saponaro, however, thinks this new regulation does not go far enough and would prefer a limit of no more than 20 tourists at any given time. She mainly shows smaller groups around Venice and concedes that \"tourism is important for the city.\"\n\nThat said, making money should not be the number one objective, according to Kunz-Saponaro. \"The people who live in Venice must be able to cope with city tourism.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tour guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/67300886_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 274, "textEnd": 282}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 3913, "textEnd": 3921}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

begin charging day trippers for entry, a world first aimed at easing pressure on the Italian city drowning under the weight of mass tourism.\n\nOn Thursday -- a public holiday in Italy -- day visitors will for the first time have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, monitored by inspectors carrying out spot checks at key points in the UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nVenice is one of the world's top tourist destinations, with 3.2 million visitors staying overnight in the historic centre in 2022 -- dwarfing the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nThe aim of the tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds.\n\nInitially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nBut the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nIn Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\n- UNESCO warning -\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities.\n\nThe UN cultural body UNESCO listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\".\n\nBut UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to UNESCO that would not have any impact.\n\n\"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nIt has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\n- No queues -\n\nVenice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nControllers will be stationed in and around the city's main entrances, notably the Santa Lucia train station, performing spot checks on visitors.\n\nTourists without their ticket will be invited to purchase one on arrival, with the help of local operators.\n\nBut they could also risk fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" targets only daily tourists entering the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with tourists staying in hotels, minors under 14, and the disabled among those exempt.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of tickets -- downloaded in the form of a QR code from a website (https://cda.ve.it/en/), distributed each day.", "source":

dwarfing the city's population of 49,000.\n\nVenice narrowly escaped being placed on Unesco's \"World Heritage in Danger\" list last year partly because the city was addressing concerns that its ecosystem risked being overwhelmed by tourism.\n\nAs well as introducing the entry charge, the city has also banned large cruise ships and announced limits on the size of tourist groups.\n\nSimone Venturini, the council official responsible for tourism and social cohesion, said: \"The phenomenon of mass tourism poses a challenge for all Europe's tourist cities.\n\n\"But being smaller and more fragile, [Venice] is even more impacted by this phenomenon and is therefore taking action earlier than others to try to find solutions.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(Venice)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Canal (Venice)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4_OAYy0TFotrnYsfq5Uf2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/bf77e7afad0c5744a88cd4d4686a0a3f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1686, "textEnd": 1694}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Visitors under the age of 14 will also be exempt. But like the day-trippers they will also have to ensure they have registered online and received a QR code.\n\nThose without smartphones will have to go to the city's Santa Lucia train station to buy a ticket.\n\nAmong the thousands of people lining up at the station for a ticket Thursday was Donna Porter-Mutchler, a tourist from Tennessee, who told NBC News she thought the charge was \"a wonderful idea.\"\n\n\"Venice deserves to be taken care of,\" said Mutchler. \"I think it's more than worth it. I come here often and I'll pay every time.\"\n\nWhile there will be no limits on the number of people who can register, officials are hoping the fee will put people off on days that it applies.\n\n\"We are not looking to collect money, tax people or introduce a police state,\" Simone Venturini, Venice's tourism councilor, told NBC News. \"We are being democratic about it, but the important message is: 'please, if you are a day-tripper, choose another day.'\"\n\nWhile there are no turnstiles at the city's entrance points to make sure people have a pass, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between 50 and 300 euros to anyone who has failed to register.\n\nProminent signs across the city and a TV and newspaper advertising campaign has been launched in Italy and some other countries to let people know about it. And with the help of artificial intelligence, Venice's Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has also recorded a video message in several languages to inform tourists about the charge.\n\nOfficials in the city estimate an average of about 50,000 people a day visit Venice, an influx which almost matches the resident population of the city, some of whom are unhappy about the new charge.\n\n\"Venice has turned into Disneyland, where tourists are catered more than residents, and charging $5 is not going to stop anyone,\" Federica Toninello of the Social Assembly for Housing and the Solidarity Network for Housing in Venice, said Thursday. \"It's just propaganda.\"\n\nOthers like tourist guide Luisella Romeo, said they were concerned about the use of personal data collected by the new system. \"That's an invasion of privacy.

UNESCO's \"World Heritage in Danger\" list last year, in part because the United Nations body decided that it was not addressing concerns that its delicate ecosystem risked being overwhelmed by mass tourism, have insisted that something needed to be done.\n\nThree years ago, large cruise ships were banned from sailing into the Venetian lagoon and the city has also announced limits on the size of

A kiosk has been set up for those not equipped with a smartphone. Once past designated entry ports, officials will carry out random checks for QR codes that show the day-tripper tax has been paid or that the bearer is exempt.\n\nTransgressors face fines 50 euros to 300 euros. The requirement applies only for people arriving between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, access is free.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,'' said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, but officials say that pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year -- including day-trippers -- are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon.\n\nBy contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16% from pre-pandemic highs.\n\nVenturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, and say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic center with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organized a protest Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nVenturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals Thursday to reach some 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region. People staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should also get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax.\n\nThe tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot program has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colleen_barry@yahoo.com", "name": "Colleen Barry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiosk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marghera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Standards_and_Codes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Standards and Codes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Formats/Barcodes", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Formats/Barcodes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VTwI083eCBjxsrWkCHi48g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/6d66a713077eea22e188a97d3d17320e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nThe aim of the tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds.\n\nREAD ALSO: EXPLAINED: How will Venice's 'tourist tax' work?\n\nInitially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nBut the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nIn Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nREAD ALSO: What's the difference between Italy's city taxes and new 'tourist tax'?\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities.\n\nThe UN cultural body UNESCO listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\".\n\nBut UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nREAD ALSO: 'It's not Disneyland': What Venice residents really think of new 'tourist tax'\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to UNESCO that would not have any impact.\n\n\"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nIt has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\nVenice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nControllers will be stationed in and around the city's main entrances, notably the Santa Lucia train station, performing spot checks on visitors.\n\nTourists without their ticket will be invited to purchase one on arrival, with the help of local operators.\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" targets only daily tourists entering the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with tourists staying

The \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30) charge, which comes into force today, is aimed at protecting the Unesco world heritage site from the effects of excessive tourism by deterring day trippers and, according to the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, making the city \"livable\" again.\n\nBut several residents' committees and associations have planned protests for Thursday, arguing that the fee will do nothing to resolve the issue.\n\n\"I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it,\" claimed Matteo Secchi, who leads Venessia.com, a residents' activist group. \"You can't impose an entrance fee to a city; all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice ... I mean, are we joking?\"\n\nOnce the heart of a powerful maritime republic, Venice's main island has lost more than 120,000 residents since the early 1950s, driven away by a number of issues but predominantly a focus on mass tourism that has caused the population to be dwarfed by the thousands of visitors who crowd its squares, bridges and narrow walkways at the busiest times of the year.\n\nThe entrance fee, which is required only for access to Venice's historic centre, is bookable online and will apply on 29 peak days, mostly weekends, from Thursday until 14 July as part of its trial phase.\n\nResidents, commuters, students and children under the age of 14 are exempt, as are tourists who stay overnight.\n\nDay trippers, however, will be required to buy their ticket online and will then be provided with a QR code. Those without one will be able to buy a ticket on arrival, with the help of local stewards, who will also carry out random checks at five main arrival points including Santa Lucia train station. Those without a ticket risk fines of between \u20ac50 and \u20ac300.\n\nRelated: Venice access fee: what is it and how much does it cost?\n\nVenice council said 5,500 people had booked a ticket for 25 April, a national holiday in Italy, bringing \u20ac27,500 to the city's coffers on its first day. Although Brugnaro has denied it is a money-making initiative, he has promised to cut local taxes for residents if the scheme is successful.\n\nFederica Toninello, who leads ASC, an association for housing, said: \"They think this measure will solve the problem, but they haven't really understood the consequences of mass tourism on a city like Venice.\n\n\"For a start, \u20ac5 will do nothing to deter people. But day trippers aren't the issue; things like the shortage of affordable housing are ... What we need are policies to help residents, for example, making rules to limit things like Airbnb.\"\n\nThe local branch of Arci, a cultural and social rights association, said it would distribute \"symbolic passports\" to tourists on Thursday as a way of highlighting the \"dubious constitutional legitimacy\" of the measure in terms of restricting free movement. The fee, it added, would be \"ineffective in containing mass tourism\" while generating \"unequal treatment between different categories of visitors\".\n\nOthers, however, have embraced the scheme. \"It will serve to collect fundamental data and help regulate tourist flows, which during certain periods of the year risking damaging a fragile city like Venice,\" Tommaso Sichero, the president of the association for Venice shop owners, told Avvenire newspaper.\n\nDespite the criticism, the Venice tourism councillor Simone Venturini said the administration was feeling \"very relaxed\" about \"the \"adventure\". \"For the first time since Venice affixed itself to mass tourism, we are trying to do something,\" he said. \"This is the most relevant point.\"\n\nWhile some have raised questions over privacy due to people having to feed their data into the booking system, Venturini said the tool would be useful in \"providing more precise figures on visitor numbers\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_republics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maritime republics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avvenire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avvenire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/eb681efa2cd7a3a8634cfb4f359a1b05", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-14", "textStart": 1464, "textEnd": 1471}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2106, "textEnd": 2114}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Signs were set up outside the train station and near an entry footbridge warning visitors they had to pay the new 5-euro ($5.35) charge before diving into Venice's narrow alleyways.\n\nSimone Venturini, the city councillor responsible for tourism and social cohesion, said the scheme would help Venice find \"a new balance\" between residents and day-trippers, but hundreds of local protesters saw things differently. \"We are against this measure because it will do nothing to stop overtourism,\" said resident Cristina Romieri. \"Moreover, it is such a complex regulation with so many exceptions that it will also be difficult to enforce it.\"\n\nGiovanni Andrea Martini, a member of an opposition group in the Town Hall who joined the residents' protests, called it \"a sad day because Venice is becoming a museum, a theme park.\" Holding banners reading \"No to ticket for Vene-Land\" and chanting \"Here we live and here we stay\", a few hundred people peacefully marched through one of Venice's main squares to express their opposition to the new measure.\n\nApril 25 is a national holiday in Italy and is the first of 29 days this year when people must buy a ticket if they want to access the lagoon city from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. Reservations are meant to be made online but there is also a booth on hand for those who don't have smartphones.\n\nAlthough there are no turnstiles at the city gateways, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between 50 and 300 euros to anyone who has failed to register. However, Italian tourists arriving on Thursday said imposing another charge on visitors was unfair.\n\n\"I consider Venice to be the most beautiful city in the world and so to deprive a person on a low budget of the opportunity to come here for an hour or two to enjoy this city is surely a shame for these tourists,\" said Gabriella Pappada, who came from Lecce in southern Italy. The initiative is one of a\n\nseries of measures in place across Italy to manage tourist flows.\n\nSome 20 million people visited Venice last year, a city official said, with roughly half of them staying overnight in hotels or holiday lets - an influx which dwarfs the resident population currently put at around 49,000. People with hotel reservations and visitors aged under 14 do not need to pay the entry fee, but still need to register beforehand. Residents, students and workers are exempt.\n\nVenice narrowly escaped being placed on UNESCO's \"World Heritage in Danger\" list last year partly because the U.N. body decided the city was addressing concerns that its delicate ecosystem risked being overwhelmed by mass tourism. Besides introducing the entry charge, the city has also banned large cruise ships from sailing into the Venetian lagoon and has announced new limits on the size of tourist groups.

Authorities in Venice are trialling the \u20ac5 charge on 29 specific dates this spring and summer, with holidaymakers facing a fine of up to \u20ac257 if they fail to pay.\n\nAuthorities say the aim is to reduce crowding during the busiest periods and make the city more liveable for residents. Signs advising arriving visitors of the new requirement during the test phase have been erected outside the city's main train station and other points of arrival.\n\nThe first day of the trial period begins today (April 25), with the full list of dates outlined below. Some 200 stewards have been trained to politely walk anyone unaware of the five euro (\u00a34.28) fee through the process of downloading a QR code.\n\nRead more: New Canary Islands rules for Brits after protests and anti-tourist graffiti\n\nRead more: 'Gateway to the Med' holiday destination where Brits are welcome\n\nA kiosk has been set up for those not equipped with a smartphone. Once past designated entry ports, officials will carry out random checks for QR codes that show the day-tripper tax has been paid or that the bearer is exempt.\n\nTransgressors face fines of 50-300 euros (\u00a353-\u00a3257). The requirement applies only for people arriving between 8.30am and 4pm. Outside of those hours, access is free.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,\" said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nAccording to information shared by the Comune di Venezia, the city's officials, these are the dates in 2024 when the fee will be required:\n\nTranslated information for tourists on the Comune's website states: \"Entry to the city of Venice is subject to payment of an access fee, unless the visitor falls into one of the categories that entitle them to exemption from payment.\n\n\"The access fee is not charged from 4p.m. to 8.30am. Registering and obtaining the appropriate exemption voucher is required to benefit from the exemption.\n\n\"Residents of the Municipality of Venice and individuals born in the Municipality of Venice are excluded from paying the access fee: they are not required to obtain the exemption voucher and can prove their exemption status by presenting a document certifying it.\n\n\"Minors under the age of 14 are excluded from the payment of the access fee: to prove their age, if it is not apparent, the presentation of an identity document is accepted as sufficient proof.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, but officials say that pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year -- including day-trippers -- are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon.\n\nBy contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16 per cent from pre-pandemic highs. Mr Venturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000.\n\nIts narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business. Not all residents, however, are persuaded by the new system in dissuading mass tourism, and say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic centre with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,\" said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organised a protest on Thursday against the measure.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nMr Venturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals today (Thursday) to reach some 10,000.

Venice to trial day tickets", "body": "Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as 'an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world'\n\nVenice will this week begin charging day trippers for entry, a world first aimed at easing pressure on the Italian city drowning under the weight of mass tourism.\n\nOn Thursday -- a public holiday in Italy -- day visitors will for the first time have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, monitored by inspectors carrying out spot checks at key points in the UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nVenice is one of the world's top tourist destinations, with 3.2 million visitors staying overnight in the historic centre in 2022 -- dwarfing the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nThe aim of the tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds.\n\nInitially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nBut the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nIn Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\n- UNESCO warning -\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities.\n\nThe UN cultural body UNESCO listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\".\n\nBut UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to UNESCO that would not have any impact.\n\n\"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nIt has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\n- No queues -\n\nVenice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nControllers will be stationed in and around the city's main entrances, notably the Santa Lucia train station, performing spot checks on visitors.\n\nTourists without their ticket will be invited to purchase one on arrival, with the help of local operators.\n\nBut they could also risk fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" targets only daily tourists entering the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with tourists staying in hotels, minors under 14, and the disabled among those exempt.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of tickets -- downloaded in the form of a QR code from a website (https://cda.ve.it/en/), distributed each day.\n\nglr-ar/ide/ach\n\nMore from this section\n\nZQdropshipping Launches Professional Dropshipping Services Facilitating Effortless E-Commerce Operations EnergyCAP earns 2024 Environment+Energy

Some confronted police officers during a demonstration in Piazzale Roma.\n\nSigns were set up outside the train station and near an entry footbridge warning visitors they had to pay the new five-euro charge before diving into Venice's famous alleyways.\n\nSimone Venturini, the city councillor responsible for tourism and social cohesion, said the scheme would help Venice find \"a new balance\" between residents and day-trippers, but hundreds of local protesters saw things differently.\n\n\"We are against this measure because it will do nothing to stop overtourism,\" said resident Cristina Romieri. \"Moreover, it is such a complex regulation with so many exceptions that it will also be difficult to enforce it.\"\n\nGiovanni Andrea Martini, a member of an opposition group in the Town Hall who joined the residents' protests, called it \"a sad day because Venice is becoming a museum, a theme park.\"\n\nHolding banners reading \"No to ticket for Vene-Land\" and chanting \"Here we live and here we stay\", a few hundred people marched through one of Venice's main squares to express their opposition to the new measure.\n\nApril 25 is a national holiday in Italy and is the first of 29 days this year when people must buy a ticket if they want to access the lagoon city from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.\n\nReservations are meant to be made online but there is also a booth on hand for those who don't have smartphones.\n\nAlthough there are no turnstiles at the city gateways, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between 50 and 300 euros to anyone who has failed to register.\n\nItalian tourists arriving on Thursday said imposing another charge on visitors was unfair.\n\n\"I consider Venice to be the most beautiful city in the world and so to deprive a person on a low budget of the opportunity to come here for an hour or two to enjoy this city is surely a shame for these tourists,\" said Gabriella Pappada, who came from Lecce in southern Italy.\n\nThe initiative is one of a series of measures in place across Italy to manage tourist flows.\n\nFlorence announced in October it was banning new short-term residential lets on platforms such as Airbnb in its historic centre. It also offered three years of tax breaks to landlords of short-term holiday lets if they start offering ordinary leases for residents.\n\nSome 20 million people visited Venice last year, a city official said, with roughly half of them staying overnight in hotels or holiday lets - an influx which dwarfs the resident population currently put at around 49,000.\n\nPeople with hotel reservations and visitors aged under 14 do not need to pay the entry fee, but still need to register beforehand. Residents, students and workers are exempt.\n\nVenice narrowly escaped being placed on UNESCO's \"World Heritage in Danger\" list last year partly because the U.N. body decided the city was addressing concerns that its delicate ecosystem risked being overwhelmed by mass tourism.\n\nBesides introducing the entry charge, the city has also banned large cruise ships from sailing into the Venetian lagoon and has announced new limits on the size of tourist groups.\n\nOther cities, such as Como, have said they are considering introducing a similar measure, but are waiting to see how the Venice initiative works before deciding.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice",

city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nThe aim of the tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds.\n\nInitially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nBut the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nIn Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\n- UNESCO warning -\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities.\n\nThe UN cultural body UNESCO listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\".\n\nBut UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nMore from this section Doner diplomacy: German president

bout\n\nVenice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to UNESCO that would not have any impact.\n\n\"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nIt has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\n- No queues -\n\nVenice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nControllers will be stationed in and around the city's main entrances, notably the Santa Lucia train station, performing spot checks on visitors.\n\nTourists without their ticket will be invited to purchase one on arrival, with the help of local operators.\n\nBut they could also risk fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" targets only daily tourists entering the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with tourists staying in hotels, minors under 14, and the disabled among those exempt.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of tickets -- downloaded in the form of a QR code from a website (https://cda.ve.it/en/), distributed each day.\n\nglr-ar/ide/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Not everyone is happy, however.\n\nVisitors to Venice are being charged to enter the Italian city from today, under a controversial scheme.\n\nAuthorities say the pilot programme is designed to discourage tourists from arriving on peak days and make the city more liveable for residents.\n\nSigns advising arriving visitors of the new \u20ac5 fee (\u00a34.28) during a test phase of 29 days through July have been put up outside the main train station and other points of entry.\n\nAround 200 stewards have been trained to politely walk anyone unaware of the charge through the process of downloading a QR code - with a kiosk set up for anyone not equipped with a smartphone.\n\nOfficials will carry out random checks on people beyond the entry ports from 8.30am to 4pm, to make sure people have either paid the day-tripper tax or are exempt.\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,\" said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini.\n\n\"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered from the pressures of over-tourism. Many come to see a World Heritage Site famous the world over for its medieval architecture crammed into a picturesque canal network.\n\nOfficials say pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year - including day-trippers - are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon.\n\nIn contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16% from pre-pandemic highs.\n\nMr Venturini said the city was strained when the number of day-trippers reached 30,000 to 40,000 - leaving its narrow alleyways clogged with people and water taxis packed, causing problems for residents in their everyday lives.\n\nHowever, some residents are unconvinced as to whether the plan will succeed in preventing mass tourism.\n\nSome say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need.\n\nVenice passed a milestone last year when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, who now number less than 50,000 in the historic centre.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,\" said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organised a protest against the measures today.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice.\"\n\nBut Mr Venturini said around 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, with officials expecting paid day-tripper arrivals today to reach about 10,000.\n\nMore than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region.\n\nAnd, Mr Venturini indicated, Venice may not be the last major European city to introduce a charge for people to enter.\n\nHe said the pilot programme was being closely watched by other places suffering from mass tourism - including other Italian art cities and weekend-break hotspots Barcelona and Amsterdam.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiosk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/04/1600x900/skynews-money-blog-venice-tourism_6524208.jpg?20240417122934", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Reps argue the fee will not fix the fundamental issues but only cloud the city's public image.\n\nTourists are pictured as they sit on an abandoned armchair on a pier in Venice, Italy, Wednesday, April 24, 2024\n\nWorkers prepare the tourist tax cashier desks outside the main train station in Venice, Italy, Wednesday, April 24, 2024\n\nUnder the new rules, a fee will be charged to tourists passing through the city without staying overnight.\n\nAuthorities hope this might help manage the flow of some 30 million tourists drawn in by the city's history and romantic canals each year.\n\nThe scheme will be implemented only on the 29 busiest days of the calendar year between now and July, and those who choose to stay in a hotel overnight will be exempted.\n\nResidents, commuters, students and children under 14 will also be let off the fee.\n\nBut from today, day-trippers will have to buy a ticket online that will provide them with a QR code. Stewards will be carrying out random checks to ensure cooperation, with power to issue fines ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300 for being caught without a code.\n\nThe local council said 5,500 people had already booked a ticket for Thursday, bringing in \u20ac27,500 on the first day of the programme. They deny it is primarily a money-making initiative, however.\n\nSimone Venturini, the councillor in charge of tourism, defended the policy as part of a wider strategy trying to tackle the problems of overtourism, while admitting it was 'no magic wand'.\n\n'We want to discourage day-trippers from visiting Venice during these 29 designated days,' he said.\n\n'Fewer day trippers does not mean less revenue because overnight tourists are more important to the economy of the city.\n\n'We will see the results in the medium to long-term and in the meantime we will assess how it goes.'\n\nVenturini said previously the scheme aims to find 'a new balance between the rights of those who live, study or work in Venice and those who visit the city'.\n\nVenice's authorities have had a long wait to see the plan come to fruition, with initial proposals brought in 2019 set back by the pandemic.\n\nThe city also dropped plans to charge day-trippers \u20ac10 a day last year, with Venturini citing 'resistance'.\n\nOnce more, residents are turning out to slam the plan, arguing the move is affecting the city's image as an attractive destination for holidaymakers.\n\n'I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it,' suggested Matteo Secchi, who leads residents' activist group Venessia.com.\n\n'You can't impose an entrance fee to a city; all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice ... I mean, are we joking?'\n\nFederica Toninello, head of the ASC association for housing, suggested the council hadn't 'really understood the consequences' of mass tourism in Venice.\n\n'For a start, \u20ac5 will do nothing to deter people. But day trippers aren't the issue; things like the shortage of affordable housing are... What we need are policies to help residents, for example, making rules to limit things like Airbnb,' he said, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nTourists arrive outside the main train station in Venice,

available housing and makes homes more expensive for residents.\n\nBarcelona has faced a similar problem and, in 2021, set precedent by becoming the first European city to ban short-term private room rentals under 31 days.\n\nRome and Milan, two of Italy's most touristic cities, have also since sought the ability to restrict short-term room lets as rents rise and salaries flatline.\n\nVenetians also have concerns that short-term visitors spend less than tourists who rent rooms or book out hotels for several days.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

The new fee came into force on April 25, a national holiday in Italy.\n\nMunicipal workers were seen checking the tickets of day-trippers outside the front of the fragile lagoon city's Santa Lucia railway station. Signs had been erected to warn tourists about the payment program.\n\nThe charge applies to tourists arriving between 8:30 a.m. local time and 4 p.m., while access is free outside of those hours. Day-trippers who fail to pay the fee face fines between 50 euros to 300 euros.\n\nOvernight travelers who stay within the municipality of Venice are exempt from the charge, but must have a QR code to pass through the gates located at the main access points of the city. A booth was set up for visitors without access to a smartphone, Reuters reported.\n\nVenice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said on social media earlier in the week that Venice would be the first major city to experiment with the payment program, \"although overtourism is not a problem that only concerns this city.\"\n\n\"Through this measure we want to improve the quality of life in #Venezia, we want to make it safer, cleaner and with more services, in order to guarantee citizens and visitors peace of mind,\" Brugnaro said Tuesday in a Google-translated post on social media platform X.\n\n\"With courage and a smile, we want to give a future to Venice, which tomorrow will be in the hands of our children.

Authorities hope the charge will deter tourists from arriving in the city during busy periods.\n\nThe scheme will initially be tested across 29 days from today, April 25 - a public holiday in Italy - until July. Initially it will be in place for 11 days from April 25, followed by seven weekends, until (and including) Sunday July 14. After that the charge will be lifted, according to the Independent.\n\nDay trippers visiting Venice between 8.30am and 4pm will be required to pay the fee, which equates to \u00a34.28. Visitors can either download a QR code, while a kiosk has been set up for those not equipped with a smartphone.\n\nREAD MORE: Why are there protests in the Canary Islands and what does it mean for Brits?\n\nOn Thursday Signs advising arriving visitors of the new requirement were erected outside the main train station and other points of arrival. Some 200 stewards have been trained to politely walk anyone unaware of the five euro fee through the process of downloading a QR code.\n\nOnce past designated entry ports, officials will carry out random checks for QR codes that show the day-tripper tax has been paid or that the bearer is exempt. Transgressors face fines of 50-300 euros (\u00a353-\u00a3257).\n\n\"We need to find a new balance between the tourists and residents,\" said the city's top tourism official, Simone Venturini. \"We need to safeguard the spaces of the residents, of course, and we need to discourage the arrival of day-trippers on some particular days.\"\n\nVenice has long suffered under the pressure of over-tourism, but officials say that pre-pandemic estimates ranging from 25 million to 30 million visitors a year -- including day-trippers -- are not reliable and that the pilot project also aims to come up with more exact figures to help better manage the phenomenon. By contrast, registered visitors spending the night last year numbered 4.6 million, according to city figures, down 16per cent from pre-pandemic highs.\n\nMr Venturini said the city is strained when the number of day-trippers reaches 30,000 to 40,000. Its narrow alleyways are clogged with people and water taxis packed, making it difficult for residents to go about their business.\n\nNot all residents, however, are persuaded of the efficacy of the new system in dissuading mass tourism, and say more attention needs to be paid to boosting the resident population and services they need. Venice last year passed a telling milestone when the number of tourist beds exceeded for the first time the number of official residents, which is now below 50,000 in the historic centre with its picturesque canals.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,\" said Tommaso Cacciari, an activist who organised a protest on Thursday against the measure. \"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park; you don't pay a ticket to enter a city. This is the last symbolic step of a project of an idea of this municipal administration to kick residents out of Venice,\" he said.\n\nMr Venturini said about 6,000 people had already paid to download the QR code, and officials expect paid day-tripper arrivals on Thursday to reach some 10,000. More than 70,000 others have downloaded a QR code denoting an exemption, including to work in Venice or as a resident of the Veneto region.\n\nPeople staying in hotels in Venice, including in mainland districts like Marghera or Mestre, should also get a QR code attesting to their stay, which includes a hotel tax. The tourist official says interest in Venice's pilot programme has been keen from other places suffering from mass tourism, including other Italian art cities and cities abroad such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.\n\nFor more of today's top stories, click here.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "liv_clarke@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Liv Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiosk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canary Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marghera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marghera"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mestre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29058310.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ITALY_Venice_094239A.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 252, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-14", "textStart": 409, "textEnd": 416}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

"Venice to charge day-trip entry fee from this week in bold move to tackle overtourism", "body": "On Thursday -- a public holiday in Italy -- day visitors will for the first time have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, monitored by inspectors carrying out spot checks at key points in the UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nVenice is one of the world's top tourist destinations, with 3.2 million visitors staying overnight in the historic centre in 2022 -- dwarfing the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nTens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nThe aim of the tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds.\n\nInitially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nBut the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nIn Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities.\n\nThe UN cultural body UNESCO listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\".\n\nBut UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to UNESCO that would not have any impact.\n\n\"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nIt has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\nVenice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in

On Thursday, a public holiday in Italy, day visitors will for the first time have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, monitored by inspectors carrying out spot checks at key points in the UNESCO world heritage site. Venice is one of the world's top tourist destinations, with 3.2 million visitors staying overnight in the historic centre in 2022 dwarfing the resident population of just 50,000. Tens of thousands more pour into the city's narrow streets for the day, often from cruise ships, to see sights including St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. The aim of the tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds. Initially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July. But the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites. In Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago. Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\". \"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month. Venice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities. The UN cultural body UNESCO listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\". But UNESCO threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change. Venice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system. The idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement. During a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to UNESCO that would not have any impact. \"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin. In 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port. It has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors. Venice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rialto Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canary Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Bettin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianfranco Bettin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Italy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venetian Lagoon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2024-04-24/in-world-first-venice-to-trial-day-tickets-1713915111-1449.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Will it help save Venice, a uniquely beautiful city that campaigners have warned for decades is in peril? And - most importantly, perhaps, for anyone looking to book their trip - how do you buy your tickets?\n\nWhy is this being introduced?\n\nAccording to Simone Venturini, the city's councillor for tourism, Venice \"affixed itself\" to mass tourism in the 1960s and since then visitor numbers have surged to the point that during the busiest periods of the year it attracts an average of 40,000 people a day.\n\nThat number has put pressure on the fragile lagoon, while pushing residents away from the main island. Brugnaro said he wanted to make Venice \"livable\" again.\n\nHowever, the final push to enact the measure came after Unesco threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage sites in danger, citing mass tourism and rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nWhile Venice has moved to counter mass tourism in recent years by banning huge cruise ships from chugging through its centre, the city only escaped the potential shame of losing its Unesco status after the access charge was agreed.\n\nHow much is the charge and who has to pay?\n\nThe \"Venice access fee\" costs \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30). It could be worse - when the idea was first suggested it was \u20ac10. Only day trippers have to pay. Residents, commuters, students and children under 14 are exempt, as are tourists who stay overnight. Critics of the scheme say the \u20ac5 is unlikely to deter many people.\n\nHow do I buy a ticket, and on which dates is one required?\n\nThe tickets are bookable online and apply on 29 peak dates between 25 April and 14 July. The dates are listed on the site. You will be provided with a QR code on your phone - guard it as this is the proof that you have paid the fee.\n\nHang on, Venice is a massive place with dozens of islands. Where exactly does it apply?\n\nThe charge applies only to those entering the historic centre of Venice between 8.30am and 4pm on any of the peak dates. That includes the Rialto Bridge, St Mark's Square, La Fenice opera house and many other top-drawer tourist attractions, as well as quieter neighbourhoods such as the island of Giudecca.\n\nWhat if I arrive in Venice without the QR code or I don't have access to a mobile phone?\n\nFear not. When you arrive in Venice, says the council, be it by train, bus, or boat, stewards wearing white bibs featuring the city's logo will guide you through buying the ticket online and downloading the QR code.\n\nThose without a phone can pay at water taxi stations or in tabacchi shops, Venturini says.\n\nThe five key entrance points are Venezia Santa Lucia train station, bus terminals at Piazzale Roma and Tronchetto, and vaporetti (water bus) stops at Zattere and the Riva degli Schiavoni, the waterfront that covers the entrance to St Mark's Square.\n\nHow will the measure be implemented?\n\nBrugnaro has promised the system will be imposed with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nIn effect, the authorities hope the measure will be implemented by means of a fleet of 180 personnel, made up of volunteer stewards, council staff and public officials. Those wearing white bibs are there to inform, while those wearing yellow bibs are there to do random checks and have the power to issue fines for those without a QR code.\n\nVenturini said that if you arrived without one and did not approach someone in a white bib for information, and you were then spot-checked by someone in a yellow bib, you would risk being fined.\n\nAnd how bad are the penalties?\n\nFines range from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300. \"Don't worry, nobody will be arrested for not having paid the fee,\" said a council spokesperson.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

I think it's right that you have to pay to see a place like Venice.\"\n\nJust to his right, Mark Michanowicz chose to acquire his entrance pass electronically from one of three digital screens set up in the ticket station.\n\n\"I think it's the right thing to do. Venetians have suffered long enough from over-tourism. As a tourist you come, you eat, you go. Who's going to clear up all the mess? I'd be willing to pay \u20ac10. If you're going to visit a beautiful city, why not support it?' said Mr Michanowicz, 64, a retired US Army officer who knows Venice well having been stationed at a base in northern Italy.\n\nAs the first trains of the day arrived, officials in white and yellow bibs conducted random checks on tourists to make sure they had a QR code on their phones that proved they had paid the entrance fee.\n\nMost seemed, if not happy, then at least resigned, to stumping up \u20ac5 each for the privilege of entering 'La Serenissima', as Venice was known during its 1,000-year history as an independent republic.\n\n\"We were meant to have come to Venice yesterday and wouldn't have had to pay, so that's a bit of a bummer,\" said Luca Perotti, 22, from London.\n\n\"We could have spent the money on a gelato or something. But I guess in the grand scheme of things, \u20ac5 is not so bad. Although it doesn't seem to have reduced the number of tourists. The place is rammed,\" said Mr Perotti, a kitchen and bathroom designer who was on a day trip from Verona with his girlfriend Kodie Jamieson, 26, a pharmacy dispenser.\n\nThe entrance payment - the first of its kind in the world - applies only to day-trippers.\n\nTourists who spend at least one night in the city are exempt, as are locals, students, commuters and children under the age of 14, although they all need to register online before they arrive.\n\n\"If our stewards find that a tourist has not made the payment, then they will ask them to do it there and then on their mobile phone,\" said Simone Venturini, the city councillor in charge of tourism. \"Or they can go in person to the ticket office outside the station.\"\n\nTourists who are caught without the QR code face fines of up to \u20ac300.\n\nThe aim is to tackle the mass tourism that is slowly crushing the life out of Venice, with the number of residents now below 50,000.\n\n\"We want to have fewer day-trippers. On some days, Venice is overwhelmed by visitors. We are not closing the city. Everyone can enter. It's just that some people now have to pay,\" said Mr Venturini.\n\nThe entrance fee will be levied on 29 of the busiest days between now and mid-July. \"After that we will review it. It could be extended,\" he said.\n\nBut such a modest charge is unlikely to deter the millions of foreign tourists who long to see Venice, given the high prices they already face once they arrive. An espresso at an outdoor caf\u00e9 in St Mark's Square costs \u20ac12 while a dry Martini will set back the well-heeled visitor \u20ac26.\n\n\"We've been wanting to see Venice for a long time. It's not like we are going to turn around and leave, now that we find out we have to pay,\" said Kelly Snow, 45, from New Hampshire, who was visiting with her twin sister, Cara Carr, from Colorado. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime trip so I'm not bothered about having to pay five bucks.\"\n\nA few hundred protesters held a demonstration against the new tourist fee, saying that it will fail to reduce tourist numbers and does not address the structural problems that many Venetians face.\n\nThere were brief clashes between some protesters and riot police armed with batons and shields, although no reported injuries.\n\nA few hundred people then marched along the city's canals, holding banners which read Airbnb Kills Cities and The Entrance Charge Won't Save Venice.\n\n\"We don't want to be Disneyland. We're not an open-air museum. We're totally against this entrance ticket,\" said Ruggero Tallon, from a protest group that also opposes the presence of huge cruise ships in the lagoon.\n\nFederica Toninello, from another protest group, told The Telegraph: \"This is a sad day for Venice. It's a distraction from the real problem facing Venetians, which is the lack of affordable housing. There are 2,000 council homes which are lying empty because the council hasn't done the necessary work. The population of Venice is now down to 49,000. This is the real issue. We need people to live here. Instead there are ever more hotels for tourists. We don't want an entrance fee. We want more affordable homes.\"\n\nVenice council insists the entrance fee is not a money-making exercise and that the revenue will barely be enough to cover the administration of the scheme.\n\nMany Venetians are unhappy with that, saying that if an entrance charge has to be imposed, the proceeds should go towards improving housing, transport and public services.\n\n\"I live on one of the outer islands in the lagoon and the roads are full of potholes,\" said Giuseppe, a bar owner who declined to give his surname. \"And I think the charge will take money out of the pockets of restaurants and cafes. If a family of four spends \u20ac20 on entering Venice, they'll be inclined to spend less on food and drink.\"\n\nJan van der Borg, an economics professor and expert on tourism at Venice's Ca' Foscari University, believes the entrance fee will not succeed in reducing the tourist crush.\n\nAround 30 million tourists visit Venice each year, of whom 21 million are day-trippers, he said.\n\nThe many categories of people who are exempt from the charge will make it difficult to enforce, he said. \"And we are already hearing that people are sharing their QR codes on Twitter to cheat the system and not have to pay. The scheme is highly inefficient and will cost more than the money it will bring in.\"\n\nHe accused Venetian authorities of fast-tracking the payment scheme after Unesco last year threatened to place the city on its \"World Heritage in Danger\" list because of the threat posed by mass tourism.\n\n\"It was a ticking time bomb which the mayor needed to defuse. Not many people will be dissuaded by having to pay five euros. It's less than the price of a beer in a regular bar in Venice. I don't think it's going to have any effect on the numbers.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Will it help save Venice, a uniquely beautiful city that campaigners have warned for decades is in peril? And - most importantly, perhaps, for anyone looking to book their trip - how do you buy your tickets?\n\nAccording to Simone Venturini, the city's councillor for tourism, Venice \"affixed itself\" to mass tourism in the 1960s and since then visitor numbers have surged to the point that during the busiest periods of the year it attracts an average of 40,000 people a day.\n\nThat number has put pressure on the fragile lagoon, while pushing residents away from the main island. Brugnaro said he wanted to make Venice \"livable\" again.\n\nHowever, the final push to enact the measure came after Unesco threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage sites in danger, citing mass tourism and rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nWhile Venice has moved to counter mass tourism in recent years by banning huge cruise ships from chugging through its centre, the city only escaped the potential shame of losing its Unesco status after the access charge was agreed.\n\nThe \"Venice access fee\" costs \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30). It could be worse - when the idea was first suggested it was \u20ac10. Only day trippers have to pay. Residents, commuters, students and children under 14 are exempt, as are tourists who stay overnight. Critics of the scheme say the \u20ac5 is unlikely to deter many people.\n\nThe tickets are bookable online and apply on 29 peak dates between 25 April and 14 July. The dates are listed on the site. You will be provided with a QR code on your phone - guard it as this is the proof that you have paid the fee.\n\nThe charge applies only to those entering the historic centre of Venice between 8.30am and 4pm on any of the peak dates. That includes the Rialto Bridge, St Mark's Square, La Fenice opera house and many other top-drawer tourist attractions, as well as quieter neighbourhoods such as the island of Giudecca.\n\nFear not. When you arrive in Venice, says the council, be it by train, bus, or boat, stewards wearing white bibs featuring the city's logo will guide you through buying the ticket online and downloading the QR code.\n\nThose without a phone can pay at water taxi stations or in tabacchi shops, Venturini says.\n\nThe five key entrance points are Venezia Santa Lucia train station, bus terminals at Piazzale Roma and Tronchetto, and vaporetti (water bus) stops at Zattere and the Riva degli Schiavoni, the waterfront that covers the entrance to St Mark's Square.\n\nBrugnaro has promised the system will be imposed with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nIn effect, the authorities hope the measure will be implemented by means of a fleet of 180 personnel, made up of volunteer stewards, council staff and public officials. Those wearing white bibs are there to inform, while those wearing yellow bibs are there to do random checks and have the power to issue fines for those without a QR code.\n\nVenturini said that if you arrived without one and did not approach someone in a white bib for information, and you were then spot-checked by someone in a yellow bib, you would risk being fined.\n\nFines range from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300. \"Don't worry, nobody will be arrested for not having paid the fee,\" said a council spokesperson.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporetto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaporetto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Roma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rialto Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Fenice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Fenice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourist attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opera house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tronchetto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tronchetto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tronchetto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giudecca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giudecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Giudecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/e2671e4af856f7f29f40d54938600e79", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "dateEnd": "-07-14", "textStart": 2295, "textEnd": 2315}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Venice narrowly escaped being placed on UNESCO's \"World Heritage in Danger\" list last year partly because the U.N. body decided that the city was addressing concerns that its delicate ecosystem risked being overwhelmed by mass tourism.\n\nBesides introducing the entry charge, the city has also banned large cruise ships from sailing into the Venetian lagoon and has announced new limits on the size of tourist groups. \"The phenomenon of mass tourism poses a challenge for all Europe's tourist cities,\" said Simone Venturini, who is responsible for tourism and social cohesion on the city council.\n\n\"But being smaller and more fragile, it is even more impacted by this phenomenon and is therefore taking action earlier than others to try to find solutions,\" he told Reuters. Ticketing this year is in an experimental phase and Venturini said that in future Venice might start charging more at certain times of the year to look to discourage arrivals.

Signs were set up outside the train station and near an entry footbridge warning visitors they had to pay the new 5-euro ($5.35) charge before diving into Venice's narrow alleyways.\n\nApril 25 is a national holiday in Italy and is the first of 29 days this year when people must buy a ticket if they want to access the lagoon city from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. Reservations are meant to be made online but there is also a booth on hand for those who don't have smartphones.\n\n\"This system is very important because we are finding a new balance between the residents of the community and the day trippers,\" said Simone Venturini, the city councillor responsible for tourism and social cohesion. Although there are no turnstiles at the city gateways, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between 50 and 300 euros to anyone who has failed to register.\n\nHowever, Italian tourists arriving on Thursday said imposing another charge on visitors was unfair. \"I consider Venice to be the most beautiful city in the world and so to deprive a person on a low budget of the opportunity to come here for an hour or two to enjoy this city is surely a shame for these tourists,\" said Gabriella Pappada, from Lecce in southern Italy.\n\nThe initiative is one of a series of measures\n\nin place across Italy to manage tourist flows. Some 20 million people visited Venice last year, a city official said, with roughly half of them staying overnight in hotels or holiday lets - an influx which dwarfs the resident population currently put at around 49,000.\n\nPeople with hotel reservations and visitors aged under 14 do not need to pay the entry fee, but still need to register beforehand. Residents, students and workers are exempt. Venice narrowly escaped being placed on UNESCO's \"World Heritage in Danger\" list last year partly because the U.N. body decided the city was addressing concerns that its delicate ecosystem risked being overwhelmed by mass tourism.\n\nBesides introducing the entry charge, the city has also banned large cruise ships from sailing into the Venetian lagoon and has announced new limits on the size of tourist groups.

tickets is to persuade day trippers to come during quieter periods, to try to thin out the worst of the crowds.\n\nInitially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nBut the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost the local economy but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.\n\nIn Spain, the world's second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city's scheme as \"an experiment, and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\nUnesco warning\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world's most beautiful cities.\n\nThe UN cultural body Unesco listed the city and its lagoon as a world heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \"extraordinary architectural masterpiece\".\n\nBut Unesco threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nVenice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to Unesco that would not have any impact.\n\n\"Fifty euros might have done something,\" said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day-trippers emerge daily, rerouting them to a more distant industrial port.\n\nIt has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\nNo queuesVenice's mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nControllers will be stationed in and around the city's main entrances, notably the Santa Lucia train station, performing spot checks on visitors.\n\nTourists without their ticket will be invited to purchase one on arrival, with the help of local operators.\n\nBut they could also risk fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" targets only daily tourists entering the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with tourists staying in hotels, minors under 14, and the disabled among those exempt.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of tickets - downloaded in the form of a QR code from a

Demonstrators armed with signs and banners lined the historic canals and narrow alleyways of the Italian city to show their contempt for the unique new policy aimed at clamping down on overtourism in busy periods.\n\nAmid the furore, it was business as usual for Venice's gondoliers, pictured ferrying a group of tourists through the city as they snapped photos of the burgeoning protests around them. Critics maintain that the \u20ac5 ($5.40) fee, in effect from today until May 5, and on weekends until July 14, is unlikely to put a significant dent in the circa 30 million trips made to Venice each year - and could backfire by tarnishing the city's public image.\n\nIn a surprising statement, former mayor Massimo Cacciari went so far as to suggest tourists should flat-out refuse to pay the 'absurd' entrance fee, arguing they already 'pay for everything'. Cacciari noted in a statement to Adnkronos news agency that day visitors already pay 'three times as much as residents' for public transport in the city, and that travellers all contribute to the longevity of Venice's restaurants and museums.\n\nIn scathing remarks, he added that he would 'love to see' city authorities 'justify in a court the legitimacy of imposing a tax on entering the city'. 'What are they going to do, block people's movement, send out the police to ask to see everyone's papers?\n\nDespite pleas from residents groups to rethink the scheme, Venice today become the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for day-tripper tourists, aimed at reducing the number of short-stay visitors who cause unmanageable congestion in peak times. The so-called 'tourist tax' has been controversial, with several residents' committees and associations planning protests to coincide with the launch today in Italy.\n\nIndeed, large crowds gathered with colourful banners in marches against the move. Reps argue the fee will not fix the fundamental issues but only cloud the city's public image. Under the new rules, a fee will be charged to tourists passing through the city without staying overnight.\n\nAuthorities hope this might help manage the flow of some 30 million tourists drawn in by the city's history and romantic canals each year. The scheme will be implemented only on the 29 busiest days of the calendar year between now and May 5, and on weekends until July 14 within certain time slots. Those who choose to stay in a hotel overnight will be exempted. Residents, commuters, students and children under 14 will also be let off the fee. But from today, day-trippers will have to buy a ticket online that will provide them with a QR code, allowing them to appease stewards carrying out random checks with powers to issue fines ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300 ($320)for being caught without a code.\n\nThe local council said 5,500 people had already booked a ticket for Thursday, bringing in \u20ac27,500 ($29,500) on the first day of the program. They deny it is primarily a money-making initiative, however. Simone Venturini, the councillor in charge of tourism, defended the policy as part of a wider strategy trying to tackle the problems of overtourism, while admitting it was 'no magic wand'. 'We want to discourage day-trippers from visiting Venice during these 29 designated days,' he said. 'Fewer day trippers does not mean less revenue because overnight tourists are more important to the economy of the city.\n\n'We will see the results in the medium to long-term and in the meantime we will assess how it goes.' Venturini said previously the scheme aims to find 'a new balance between the rights of those who live, study or work in Venice and those who visit the city'. Venice's authorities have had a long wait to see the plan come to fruition, with initial proposals brought in 2019 set back by the pandemic. The city also dropped plans to charge day-trippers \u20ac10 a day last year, with Venturini citing 'resistance'.\n\nOnce more, residents are turning out to slam the plan, arguing the move is affecting the city's image as an attractive destination for holidaymakers. 'I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it,' suggested Matteo Secchi, who leads residents' activist group Venessia.com. 'You can't impose an entrance fee to a city; all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice ... I mean, are we joking?' Federica Toninello, head of the ASC association for housing, suggested the council hadn't 'really understood the consequences' of mass tourism in Venice. 'For a start, \u20ac5 will do nothing to deter people. But day trippers aren't the issue; things like the shortage of affordable housing are... What we need are policies to help residents, for example, making rules to limit things like Airbnb,' he said, as reported by The Guardian .\n\nVenice's population has steadily fallen in recent years, in part as residents leave and let out their flats to tourists. In turn, this reduces the supply of available housing and makes homes more expensive for residents. Barcelona has faced a similar problem and, in 2021, set precedent by becoming the first European city to ban short-term private room rentals under 31 days. Rome and Milan, two of Italy's most touristic cities, have also since sought the ability to restrict short-term room lets as rents rise and salaries flatline. Venetians also have concerns that short-term visitors spend less than tourists who rent rooms or book out hotels for several days.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

An estimated 20 million annual visitors bump up the city's GDP, but have also been ravaging its delicate landscape in the process.\n\nNow Venice is fighting back, first by limiting group numbers and now by charging short term visitors a fee to visit in the hopes that some will turn around.\n\nBut the latest move to reduce footfall and bump up the coffers of Venice's public finances appears to be one too far for the city's angry locals.\n\nVenice is facing a long-term crisis, but for years has done little to address the apparent source of much of its issues, soaring visitor numbers.\n\nThe city, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, has experienced a population decline of 70,000 since the 1950s. In 2022, the number of tourist beds hit a milestone by outnumbering residents in the city for the first time.\n\nVenice is also hoping to offset the ecological impacts of such huge visitor numbers. The city was almost put on UNESCO's endangered list last year. In the long run, there are fears that rising water levels could flood significant parts of the city.\n\nIn an attempt to deter soaring visitor numbers, Venice has introduced a number of measures aimed at inconveniencing some travelers.\n\nThe main source of their ire has been day-trippers, who typically don't spend as much as longer-term visitors, who pay for accommodation. They also make up about 80% of the city's visitors.\n\nIn December, the city announced it would be placing a 25-person cap on the size of congregating groups, coming into place on June 1.\n\nThe city said the number was determined to align with the maximum group size in its museums. However, it was also calculated as about half the size of a classic tourist bus, potentially causing havoc for travel agents.\n\nThe latest move by the city will target tourists' wallets.\n\nStarting Thursday, day-trippers to Venice will face a \u20ac5 charge ($5.36) if they enter the city.\n\nThe charge, which was teased in September last year, won't apply to longer-term visitors, and will only be applicable on 29 peak days between Thursday and July 14 as a trial phase.\n\nBut the charge, which mayor Luigi Brugnaro says is intended to make the city \"liveable\" again, has been met with anger by Venice residents.\n\nVenice is bracing for protests Thursday as residents react angrily to the introduction of charges against short-term visitors.\n\nSome locals are merely concerned by the optics of an unusual move to charge people a fee to enter a city.\n\n\"I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it,\" Matteo Secchi, who leads residents' activist group Venessia.com, told the Guardian. \"You can't impose an entrance fee to a city, all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice... I mean, are we joking?\"\n\nBut other negative soundings point to an underlying tension between locals and the Venetian government over what is being done to ensure residents can continue to live there.\n\n\"It needs to be clarified where all this income will go,\" Venice resident Nicola Ussardi told Euronews.\n\n\"They should repair the thousands of abandoned houses in this city.

But officials hope that it might encourage some to rethink their plans and decide to come on weekdays or in the offseason. That might help mitigate the impact of the estimated 20 million visitors who descended last year on the city's beleaguered residents, which number fewer than 50,000, according to municipal statistics. About half of those visitors came only for the day, city officials said. Overnight guests are exempt from the fee.\n\nThe spirit of the initiative, city officials have said, is to make people aware of the uniqueness - and fragility - of Venice. Overtourism is creating an economy solely based on tourism that risks killing the city by pushing its dwindling residents out, said Nicola Camatti, an economics professor and expert in tourism at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.\n\nThe fee goes into effect Thursday, a holiday in Italy. For 2024, city officials have singled out 29 peak days when single-day travelers in Venice between 8.30 am and 4pm have to pay. The days run until mid-July and are mostly on national holidays and weekends. The access fee website provides a list of the dates.\n\nWhile just about everyone visiting the city has to register to obtain a QR code, not all visitors have to pay the fee. Overnight guests at registered accommodations like hotels or Airbnbs are exempt, because they already pay a daily tourist tax, as are people who study or work in Venice and those visiting relatives. There are other exemptions as well.\n\nResidents of Venice, those born there and minors younger than 14 are among those who do not have to register. But they must have documents that prove their status.\n\nIt is possible that different fees will apply next year on a sliding scale that will depend on how many people city officials expect on any one day. City officials said the fees could be as high as 10 euros per day.\n\nBefore coming to Venice on peak days, visitors should use the website to register and get a QR code.\n\nThe code will be scanned at points where visitors enter, like the train station, the city parking lot, the airport and the sprawling waterfront along the San Marco basin where boats dock. The access points will have one line for tourists and another for residents and what officials call city users, who are coming into Venice for reasons other than sightseeing.\n\nAt least for now, those who do not register ahead of time can do so at some access points or on their cellphones, officials said. Assistants will be available.\n\nInitially, the controls will be \"very soft,\" said Michele Zuin, the municipal councilor responsible for the city's budget.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the foreign press association in Rome this month, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the fee was not about cashing in on tourists. \"The costs of the operation are higher that what we're going to make,\" he said.\n\nCity officials hope to relieve some of the stress that tourists put on the city by encouraging them to come on less busy days. They also say that by knowing ahead of time how many visitors to expect, the city can better deploy services.\n\n\"We want to better manage the numbers of tourists and disincentivise mass tourism\" that makes it difficult for residents and visitors to \"live in this city,\" Zuin said this month.\n\nTo track the flow of visitors, the city already monitors them via phone location data and surveillance cameras, a system some critics have likened to Big Brother.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca'_Foscari_University_of_Venice", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ca' Foscari University of Venice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marco_basin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Marco basin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/04/25/btvenice20240425.JPG?VersionId=c4TxtbZxuCFyaYjWgUVzWXJfO5eUL2Ud", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 48, "textEnd": 56}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Initially, tickets will only be required on 29 busy days throughout 2024, mostly weekends from May to July.\n\nThe scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors, who boost their economies but risk overwhelming communities and damaging fragile ecosystems and historical sites.Overtourism: 20 cities that could be the next ones to suffer\n\nIn Spain, the world\u2019s second-most visited country after France, tens of thousands of people protested in the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand limits on visitor numbers to the archipelago.\n\nLuigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, has described the city\u2019s scheme as \u201can experiment, and the first time it\u2019s been done anywhere in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to make Venice more liveable,\u201d he said earlier this month.\n\nVenice, spread over more than 100 small islands and islets in northeastern Italy, is considered one of the world\u2019s most beautiful cities. The UN cultural body Unesco listed the city and its lagoon as a World Heritage site in 1987, citing it as an \u201cextraordinary architectural masterpiece\u201d.\n\nBut Unesco threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage in danger, citing mass tourism and also rising water levels attributed to climate change. Venice only escaped the ignominy after local authorities agreed the new ticketing system.\n\nThe idea had long been debated, but repeatedly postponed over concerns it would seriously dent tourist revenue and compromise freedom of movement.\n\nDuring a debate on the plan last September, opposition councillors cast the measure as a hastily arranged concession to Unesco that would not have any impact.\n\n\u201c\u20ac50 might have done something,\u201d said one, Gianfranco Bettin.\n\nIn 2021, Venice had already imposed a ban on massive cruise ships from which thousands of day trippers emerge daily, re-routing them to a more distant industrial port. It has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\nVenice\u2019s mayor has promised the new system will be imposed with a light touch, with \u201cvery soft controls\u201d and \u201cwithout queues\u201d, rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nControllers will be stationed in and around the city\u2019s main entrances, notably the Santa Lucia railway station, performing spot checks on visitors. Tourists without their ticket will be invited to purchase one on arrival, with the help of local operators. But they could also risk fines ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300.\n\nThe \u201cVenice Access Fee\u201d targets only daily tourists entering the old town between 8.30am and 4pm, with tourists staying in hotels, minors under 14 and the disabled among those exempt.\n\nFor the time being, there is no ceiling on the number of tickets \u2013 downloaded in the form of a QR code from a website \u2013 distributed each day.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rialto Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Italy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venetian Lagoon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canary Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Bettin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianfranco Bettin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(contract)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concession (contract)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-16", "textStart": 750, "textEnd": 760}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Will it help save Venice, a uniquely beautiful city that campaigners have warned for decades is in peril? And - most importantly, perhaps, for anyone looking to book their trip - how do you buy your tickets?\n\nAccording to Simone Venturini, the city's councillor for tourism, Venice \"affixed itself\" to mass tourism in the 1960s and since then visitor numbers have surged to the point that during the busiest periods of the year it attracts an average of 40,000 people a day.\n\nThat number has put pressure on the fragile lagoon, while pushing residents away from the main island. Brugnaro said he wanted to make Venice \"livable\" again.\n\nHowever, the final push to enact the measure came after Unesco threatened last year to put Venice on its list of heritage sites in danger, citing mass tourism and rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nWhile Venice has moved to counter mass tourism in recent years by banning huge cruise ships from chugging through its centre, the city only escaped the potential shame of losing its Unesco status after the access charge was agreed.\n\nThe \"Venice access fee\" costs \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30). It could be worse - when the idea was first suggested it was \u20ac10. Only day trippers have to pay. Residents, commuters, students and children under 14 are exempt, as are tourists who stay overnight. Critics of the scheme say the \u20ac5 is unlikely to deter many people.\n\nThe tickets are bookable online and apply on 29 peak dates between 25 April and 14 July. The dates are listed on the site. You will be provided with a QR code on your phone - guard it as this is the proof that you have paid the fee.\n\nThe charge applies only to those entering the historic centre of Venice between 8.30am and 4pm on any of the peak dates. That includes the Rialto Bridge, St Mark's Square, La Fenice opera house and many other top-drawer tourist attractions, as well as quieter neighbourhoods such as the island of Giudecca.\n\nFear not. When you arrive in Venice, says the council, be it by train, bus, or boat, stewards wearing white bibs featuring the city's logo will guide you through buying the ticket online and downloading the QR code.\n\nThose without a phone can pay at water taxi stations or in tabacchi shops, Venturini says.\n\nThe five key entrance points are Venezia Santa Lucia train station, bus terminals at Piazzale Roma and Tronchetto, and vaporetti (water bus) stops at Zattere and the Riva degli Schiavoni, the waterfront that covers the entrance to St Mark's Square.\n\nBrugnaro has promised the system will be imposed with \"very soft controls\" and \"without queues\", rejecting speculation the city would be installing barriers or turnstiles in the streets.\n\nIn effect, the authorities hope the measure will be implemented by means of a fleet of 180 personnel, made up of volunteer stewards, council staff and public officials. Those wearing white bibs are there to inform, while those wearing yellow bibs are there to do random checks and have the power to issue fines for those without a QR code.\n\nVenturini said that if you arrived without one and did not approach someone in a white bib for information, and you were then spot-checked by someone in a yellow bib, you would risk being fined.\n\nFines range from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300. \"Don't worry, nobody will be arrested for not having paid the fee,\" said a council spokesperson.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

City leaders hope it will make visitors more aware of the city's fragility.\n\nAfter years of debate, Venice on Thursday will begin charging day visitors five euros to visit its fragile historic center on peak days, making it the first city in the world to adopt such a measure to counter overtourism.\n\nCritics question whether a nominal fee will put people off from visiting one of the world's most desired destinations. But officials hope that it might encourage some to rethink their plans and decide to come on weekdays or in the off-season. That might help mitigate the impact of the estimated 20 million visitors who descended last year on the city's beleaguered residents, which number fewer than 50,000, according to municipal statistics. About half of those visitors came only for the day, city officials said. Overnight guests are exempt from the fee.\n\nThe spirit of the initiative, city officials have said, is to make people aware of the uniqueness -- and fragility -- of Venice. Overtourism is creating an economy solely based on tourism that risks killing the city by pushing its dwindling residents out, said Nicola Camatti, an economics professor and expert in tourism at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.\n\nWhen will Venice start charging?\n\nThe fee goes into effect on Thursday, a holiday in Italy. For 2024, city officials have singled out 29 peak days when single-day travelers in Venice between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. have to pay. The days run until mid-July and are mostly on national holidays and weekends. The access-fee website provides a list of the dates.\n\nWho must pay?\n\nWhile just about everyone visiting the city has to register to obtain a QR code, not all visitors have to pay the fee.

Venice is the first city in the world to implement this path, which can be an example for other fragile and delicate cities that must be safeguarded,\" he continued.\n\nSimone Venturini, Venice city councilor for tourism, told ABC News that the smart control center is within the most important part of the city -- Piazza San Marco, or St. Mark's Square.\n\n\"Authorities will use the new QR codes, plus cell phone data and the roughly 700 cameras around Venice to track and potentially regulate visitors,\" he explained. \"We are switching to action after 60 years of only debate... our ultimate goal is to find a new balance between the needs of the residents and the needs of tourists.\"\n\nVenturini told ABC News local officials had \"a lot of discussion\" with leaders in other cities who have worked to combat overtourism, including Amsterdam, Barcelona and Kyoto.\n\n\"We are talking together just to find the solution,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regions of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://weisradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/venice-italy-01-gty-jef-240425_1714045578429_hpMain_16x9_99228129.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

In a historic move, the city has become the first in the world to implement a tourist fee, aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of mass tourism and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.\n\nThe pilot program, which commenced on April 25, coinciding with a national holiday in Italy, imposes a fee of 5 euros ($5.4) on day-trippers visiting Venice. Municipal workers have been stationed outside the Santa Lucia railway station, verifying tickets and ensuring compliance with the new regulation. Signs have been prominently displayed to inform tourists about the payment requirement.\n\nUnder the program, day-trippers entering Venice between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. are subject to the fee, while access is free outside of these hours. Failure to pay the fee may result in fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros. However, overnight visitors staying within the municipality of Venice are exempt from the charge but must possess a QR code to pass through the city's main access points.\n\nDespite the city's efforts to address over-tourism, not all residents and visitors are supportive of the new measure. Protesters clashed with riot police, expressing opposition to the pilot program. Some banners displayed slogans such as \"No to ticket, Yes to houses and services for all,\" reflecting discontent with the initiative.\n\nVenice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro defended the program, emphasizing its significance in improving the city's livability and sustainability. In a social media post, he highlighted Venice's pioneering role in tackling over-tourism and underscored the initiative's aim to ensure safety, cleanliness, and enhanced services for both residents and visitors.\n\nOvertourism has long been a concern for Venice, with locals lamenting its detrimental effects on housing affordability and community life. The disparity between the city's resident population, estimated at 50,000, and the millions of annual visitors underscores the urgency of addressing the issue. Cruise ship tourism, in particular, has drawn criticism for overcrowding and straining the city's infrastructure.\n\nAs Venice charts a new course in tourism management, the introduction of the tourist fee marks a significant step towards fostering a more sustainable and equitable future for one of the world's most iconic destinations.", "source": {"uri": "arabtimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARAB TIMES - KUWAIT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilot experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/venice-residents-protest-entry-fee-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 23, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Photos show police clashing with some protesters.\n\nThe long-awaited contributo di accesso (it's styled as an 'access contribution' rather than a ticket) started at 8.a.m. on Thursday. The city council is running a pilot project until mid July to see if it can make the system work.\n\nAnybody visiting Venice as a tourist for the day - except those who live in the local Veneto region - must pay the 5 euro ($5.40) charge if they arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m..\n\nTourists staying overnight don't have to pay, as an overnight tax is already added to their accommodation bills. However they too will have to register their presence to request an exemption to the fee. Essentially, anyone entering the city on dates the fee is charged must carry either a ticket or an exemption. The only exceptions are residents of Venice and people who were born there.\n\nHundreds of locals participated in a protest at Piazzale Roma, the entry point by road to the city, though the exact number was disputed. Protestors say that at its largest the group was 1,000 strong, while the authorities said that only 300 attended.\n\nA smaller protest took place near the main train station with Venetians confronting the mayor who was giving interviews to various television crews. That protest ended up in an embrace with the mayor, according to news reports which captured the confrontation.\n\nRuggero Tallon, one of the main protest organizers and the spokesperson for anti-cruise ship campaign group No Grandi Navi, told CNN that the group had planned to erect a banner spelling out \"Welcome to Veniceland\" and hand out fake \"tickets\" to passersby, but were stopped by police. Instead they marched to Campo Santa Margherita, one of the city's main squares.\n\n\"We rose up against the mayor's idea of a closed city, a museum city,\" Tallon told CNN.\n\n\"A ticket does nothing. It doesn't stop the monoculture of tourism. It doesn't ease the pressure on Venice. It's a medieval tax and it's against freedom of movement.\"\n\nHe expressed concern that the project is being managed by a private company, which will receive people's data, and suggested that other moves by the authorities - including angling for the return of cruise ships to the lagoon, and not yet restricting Airbnbs - are adding to the problem.\n\n\"With the one hand they are doing this, with the other they are doing everything to increase the number of tourists,\" said Tallon, who called mass tourism a \"global problem.\"\n\n\"The only way [forward] is to repopulate the city - we have 49,000 inhabitants and there are more beds for tourists than residents,\" he said. \"Let's try to make it possible for people to live here. Every house that's lived in is a house taken away from tourism.\"\n\nElena Gastaldello, president of Arci (Italian recreational and cultural association) of Veneto, who took part in the protest, said that the entrance fee will not control numbers.\n\n\"The ticket will not impose limits on tourist access to Venice as no maximum number of visitors has been established, but it will further transform the city into an amusement park,\" she told CNN by phone.\n\n\"This measure is not accompanied by concrete policies for urban development, rent containment and ease of finding housing. It solves no problems.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor's office told CNN that 113,000 visitors registered for the first day, with about 80,000 doing so in advance. Of that number, 15,700 - a little over 10% - paid the fee.\n\nOf the exemptions, almost 40,000 were hotel guests, and around 4,000 were friends or family of residents. Over 20,000 commuters and 13,000 students entered the city. School groups were also counted.\n\nThe council said that they inspected the credentials of nearly 14,000 people.\n\n'It's laughable'\n\nThe registration scheme has spotlit the housing problems for residents - on the first day alone, 5,300 people had registered to enter the city as second home owners. Venetian residents now number less than 50,000, with tens of thousands squeezed out of the city to make room for second homes and Airbnbs.\n\nIn preparation for the first day, the council spent the past few days setting up checkpoints outside the train and bus terminals, with separate lines for \"residents\" and \"tourists.\" There is also a booth outside the train station for arrivals to pay the fee or register an exemption. Around 150 people have been employed to verify people's documents and provide advice.\n\nThe fee will be charged on 29 days between now and July 14. After that, mayor of Venice Luigi Brugnaro has said that they will review how the pilot project has gone before they decide how to continue.\n\n\"Nobody has ever done anything to regulate tourism and we believed it was necessary to do something,\" he said in a statement on the first day of the project.\n\nThe fee has proved controversial with Venetians who fear that it risks turning the city into a theme park, and dislike the idea of having to register any guests.\n\nAs some locals geared up to protest the introduction of the fee, fully booked trains were pouring into the city from Milan and Rome.\n\nThe first tourists to be faced with the checkpoints on entering the city seemed unfazed.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing - it wouldn't deter me,\" said Dominic Gagliano, a regular Italy visitor from from Scottsdale, Arizona, as he got off a train at Santa Lucia station.\n\n\"I went to Cinque Terre last fall and it was just impossible. And we just came from Verona - I was last there in 2015 and it has changed so much. I think if you want to come to Venice, you're going to pay 5 euros to be here.\"\n\nGagliano, who had booked an Airbnb, said that the host had sent the link to apply for an exemption. The process was fairly smooth, he said - other than having to phone an Italian number to get confirmation. \"I don't understand why they didn't just have an email confirmation,\" he said.\n\nCaroline Butler, from Wilmington, North Carolina, was also in favor of the move.\n\n\"I went to Florence for the fifth time recently and I had to get out - the crowds were so thick,\" she said. \"It was like July.\"\n\nCanadians Denise Gomes and Brian Johnson from Ottawa said they had been keeping track of when the fee would be introduced, having heard about it in the news back home. Their hotel hadn't informed them.\n\n\"I'm in favor of it - my assumption is it's going to help pay for infrastructure to allow others to see Venice,\" she said.\n\nFor Johnson, it's important that visitors contribute to the destinations they travel to.\n\n\"People go on a cruise and don't spend a penny, but someone's got to pay,\" he said.\n\n\"We always try to inject money into the local economy,\" said Gomes. \"It's really important.\"\n\nLocals, however, remained skeptical. Paolo Brandolisio, who makes oars and forcole (Venice's famous rowlocks for gondolas) told CNN that he doesn't think the fee will help the city under siege from overtourism.\n\n\"They're not putting an upper limit for entry, and today 80,000 people have booked - it'll be a nightmare,\" he said.\n\n\"What happens if 150,000 people book and they have to let them in? They say that people's freedom must be respected, but that they must pay. It's laughable.\"\n\nHe suggested incentivizing visitors to stay longer, by offering discounts for longer hotels, for example - or simply limiting visitor numbers. Prioritizing life for locals was ultimately more important to preserve Venice, he added.\n\nAchille Giacom, who was staging a one-man protest outside the train station throughout the afternoon, said that he was concerned about handing over data.\n\n\"It's a measure of control on the population,\" he said. \"Data is just another resource. [Mankind] has used up the planet's natural reserves and human reserves, and now it wants our data.\n\n\"Italians are usually the first to disobey, but with this it's like they're hypnotized.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

If someone traveling for the day in Venice is caught without the code, they may face a fine of up to 300 euros.\n\n\"It is not a revolution, but the first step of a path that regulates the access of daily visitors. An experiment that aims to improve the liveability of the city, who lives there and who works there. We will carry it forward with great humility and with the awareness that there may be problems,\" Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in a statement on X regarding the announcement.\n\n\"The margins of error are wide, but we are ready, with humility and courage, to make all the changes that will serve to improve the procedure. Venice is the first city in the world to implement this path, which can be an example for other fragile and delicate cities that must be safeguarded,\" he continued.\n\nSimone Venturini, Venice city councilor for tourism, told ABC News that the smart control center is within the most important part of the city -- Piazza San Marco, or St. Mark's Square.\n\n\"Authorities will use the new QR codes, plus cell phone data and the roughly 700 cameras around Venice to track and potentially regulate visitors,\" he explained. \"We are switching to action after 60 years of only debate... our ultimate goal is to find a new balance between the needs of the residents and the needs of tourists.\"\n\nVenturini told ABC News local officials had \"a lot of discussion\" with leaders in other cities who have worked to combat overtourism, including Amsterdam, Barcelona and Kyoto.\n\n\"We are talking together just to find the solution,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType":

We will see the results in the medium- to long-term and in the meantime we will assess how it goes.\"\n\nDepending on how successful it is in reducing visitor numbers, it could be extended.\n\nThe booking system will also enable Venetian authorities to know how many tourists will arrive in the city on any given day so that they can better plan public transport and rubbish collection, Mr Venturini said.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_squires@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Nick Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Cacciari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massimo Cacciari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(family_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legitimacy (family law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnkronos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adnkronos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rialto Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7sVkHeK4fk2k6URGNO6_YQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/e59275bd6b37ead52ab69500488529e3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

According to The Guardian, the city's mayor Luigi Brugnaro has claimed that this new charge has been brought in to deter overcrowding and make Venice \"livable\" again.\n\nHowever, locals in Venice accused the authorities of making the city a \"theme park\" with this change. Venice has long been dealing with an increase of tourists and day-trippers, with visitors reaching an all-time high in 2023.\n\nMatteo Secchi, leader of residents' activist group Venessia, told the publication: \"I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it. You can't impose an entrance fee to a city; all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice ...

Venice attracts about 20 million visitors annually, many of whom are referred to as \"hit-and-run\" tourists since they don't even stay overnight but rather swing by for a few hours just to see the top attractions.\n\nVenetian authorities have long discussed measures to counteract overtourism, and on Thursday, the municipal government rolled out a new experimental scheme to charge daytrippers a fee to access the city center.\n\nMayor Luigi Brugnaro insists the access fee isn't meant to generate revenue but rather to \"decongest\" the city. At a modest cost of \u20ac5 (a little over $5 depending on exchange rates) per person per day, the measure is intended to curb but not entirely cut out foreign foot traffic. \"The objective is not to close the city, but not let it explode,\" Brugnaro said at a press conference in February.\n\nFor now, the access fee only applies on 29 peak travel days -- mostly weekends -- from April 25 to July 14. The fee is payable online through the city website.\n\nThe access fee is applicable to visitors between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. of Venice's historic center but not its smaller outer islands. Overnight visitors who pay a tourist tax, which was introduced in 2011, included in their accommodation fees are exempt from the access fee, as are residents, commuters, students, and children under 14.\n\nWhile initial talks of an access fee included the potential for turnstiles, the system as implemented will be enforced instead through random checks by security personnel. Payers of the access fee will receive a QR code they can present, while certain exempt categories can present their IDs and others can apply for an exemption QR code. Fines for not paying the access fee will range from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300.\n\nThe fee has been met with some criticism: a former mayor called it \"pure madness, completely illegitimate and unconstitutional.\" But Brugnaro stands by the move. \"We have a duty to preserve these great historic centers of the world,\" he told reporters earlier this month, adding that if the experimental scheme, which he admits can be improved as its outcomes are observed, succeeds, it could become a model for other cities around the world.\n\n\"The phenomenon of mass tourism poses a challenge for all Europe's tourist cities,\" Simone Venturini, a member of the Venetian city council responsible for tourism and economic development, told Reuters. \"But being smaller and more fragile, [Venice] is even more impacted by this phenomenon and is therefore taking action earlier than others to try to find solutions,\" he said, adding that the fee could even be increased at different times of the year to discourage arrivals.\n\nThe access fee is just the latest of a number of recent schemes Venice authorities have implemented to lessen the impacts overtourism has wrought. In 2021, the city banned large cruise ships from entering inner waterways, and earlier this year, it imposed a 25-person cap on tour groups and a ban on loudspeakers in the city's historic center.\n\nVenice and its lagoon was first designated as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) world heritage site in 1987, but the U.N. agency last year considered putting it on its list of world heritage sites in danger, as the city reels from the effects of climate change and mass tourism.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(family_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legitimacy (family law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venetian Lagoon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/venice-overtourism.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "dateEnd": "-07-14", "textStart": 1429, "textEnd": 1448}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The initiative includes spot checks by inspectors at key UNESCO sites to ensure compliance. Read less\n\nStarting this week, Venice will be introducing a pioneering initiative: charging day trippers for entry, a first of its kind globally. This measure is aimed at addressing the challenges posed by mass tourism, which has been inundating the city and straining its infrastructure. By implementing entry fees, Venice hopes to alleviate the pressure and preserve its unique heritage and environment for future generations.\n\n10 visa-free countries famous for their rich heritage FacebookTwitterPintrestMore from Travel News1800-year-old Alexander the Great's portrait unearthed in DenmarkChernobyl Exclusion Zone: A surprising haven for diverse wildlifeBali urges foreign tourists to get dengue fever vaccines amid increasing casesMore News\n\nStarting this Thursday, which is a public holiday in Italy, day visitors to Venice will be required to purchase a five-euro (EUR 5) ticket for entry. This marks the first time such a fee will be implemented, and inspectors will be conducting spot checks at various key points within the UNESCO World Heritage site to ensure compliance. The measure aims to manage the influx of tourists and alleviate the strain on Venice's infrastructure caused by mass tourism.\n\nVenice, celebrated as one of the world's top tourist destinations, welcomed a staggering 3.2 million overnight visitors to its historic center in 2022, a number that far surpasses its resident population of just 50,000. In addition to these overnight guests, tens of thousands more flock to the city for the day, often arriving via cruise ships, to marvel at iconic sights such as St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nHowever, the influx of day trippers has contributed to overcrowding in Venice's narrow streets and popular attractions, causing strain on the city's infrastructure and impacting the quality of life for residents. To address this issue, the introduction of entry tickets aims to encourage day trippers to visit during quieter periods, spreading out tourist activity and alleviating the pressure on Venice's historic center.\n\nFrom May to July, entry tickets will only be required on 29 busy days, especially on the weekends. This phased approach aims to manage tourist influx during peak periods while allowing visitors to enjoy Venice during quieter times. However, the scheme is being closely watched as tourist destinations worldwide grapple with surging numbers of visitors. While tourism brings economic benefits to these areas, it also presents challenges, including overcrowding, environmental degradation, and strain on local resources.\n\nVenice's initiative reflects a broader concern about striking a balance between tourism's economic benefits and its potential negative impacts on communities and natural heritage. By implementing measures like entry tickets, cities like Venice seek to protect their cultural and environmental treasures while ensuring a sustainable tourism industry for future generations.\n\nAlso read: New Schengen visa rules announced; longer validity and easier access to Indian nationals\n\nLast year, UNESCO warned of the possibility of placing Venice on its list of heritage sites in danger due to issues such as mass tourism and rising water levels caused by climate change. The city narrowly avoided this designation after local authorities agreed to implement a new ticketing system. The idea of ticketing had been discussed for some time but was repeatedly postponed due to concerns about its potential impact on tourist revenue and freedom of movement.\n\nHow will it be done?\n\nVenice's mayor has assured that the new ticketing system will be implemented with minimal disruption, emphasizing \"very soft controls\" and ensuring there are no queues. Contrary to speculation, there will be no barriers or turnstiles installed in the streets. Instead, controllers will be stationed at key entrances, such as the Santa Lucia train station, conducting spot checks on visitors. Tourists found without a ticket will be encouraged to purchase one upon arrival with assistance from local operators. However, there's also the possibility of being fined an amount between 50-300 euros.\n\nAlso read: Bali urges foreign tourists to get dengue fever vaccines amid increasing cases\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" applies solely to day tourists visiting the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with exemptions for hotel guests, children under 14, and people with disabilities. Currently, there is no limit on the number of tickets available, which can be obtained as a QR code from the website https://cda.ve.it/en/ and are distributed daily.\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinEmail", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander the Great"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rialto Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schengen Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/width-600,height-400,msid-109541420.cms", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Other great European cities should follow suit | Simon Jenkins", "body": "Venice has had enough. It is sinking beneath the twin assaults of tourism and the sea and believes the answer lies in fending off visitors by charging them to enter. It is not alone. Tourism is under attack. Seville is charging for entry to the central Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. In Paris, the Mona Lisa is so besieged by flashing phones she is about to be banished to a basement. Barcelona graffiti shout, \"Tourists go home, refugees welcome.\" Amsterdam wants no more coach parties, nor does Rome.\n\nThe Venice payment will be complicated. It will apply at specific entry points only to day trippers to the city centre, not hotel guests. It will be a mere five euros and confined to peak times of day over the summer. This will hardly cover the cost of running it. It is a political gesture that is unlikely to stem the tourist flow round the Rialto and St Mark's Square, let alone leave more room for Venetians to enjoy their city undisturbed by mobs.\n\nAs any visitor to Venice knows, large areas of it are empty of Venetians - the main island has lost more than 120,000 residents since the early 1950s. Streets and canals are boarded up. If the Grand Canal is lit up at night it is largely thanks to Airbnb. The tourist district is small and jammed with 40,000 visitors a day. Those who have taken the trouble to reach Venice will not be deterred by five euros.\n\nVenice survived intact largely because its economy collapsed and the city realised its future prosperity depended on its antiquity. As it began to sink in the 1960s, writers such as Jan Morris and James Cameron reflected on their sad delight at being the last generation to see Venice before it disappeared. Now the lagoon has been dammed, but the sea is rising and the iron rods beneath the foundations are rusting and rotting. At vast expense they must be repaired, and it is only tourists who will pay the bills.\n\nIn Britain, tourism is the growth industry that gets very little attention and still less praise. Millions of visitors, overseas and domestic, come to London each year, a number that is steadily rising. But its assets have to be defended constantly from planners and developers set on demolition. In addition, there is little tourist destinations can do to expand their \"offer\". Their appeal is a mostly a wasting asset. However, at least London has more space for all those tourists than poor Venice, which has just a mile or so of central streets to satisfy 30 million visitors a year.\n\nWhat is for sure is that Europe's tourism will last as long as it can guard its heritage. Europe is still a treasure trove of humanity's past, embalmed in historic buildings, cultural quarters and old cities. Its appeal to the outside world has barely begun.\n\nAmericans have been the leading tourists in Europe for over half a century, with at least 43% of them having passports. Such documents are held by only 10% of Chinese people and only 7% of Indians. If the numbers of visitors from even just these two countries increase, as they were doing before the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the tourist sites in Europe would have to find new ways to accommodate them.\n\nThe task now is not so much to promote the wonders of Europe's heritage as to conserve and work out how to manage it. Venice is the first such challenge. Some 49,000 remaining Venetian residents cannot possibly pay for the salvation of their city. Thirty million visitors to Venice can. The entry charge is merely a first step.\n\nHow soon other cities imitate Venice remains to be seen. In 2018, the Italian town of Bagnoregio, in the Lazio region, parts of which are crumbling downhill, imposed a charge on visitors to raise money for its rescue. It worked. One of the only British towns with the confidence to charge for entry is charming Portmeirion in north Wales. Despite being built by a modern architect in the 20th century, it has become Wales's most popular attraction.\n\nIf I were Venice, I would be shameless. Visiting ancient places is a glorious indulgence. Those who enjoy it should pay accordingly.

A 2020 study by the Department of Economics at the Ca'Foscari University of Venice found that the city had 30 million visitors each year -- with more than 20 million believed to be spending no more than a day in the city. The high tourism creates unique challenges for residents, who are reportedly seeing longtime stores and basic amenities replaced with tourist stops such as souvenir shops and restaurants,while the explosion of Airbnbs and other short-term rentals have created a housing shortage. Last year, the number of beds available to tourists reportedly surpassed the number of beds available for full-time residents. The tourism raises concerns among officials about Venice's integrity, given its ancient history and architecture. Last year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization warned in a report that Venice could be considered an endangered cultural site, citing tourism as one of the reasons, though it ultimately backed off from formally adding the city to its endangered list.\n\nLess than 50,000. That's how many residents now live in Venice -- a number that's been in steady decline from at least 175,000 in the 1950s, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nVenice is experimenting with artificial intelligence to inform visitors of the change.

The city council is running a pilot project until mid July to see if it can make the system work.\n\nAnybody visiting Venice as a tourist for the day - except those who live in the local Veneto region - must pay the 5 euro ($5.40) charge if they arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m..\n\nTourists staying overnight don't have to pay, as an overnight tax is already added to their accommodation bills. However they too will have to register their presence to request an exemption to the fee. Essentially, anyone entering the city on dates the fee is charged must carry either a ticket or an exemption. The only exceptions are residents of Venice and people who were born there.\n\nA representative from the tourist board told CNN that 82,000 have registered for entry for the first day - a national holiday in Italy - but on average only one in 10 have paid the fee.\n\nAccording to local Il Gazzettino newspaper, which broke down the figures, only 7,266 people had paid the fee. Everyone else had registered exemptions: over 30,000 hotel guests, 15,000 commuters, 11,000 students and nearly 10,000 Veneto residents.\n\nProblems and protests\n\nPreviously, more than 100,000 people poured into Venice on some holidays, leading to scenes like this in 2017. Stefano Mazzola/Awakening/Getty Images\n\nThe registration scheme has spotlit the housing problems for residents - on the first day alone, 5,300 people had registered to enter the city as second home owners. Venetian residents now number less than 50,000, with tens of thousands squeezed out of the city to make room for second homes and Airbnbs.\n\nThe rest of the numbers are made up of school trips and guests of residents.\n\nIn preparation for the first day, the council has spent the past few days setting up checkpoints outside the train and bus terminals, with separate lines for residents, exemptions and those paying the fee. There is also a booth outside the train station for arrivals to pay the fee or register an exemption.\n\nThe fee will be charged on 29 days between now and July 14. After that, mayor of Venice Luigi Brugnaro has said that they will review how the pilot project has gone before they decide how to continue.\n\nThe fee has proved controversial with Venetians who fear that it risks turning the city into a theme park, and dislike the idea of having to register any guests.\n\nThe tourist board spokesperson added that a further 80,000 people have registered to enter the city on Friday, and more on Saturday. Generally on national holidays, over 100,000 day-trippers can pour into the beleaguered city - trebling the regular occupancy.\n\nAs some locals geared up to protest the introduction of the fee, fully booked trains were pouring into the city from Milan and Rome.\n\nBarbie Latza Nadeau in Rome contributed to this story", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_buckley@cnn.com", "name": "Julia Buckley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Day trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_the_Evangelist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark the Evangelist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_of_saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calendar of saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patron saint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Gazzettino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Il Gazzettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2149508545.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 5, "textEnd": 13, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-14", "textStart": 2588, "textEnd": 2595}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The scheme, which will run for 30 days initially as a trial, is designed to reduce over tourism in the city, which some fear is literally and figuratively being eroded away.\n\nThose running Venice have long argued that measures must be taken to protect the city and its way of life from the millions of people desperate to bask in its beauty each year. Luigi Brugnaro, Venice's mayor, said the tax would make Venice \"liveable\" again.\n\nHowever, the introduction of the tax has not been met positively from all quarters. A number of protests are planned for today (Thursday) by those who question the means of controlling the crowds.\n\nMatteo Secchi, who leads residents activist group Venessia.com, told The Guardian: \"I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it. You can't impose an entrance fee to a city; all they're doing is transforming it into a theme park. This is a bad image for Venice ... I mean, are we joking?\"\n\nThe scheme has long been proposed\n\nOver recent decades the city has changed drastically. The strength of cheap, mass budget airlines saw 25 million tourists visit in 2019, with that number projected to reach 38 million by 2025. In less than a century the local population has dropped from 150,000 to 50,000 as old families struggling to pay their bills move to the mainland and let their properties to visitors.\n\nAfter the trial period, the fee is likely to apply on various days across the high season. It is not expected to turn a profit, but simply to cover the cost of the booking system. The tax is required only for access to Venice's historic centre and can be booked online.\n\nThe trial will run until July 14 and apply only on 29 peak days, most of which are weekends. Residents, commuters, students and children under the age of 14 are exempt. Tourists who stay overnight - who have to pay a different tax to sleep in the city - are exempt.\n\nDay trippers must book the ticket online to receive a QR code, which may be scanned by officials making random spot-checks at five main arrival points including Santa Lucia train station. Those without a ticket risk fines of up to \u20ac300. On April 25 - a national holiday in Italy - 5,500 visitors booked a ticket, bringing in \u20ac27,500, the council has said.\n\nFederica Toninello, who leads an association for housing, said that the tax was not enough to deter people and that it is not addressing the real issue anyway. \"But day trippers aren't the issue; things like the shortage of affordable housing are ... What we need are policies to help residents, for example, making rules to limit things like Airbnb,\" he told the Guardian.\n\nEmanuele Dal Carlo, who was lucky enough to be born in Venice, recently told the Mirror how seeing what had happened to his birth city and how much of an issue housing was had inspired him to launch an ethical holiday let company.\n\nWhile Venice may be breaking new ground with the cost and type of its new entrance fee, many other countries and cities around the world already have tourist taxes in place.\n\nCheck out more of Daily Mirror's latest travel stories by signing up to our free weekly newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "milo_boyd@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Milo Boyd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adriatic Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32667252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/77352661_20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-14", "textStart": 1912, "textEnd": 1919}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2396, "textEnd": 2404}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It applies only to visitors to the old city who aren't staying overnight, and costs \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30) a day -- a separate tourist tax is already applicable to overnight stays in the city.\n\nDuring the trial period into summer 2024, the tax is only levied on the following days, and only between the hours of 8.30am and 4pm.\n\n* April 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n* May 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 18, 19, 25, 26\n\n* June 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, 30\n\n* July 6, 7, 13, 14\n\nIf your visit is on any other date, or if you're visiting between the hours of 4pm and 8.30am, you won't have to pay the fee. There are other exemptions too (see below).\n\nIn addition, visits to other islands in the Venice lagoon, such as Murano and Burano, are exempt from the fee during the trial period. It is expected that an access fee will be required in future, but will come under the umbrella of the Venice Access Fee.\n\nVisitors are encouraged to register their visit and pay the fee in advance on the official Venice Access Fee website (cda.ve.it). The process is quite straightforward. You just pick the date of your visit, then enter the number of people in your party and their names. Payment can be made using a credit or debit card, or PayPal, and your QR code to enter the city will be sent to you by email.\n\nChildren under 14 are exempt from the fee but will still need to register for a QR code.\n\nThere are several alternatives to the official website if you cannot use it for whatever reason, including paying the tax at tobacconists that are affiliated with the Italian Tobacconists Federation (PuntoLis). There are also payment points at Piazzale Roma and the Venice Santa Lucia Station square, but the city says these are for exceptional circumstances only.\n\nAttendants at the entrance points to the old city will be performing spot checks on visitors. Fines for those who fail to show a QR code or exemption voucher range from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300, plus a \u20ac10 Access Fee.\n\n* Best hotels in Venice\n\nWhile you don't have to pay the Access Fee if you are staying overnight in Venice, you do have to pay an accommodation tax, which was introduced back in 2011. This fee applies to accommodation ranging from hotels and B&Bs to guesthouses and Airbnb apartments.\n\nThe fee ranges from \u20ac1 to \u20ac5 per person per night, and is determined by factors including the time of year and the type and location of the accommodation.\n\nChildren under the age of ten and disabled visitors are exempt. For those between ten and 16, the tax is 50 per cent of the full price.\n\nThe new Access Fee isn't applicable to everyone entering the old city. Exemptions include:\n\n* tourists staying overnight in the Municipality of Venice\n\n* temporary and permanent residents, and friends and relatives visiting them\n\n* Veneto residents\n\n* people with certified disabilities and accompanying persons\n\n* those requiring medical care or who are visiting someone in a hospital or healthcare facility\n\n* athletes attending certain sporting events\n\n* people attending legal proceedings.\n\nNote that even if you are exempt from paying the fee, you're still required to apply for an exemption voucher before visiting Venice. This can be obtained from the official website.\n\nVenice has long suffered from overtourism, with the amount of foot traffic causing damage to the city's fragile buildings and making it an impractical place for residents to live. On some days, the number of visitors can be many times that of the number of residents.\n\nThe accommodation tax introduced in 2011 was a step towards rectifying the issue, with the money used for repairs and restoration. And in 2017, the city banned cruise ships of a certain size from docking at the St Mark's Square basin.\n\nA special day-tripper tax was written into law at the end of 2018, which gave the city the power to charge up to \u20ac10 a day for visitors who aren't staying overnight. However, due to delays and later Covid, it was postponed for several years before finally being introduced on a trial basis in 2024. The Venice Access Fee is expected to come into full effect in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "thetimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sunday Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qin_xie@thetimes.co.uk", "name": "Qin Xie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venetian Lagoon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burano", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murano", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Murano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Roma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PayPal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Permanent residency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F591f50f9-b79a-405d-a969-4fbb747cc7f9.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 190}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 546, "textEnd": 551}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 591, "textEnd": 597}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-06", "textStart": 628, "textEnd": 634}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The city has just introduced a \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30) fee to enter.\n\nThe entry charge was first suggested in 2019, but ended up getting sidelined by the pandemic and later, by procedural hiccups. This morning, however, Sylvain Pellarin became the first person in the world to pay to enter the World Heritage city.\n\nThe aim of the fee, which applies to day-trippers aged 14 and over, is to establish \"a new balance between the rights of those who live, study or work in Venice and those who visit the city,\" according to Simone Venturini, Venice's tourism councillor.\n\n\"No one has ever done this before,\" Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, told reporters ahead of the experimental measures being introduced. \"We are not closing the city... we are just trying to make it liveable.\"\n\nAny visitor who is not staying the night must pay online before entering the city on April 25, which is an Italian national holiday and the first of 29 days this year when visitors are being charged to get in.\n\nAlthough there are no turnstiles at the city gateways, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between \u20ac50 and \u20ac300 (between \u00a343 and \u00a3257) to anyone who has failed to register.\n\nLast year, Venice tourism authorities said the fee will not actually turn a profit, but will only cover the cost of administering the scheme. So the funds raised won't be put towards cleaning up the canals, for example, or restoring the parts of the city degraded by intense footfall. These issues have been raised by Unesco, when it recommended putting Venice on the heritage danger list.\n\nThe response to the Venice entry fee has been lukewarm, and somewhat sceptical, among industry insiders. \"A \u20ac5 fee is not big enough to reduce tourism numbers significantly,\" said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, which lobbies for positive tourist practices. \"I'd like to see them be bolder and ensure they do make a profit that can be reinvested in the city for the benefit of residents and visitors.\"\n\nPaul Charles of the PC Agency agreed. \"Any fee has to be meaningful and make an impact on tourism volumes. Both Bhutan and Rwanda are good examples of countries which have successfully introduced appropriate fees, to not only manage numbers, but also to give back to the local communities through essential health and education projects. \u20ac5 is not going to make a difference to anyone.\"\n\nMany destinations already charge a tourist tax, typically in the form of a nominal fee added onto a hotel room rate. You will find these in Barcelona, Rome, across Greece, and in dozens of other tourist destinations around the world. Even Manchester introduced a \u00a31 per night tax last year, and Scotland has mooted the idea too. Not many go a step further in charging people for the pleasure of simply entering the destination, although some do.\n\nBhutan charges tourists a daily \"sustainable development fee\", which used to be US$250 (\u00a3200) in the high season but was recently reduced to US$100 (\u00a380) or US$50 (\u00a340) for children aged six to 12. That's in addition to the one-off visa application fee of US$40 (\u00a332). In February, Bali rolled out a one-off US$10 (\u00a38) entry fee, with takings to be pumped back into projects to benefit locals. Another unlikely destination to charge visitors for entry is Clovelly in Devon. The picturesque fishing village, once owned by William the Conqueror, charges \u00a39.50 for adults or \u00a35.50 for children aged seven to 16.\n\nHere are five places that could start charging next:\n\nLogistically, it would be very easy to introduce an entry fee to the walled city of Dubrovnik, given that it only has three entry points (the main one being Pile gate). The city has suffered under the weight of its own popularity in recent years; its population of just over 41,000 was dwarfed by the 1.5 million tourists who arrived in 2019.\n\nTo tackle the issue of overtourism, in 2018 the mayor introduced new plans to cap the number of cruises that could dock in the city to just two. He also reduced the number of souvenir stands in the city by 80 per cent. So, could an entry fee be on the horizon?\n\nSandra Milov&ccaron;evi&cacute;, head of communications at Dubrovnik City Tourism, told the Telegraph: \"The city of Dubrovnik believes that the entry fee model is not a good solution for Dubrovnik, but rather a proper destination management that has so far produced significant results in practice and had a positive response.\"\n\nThe rugged Hebridean Isle of Skye has boomed in popularity in recent years, and has invested heavily in parking, restoring roads and easing congestion at the most popular spots such as the Fairy Pools after media reports that the island was \"full\".\n\nSkye has actually had an entry fee of sorts in recent memory. Just 20 years ago, visitors had to pay \u00a311.40 for a round trip across the bridge connecting the island to the mainland. After significant protests, however, the toll was scrapped at the end of 2004.\n\nCould such a thing ever return? Simon Cousins of the tourist organisation, Skye Connect, said it is managing tourism through other means: \"On Skye we are currently utilising technology to manage the visitor experience and reduce congestion in key areas.\"\n\nGiven that Venice has introduced an entry fee, logic follows that Italy might introduce a similar measure at some of its other tourist hot spots, like Capri.\n\nThe mayor has made noises to suggest it could be considered one day. \"We cannot stop tourists from landing here, but we have to regulate the flow of tourism and we will do some tests like in Venice,\" the mayor of the island, Gianni De Martino, said in 2018.\n\nSo is an entry fee on the horizon? A spokesperson for the Italian tourist board told the Telegraph that no decision has been taken on Capri, and indeed there are no plans in the pipeline. But they said that the success of the Venice scheme will influence whether other parts of Italy suffering from overtourism could take similar action.\n\nThe popular lakeside village of Hallstatt in Austria, which is said to have inspired Disney's Frozen films, is among the most likely destinations to follow Venice's lead by imposing a ticketing system.\n\nThe suggestion came after locals staged protests last summer due to overcrowding in the village; on some days in high season, the population of 700 was outnumbered by up to 10,000 visitors.\n\n\"We have really tried a lot in terms of visitor management. But we have reached a point where we're at the end of our possibilities,\" said Mayor Alexander Scheutz.\n\nThere are no set details on when such a system will come into force, or how much a ticket will cost, but it appears likely to go ahead after Austria's tourism minister, Susanne Kraus-Winkler, spoke in favour of a tourist cap in the hot spot.\n\nBritish stag groups have been told to \"stay away\", the city council has voted to ban cruise ships from docking there, and since 2019 the Netherlands tourist board has stopped actively promoting Amsterdam. Instead, it is trying to disperse visitors to lesser-visited corners such as the province of Zeeland or cities like Groningen.\n\nBased on previous form (there is already a tourist tax of seven per cent of the accommodation rate, plus \u20ac3 per person per night), it isn't unthinkable that Amsterdam might introduce an entry fee for day-trippers in the future. However, how such a thing would be managed is another question.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Photos show police clashing with some protesters.\n\nThe long-awaited contributo di accesso (it's styled as an 'access contribution' rather than a ticket) started at 8.a.m. on Thursday. The city council is running a pilot project until mid July to see if it can make the system work.\n\nAnybody visiting Venice as a tourist for the day - except those who live in the local Veneto region - must pay the 5 euro ($5.40) charge if they arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m..\n\nTourists staying overnight don't have to pay, as an overnight tax is already added to their accommodation bills. However they too will have to register their presence to request an exemption to the fee. Essentially, anyone entering the city on dates the fee is charged must carry either a ticket or an exemption. The only exceptions are residents of Venice and people who were born there.\n\nAround 300 people participated in a protest on Piazzale Roma, which is the closest parking lot before entering the canal city. The Venice city hall spokesperson said it was without incident despite some younger protesters trying to push through a barrier. It dissolved after a few minutes.\n\nA smaller protest took place near the main train station with Venetians confronting the mayor who was giving interviews to various television crews. That protest ended up in an embrace with the mayor, according to news reports which captured the confrontation.\n\nElena Gastaldello, president of Arci (Italian recreational and cultural association) of Veneto, who took part in the protest, said that the entrance fee will not control numbers.\n\n\"The ticket will not impose limits on tourist access to Venice as no maximum number of visitors has been established, but it will further transform the city into an amusement park,\" she told CNN by phone.\n\n\"This measure is not accompanied by concrete policies for urban development, rent containment and ease of finding housing. It solves no problems.\"\n\nHotels and restaurants are largely in favor of the entrance tax since it might convince people to spend the night instead of just coming for the day. Because the daily gates open to the public without a reservation at 4 p.m., most restaurants will not be impacted by the restriction.\n\nA representative from the tourist board told CNN that 100,000 have registered for entry for the first day - a national holiday in Italy - of whom 8,000 paid the fee.\n\n'It's laughable'\n\nThe registration scheme has spotlit the housing problems for residents - on the first day alone, 5,300 people had registered to enter the city as second home owners. Venetian residents now number less than 50,000, with tens of thousands squeezed out of the city to make room for second homes and Airbnbs.\n\nThe rest of the numbers are made up of school trips and guests of residents.\n\nIn preparation for the first day, the council has spent the past few days setting up checkpoints outside the train and bus terminals, with separate lines for residents, exemptions and those paying the fee. There is also a booth outside the train station for arrivals to pay the fee or register an exemption.\n\nThe fee will be charged on 29 days between now and July 14. After that, mayor of Venice Luigi Brugnaro has said that they will review how the pilot project has gone before they decide how to continue.\n\nThe fee has proved controversial with Venetians who fear that it risks turning the city into a theme park, and dislike the idea of having to register any guests.\n\nThe tourist board spokesperson added that a further 80,000 people have registered to enter the city on Friday, and more on Saturday. Generally on national holidays, over 100,000 day-trippers can pour into the beleaguered city - trebling the regular occupancy.\n\nAs some locals geared up to protest the introduction of the fee, fully booked trains were pouring into the city from Milan and Rome.\n\nPaolo Brandolisio, who makes oars and forcole (Venice's famous rowlocks for gondolas) told CNN that he doesn't think the fee will help the city under siege from overtourism.\n\n\"They're not putting an upper limit for entry, and today 80,000 people have booked - it'll be a nightmare,\" he said.\n\n\"What happens if 150,000 people book and they have to let them in? They say that people's freedom must be respected, but that they must pay. It's laughable.\"\n\nHe suggested incentivizing visitors to stay longer, by offering discounts for longer hotels, for example - or simply limiting visitor numbers.\n\nBarbie Latza Nadeau in Rome

The initiative marks the first time such a measure has been enacted in Venice.\n\nThe goal is to mitigate the impact of tourism on the city's delicate ecosystem and historic fabric.\n\nVenice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro says the implementation of the new system will be seamless, featuring \"very soft controls\" to ensure a visitor-friendly approach without the need for physical barriers or long queues.\n\nThe mayor said the city's scheme is \"an experiment and the first time it's been done anywhere in the world. Our aim is to make Venice more liveable,\" he told reporters earlier this month, France 24 reported.\n\nOnce in plan, spot checks will be conducted at critical entry points, including the Santa Lucia train station, to enforce the new policy. Tourists found without a ticket will have the opportunity to buy one upon arrival, facilitated by local operators, though failure to comply could result in fines ranging between \u20ac50 and \u20ac300.\n\nThe \"Venice Access Fee\" specifically targets day tourists visiting the old town from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Exemptions have been made for hotel guests, children under 14 years, and individuals with disabilities. The fee system aims to encourage visitors to plan their trips during less congested times, thereby distributing the tourist load more evenly throughout the year.\n\nThe measure will initially be mandatory on 29 select days during the peak months of May to July, with a focus on weekends when visitor numbers surge. The city's administration and global observers alike will closely monitor the effectiveness of the fee system as destinations worldwide face challenges in balancing tourism with sustainability.\n\nThe new policy follows previous initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of tourism, including the redirection of large cruise ships to an industrial port in 2021 and the imposition of a tax for overnight stays.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Brugnaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luigi Brugnaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_24", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France 24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2023/12/30/Italy_Venice_Mass_Tourism_15528_c0-470-5616-3744_s1770x1032.jpg?ab78b1bc4db36a8bfde7104c165b29c5c49f3109", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nVenice has become the first city in the world to charge admission for daytrippers. It is now a city of culture, cuisine and charges.\n\nStarting on Thursday 25 April 2024, visitors to the historic heart of Venice have had to pay \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30) to access the city between 8.30am and 4pm on key days in spring and summer. It is effectively a congestion charge for tourists.\n\nA leading city transport and tourism official, Arianna Fracasso, told The Independent the scheme is aiming \"to safeguard the city from overtourism\".\n\nAround 30 million tourists visit Venice in a typical year - with about seven out of 10 (or 21 million) staying only for the day. Just before the Covid pandemic, Unesco warned the city's \"status as a World Heritage property is in jeopardy\".\n\nWhile tourists who stay overnight in Venice hotels are exempt from the fee, they must still register online and obtain a code that allows them to pass checkpoints and spot-checks by officials.\n\nMs Fracasso said: \"It's like a museum in the open air, so we want to safeguard it.\"\n\nDuring 2024, charges apply on 29 days. The first is Italy's Liberation Day, commemorating the struggle of the Italian resistance movement against fascism during the Second World War.\n\nThe charge applies for the following 10 days, up to and including Sunday 5 May.\n\nVisits on the seven subsequent weekends, up to and including Sunday 14 July, will also be subject to the fee. But from mid-July onwards, the charge will be lifted.\n\n\"It's an experimental thing just for this year,\" Ms Fracasso said. \"Next year, maybe it will be changed.\"\n\nUnesco warns that \"Venice's 'Outstanding Universal Value', the hallmark of every World Heritage property\" is in peril.\n\nCruise ships were banned from docking in the historic centre of Venice in 2021 in response to a request from the UN body that seeks to protect cultural heritage.\n\nBut Unesco remains concerned about \"overtourism, the potential negative effects of new developments [and] the lack of an integrated management system\".\n\nAny visitor who wishes to be in the historic heart of Venice - anywhere in the city apart from the Piazzale Roma transport access area and the offshore islands - between 8.30am and 4pm on the prescribed dates must register online, in advance, at cda.ve.it/en.\n\nYou will need a QR code on your smartphone or printed out to be allowed inside the ancient city.\n\nIf you simply want to pay the fee, clicking on \"Pay the access fee\" will take you through a fairly straightforward process. One tricky aspect is that you have to pretend you have read the privacy policy (all in Italian) by clicking on it, before you can enable a checkbox.\n\nYes. The hope is that most tourists will apply online. But visitors who arrive at the main access point, Santa Lucia station, can pay with cash at a kiosk. Those who are caught without a permit risk a fine of up to \u20ac500 (\u00a3430).\n\nNo actual barriers are installed, but outside Santa Lucia station there are separate channels for locals and workers, tourists and people leaving the city.\n\nNote that guests in Venice hotels must pay an accommodation tax, usually included in the final bill.\n\nThe pilot scheme as currently designed is not intended to make money, but to cover costs and to discern whether or not there is a deterrent effect on tourism.\n\nThe maximum fee allowed under the law is \u20ac10 (\u00a38.60).\n\nThe unique geography of Venice, comprising an archipelago accessible only by bridge or water, makes it one of the few cities where levying a charge is feasible.

Just before the Covid pandemic, Unesco warned the city's \"status as a World Heritage property is in jeopardy\".\n\nA leading city transport and tourism official, Arianna Fracasso, told The Independent the scheme is aiming \"to safeguard the city from overtourism\".\n\nMs Fracasso said: \"It's like a museum in the open air, so we want to safeguard it.\"\n\nHowever, Venice isn't the only place in Italy that has recently introduced new measures aimed at slowing tourist flows.\n\nHere are some of the initiatives currently in force across Italy:\n\nThe lagoon city has introduced tickets for day trippers that cost 5 euros and are valid from 0830 to 1600 local time. The experiment came into force on April 25, a national holiday in Italy. Tickets will be needed for the following 10 days and thereafter for most weekends until mid-July.\n\nVenice residents, students, workers and home owners are exempt from paying or booking a slot. Visitors aged under 14 and tourists with hotel reservations will need to be registered, but access for them will be free of charge.\n\nOther cities, such as Como, have said they are considering introducing a similar measure, but are waiting to see how the Venice initiative works before deciding.\n\nBesides this, Venice has also said that from June it will limit the size of tourist groups to 25 people and ban the use of loudspeakers by tour guides.\n\nFlorence announced in October it was banning new short-term residential lets on platforms such as Airbnb in its historic centre. It also offered three years of tax breaks to landlords of short-term holiday lets if they start offering ordinary leases for residents.\n\nThe city's famous museum, the Uffizi, offers discounts to people who arrive before 8.55 a.m. and lower prices off-season. To spread out crowds, it also closes at 10 p.m. once a week.\n\nThe five villages that make up the Cinque Terre on the Italian Rivieria regularly get swamped with visitors.\n\nTo try to reduce the overcrowding at peak periods, the authority which oversees the area said this week it would charge visitors 15 euros to walk the most celebrated coastal path. In addition, the path can only be walked in one direction.\n\nThe picturesque small island that lies across the bay from the southern city of Naples has doubled its entry fee, which is automatically added to ferry tickets, to 5 euros. The fee will be charged from April 1 to October 1.\n\nThese islands have introduced limits, or outright bans, on cars for non-residents during the main tourist season.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Como"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Como"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinque_Terre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinque Terre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffizi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uffizi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/07/12/cinq-terre.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "dateEnd": "-10-01", "textStart": 2499, "textEnd": 2519}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 816, "textEnd": 824}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The city has just introduced a \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30) fee to enter.\n\nThe entry charge was first suggested in 2019, but ended up getting sidelined by the pandemic and later, by procedural hiccups. This morning, however, Sylvain Pellarin became the first person in the world to pay to enter the World Heritage city.\n\nThe aim of the fee, which applies to day-trippers aged 14 and over, is to establish \"a new balance between the rights of those who live, study or work in Venice and those who visit the city,\" according to Simone Venturini, Venice's tourism councillor.\n\n\"No one has ever done this before,\" Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, told reporters ahead of the experimental measures being introduced. \"We are not closing the city... we are just trying to make it liveable.\"\n\nAny visitor who is not staying the night must pay online before entering the city on April 25, which is an Italian national holiday and the first of 29 days this year when visitors are being charged to get in.\n\nAlthough there are no turnstiles at the city gateways, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between \u20ac50 and \u20ac300 (between \u00a343 and \u00a3257) to anyone who has failed to register.\n\nLast year, Venice tourism authorities said the fee will not actually turn a profit, but will only cover the cost of administering the scheme. So the funds raised won't be put towards cleaning up the canals, for example, or restoring the parts of the city degraded by intense footfall. These issues have been raised by Unesco, when it recommended putting Venice on the heritage danger list.\n\nThe response to the Venice entry fee has been lukewarm, and somewhat sceptical, among industry insiders. \"A \u20ac5 fee is not big enough to reduce tourism numbers significantly,\" said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, which lobbies for positive tourist practices. \"I'd like to see them be bolder and ensure they do make a profit that can be reinvested in the city for the benefit of residents and visitors.\"\n\nPaul Charles of the PC Agency agreed. \"Any fee has to be meaningful and make an impact on tourism volumes. Both Bhutan and Rwanda are good examples of countries which have successfully introduced appropriate fees, to not only manage numbers, but also to give back to the local communities through essential health and education projects. \u20ac5 is not going to make a difference to anyone.\"\n\nMany destinations already charge a tourist tax, typically in the form of a nominal fee added onto a hotel room rate. You will find these in Barcelona, Rome, across Greece, and in dozens of other tourist destinations around the world. Even Manchester introduced a \u00a31 per night tax last year, and Scotland has mooted the idea too. Not many go a step further in charging people for the pleasure of simply entering the destination, although some do.\n\nBhutan charges tourists a daily \"sustainable development fee\", which used to be US$250 (\u00a3200) in the high season but was recently reduced to US$100 (\u00a380) or US$50 (\u00a340) for children aged six to 12. That's in addition to the one-off visa application fee of US$40 (\u00a332). In February, Bali rolled out a one-off US$10 (\u00a38) entry fee, with takings to be pumped back into projects to benefit locals. Another unlikely destination to charge visitors for entry is Clovelly in Devon. The picturesque fishing village, once owned by William the Conqueror, charges \u00a39.50 for adults or \u00a35.50 for children aged seven to 16.\n\nHere are five places that could start charging next:\n\nDubrovnik, Croatia\n\nLogistically, it would be very easy to introduce an entry fee to the walled city of Dubrovnik, given that it only has three entry points (the main one being Pile gate). The city has suffered under the weight of its own popularity in recent years; its population of just over 41,000 was dwarfed by the 1.5 million tourists who arrived in 2019.\n\nTo tackle the issue of overtourism, in 2018 the mayor introduced new plans to cap the number of cruises that could dock in the city to just two. He also reduced the number of souvenir stands in the city by 80 per cent. So, could an entry fee be on the horizon?\n\nSandra Milov&ccaron;evi&cacute;, head of communications at Dubrovnik City Tourism, told the Telegraph: \"The city of Dubrovnik believes that the entry fee model is not a good solution for Dubrovnik, but rather a proper destination management that has so far produced significant results in practice and had a positive response.\"\n\nThe Isle of Skye, Scotland\n\nThe rugged Hebridean Isle of Skye has boomed in popularity in recent years, and has invested heavily in parking, restoring roads and easing congestion at the most popular spots such as the Fairy Pools after media reports that the island was \"full\".\n\nSkye has actually had an entry fee of sorts in recent memory. Just 20 years ago, visitors had to pay \u00a311.40 for a round trip across the bridge connecting the island to the mainland. After significant protests, however, the toll was scrapped at the end of 2004.\n\nCould such a thing ever return? Simon Cousins of the tourist organisation, Skye Connect, said it is managing tourism through other means: \"On Skye we are currently utilising technology to manage the visitor experience and reduce congestion in key areas.\"\n\nThe Isle of Capri, Italy\n\nGiven that Venice has introduced an entry fee, logic follows that Italy might introduce a similar measure at some of its other tourist hot spots, like Capri.\n\nThe mayor has made noises to suggest it could be considered one day. \"We cannot stop tourists from landing here, but we have to regulate the flow of tourism and we will do some tests like in Venice,\" the mayor of the island, Gianni De Martino, said in 2018.\n\nSo is an entry fee on the horizon? A spokesperson for the Italian tourist board told the Telegraph that no decision has been taken on Capri, and indeed there are no plans in the pipeline. But they said that the success of the Venice scheme will influence whether other parts of Italy suffering from overtourism could take similar action.\n\nHallstatt, Austria\n\nThe popular lakeside village of Hallstatt in Austria, which is said to have inspired Disney's Frozen films, is among the most likely destinations to follow Venice's lead by imposing a ticketing system.\n\nThe suggestion came after locals staged protests last summer due to overcrowding in the village; on some days in high season, the population of 700 was outnumbered by up to 10,000 visitors.\n\n\"We have really tried a lot in terms of visitor management. But we have reached a point where we're at the end of our possibilities,\" said Mayor Alexander Scheutz.\n\nThere are no set details on when such a system will come into force, or how much a ticket will cost, but it appears likely to go ahead after Austria's tourism minister, Susanne Kraus-Winkler, spoke in favour of a tourist cap in the hot spot.\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\n\nBritish stag groups have been told to \"stay away\", the city council has voted to ban cruise ships from docking there, and since 2019 the Netherlands tourist board has stopped actively promoting Amsterdam. Instead, it is trying to disperse visitors to lesser-visited corners such as the province of Zeeland or cities like Groningen.\n\nBased on previous form (there is already a tourist tax of seven per cent of the accommodation rate, plus \u20ac3 per person per night), it isn't unthinkable that Amsterdam might introduce an entry fee for day-trippers in the future. However, how such a thing would be managed is another question.", "source": {"uri": "ca.style.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAt 8.30am exactly, I walked through the checkpoint outside Santa Lucia station, the main entrance point for a city that has had enough of tourism.\n\nItaly's Liberation Day - the first day on which the new \u20ac5 (\u00a34.30) charge has been levied for day visitors between 8.30am and 4pm - is also the moment when the city authorities hope the tide will turn.\n\n\"Today we are starting the entry fee system to find the new balance between the residents of the community space and the daytrippers,\" Simone Venturini, deputy mayor for tourism for Venice, told The Independent.\n\n\"Day trippers can be, during some days of the year, overwhelming, and we are trying to keep the number of day trippers lower.\"\n\nAround 30 million tourists visit Venice in a typical year - with about seven out of 10 (or 21 million) staying only for the day. Just before the Covid pandemic, Unesco warned the city's \"status as a World Heritage property is in jeopardy\". The city official said that the scheme is aimed not at foreign visitors, but tourists from locations in northern Italy.\n\n\"The \u20ac5 will be paid mostly by short- and medium-range daytrippers - people who are living in Italy in the nearest region,\" Mr Venturini said.\n\n\"Venice is always here. They are always there. So they can pick another day to visit Venice.\" He said that the scheme is not designed to make money - but to act as a deterrent on peak days: \"Our goal is to collect very, very low taxes because it means that we have less daytrippers.\"\n\nThe deputy mayor rejected the suggestion that it is wrong to put a price on entering a Unesco World Heritage location such as Venice.\n\n\"I think that humanity has one duty to preserve and safeguard Venice. If this system helps us to do that, I think that the system is good.\"\n\nA line of kiosks has been set up outside Santa Lucia station for new arrivals to pay with cash or credit cards. The first customer was a retired US Army veteran, Mark Michanowicz from Nashville.\n\nHe said: \"The whole point here is to help Venice. I believe that the Venetians have suffered long enough with all the tourists every day coming in here. I think it's the right thing to do. I think every city in the world should do this and help each other.\n\n\"You're coming to visit this city. You come, you eat, you go to the bathroom and you leave and then who's cleaning up all this mess?\"\n\nMr Michanowicz said, if anything the charge is too low.\n\n\"I'd be willing to pay \u20ac10, I mean, what's 10 bucks? You're coming to visit a beautiful city and find out about it - why not help support it?\"\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2024, charges will apply on 25 days, starting with the 11 days from 25 April.\n\nVisits on the seven subsequent weekends, up to and including Sunday 14 July, will also be subject to the fee.

This is an unprecedented measure - it is the first city in the world to impose a tax of this type - that has a clear objective: to stand up to mass tourism that for too many years has threatened the fragile balance of the city of canals and expelled without restraint to its residents.\n\nThe figures are very graphic because, if there are only about 50,000 inhabitants on the islands of Venice - not counting those who live on the mainland -, on days of high pressure there can be 40,000 visitors at the same time in Venice. Last year alone 20 million tourists came to walk through its alleys. After having kicked out large cruise ships from the historic center in 2021, the La Serenissima City Council has now decided to opt for an original measure after UNESCO threatened to include the municipality on the black list of world heritage in danger.\n\nAt the moment it is all an experiment that will be in force on 29 designated dates in 2024, until July 14. It all starts today, April 25, which in Italy is a holiday commemorating the liberation of Nazi-fascism, and will continue for the next 10 days. What they hope to obtain with all this is to have more information about tourist flows to control services and at the same time dissuade visitors from traveling to Venice on the dates of greatest crowding of people.\n\nAll dates are marked in red on an online platform that the City Council has set up, where you can reserve your ticket and obtain a QR code necessary to walk in front of the canals during these days. Even parishioners who come on Sunday, when Pope Francis will hold a massive mass in San Marco Square, will have to download it.\n\n\"I have the honor of being mayor of the most beautiful city in the world, but in recent years it has had a problem with the quality of life of the people, with civility and with respect for the rules,\" defended the mayor, Luigi. Brugnaro, during a press conference with correspondents in Rome. No politician takes such a measure, because it is easier to stay still and not try to find a solution. \"We try to make the city more usable and livable.\"\n\nThe mayor has insisted that they do not intend to close the city as if it were an amusement park, and in fact, they do not plan to introduce barriers or turnstiles at the entrances such as the Santa Luc\u00eda train station, the Marco Polo airport or Piazzale Roma, where You can get there by car or bus. Six years ago, a test was carried out with turnstiles to regulate access flows and it turned out to be a complete disaster: they barely lasted half an hour after a group of protesters tore them off in front of the cameras.\n\nFor now, those in charge of controlling the access fee will be a team of 180 people, including volunteers and municipal workers, who will be able to ask tourists for the QR code. Those who are not in compliance risk a fine of between 50 and 300 euros. \"It is not a measure that I take lightly, but if we continue talking we will never do anything to preserve the delicacy and beauty of Venice,\" Mayor Brugnaro insisted. When the experimentation period ends, the intention is to open a time of reflection to study how the measure has gone and introduce the necessary improvements.\n\nThere are no reductions in the amount of 5 euros - initially the idea of imposing a price of 10 was considered - but there is a long list of exemptions. Starting with those under 14 years of age, the Venetians or those who come every day to work or study at their universities. Nor will relatives up to the third degree or friends have to pay it - they can prove it with a voucher that their loved ones will provide them -, residents of the Veneto region, or those who come to participate in sports competitions or to the hospital. Those who have a reservation for a hotel or other tourist accommodation structure simply enter it into the system, since they already pay the corresponding municipal tourist tax there. The idea is that only visitors who go to Venice to spend the day need the ticket, and contribute to the municipal coffers of a city under enormous tourist pressure.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Venice"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnstile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Roma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/04/_4583c.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-14", "textStart": 1274, "textEnd": 1281}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1304, "textEnd": 1312}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

So it's no surprise that a pilot scheme charging day-trippers \u20ac5 if they arrive there between 8.30am and 4pm has caused an outcry.\n\nWhat is surprising, though, is that the protests are coming from Venice's residents, rather than its tourists.\n\nAfter all, won't the tolls raise money for the city? And won't it - as its mayor has said is his aim - spread out the waves of sightseers who swarm its picturesque squares by nudging them not to all visit at the same time?\n\nWhy aren't Venetians rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of being able to pop to the corner shop without having to shove hordes of gawping Brits out of the way?\n\nI got back from Venice on Saturday, before the tax kicked in. I'd been there for the opening week of the city's 60th Biennale, an extravaganza of art, architecture, literature and cinema. And while the tourist quota was given over to hipsters rather than fanny-pack-wearing Floridians, there's no question that the city was overwhelmed by its visitors.\n\nEvery year, 20 million people visit, outnumbering residents by more than 400 to one. The lagoon city is kept afloat almost entirely by tourism; ironically, it's also what's sinking it.\n\nIts main island has lost 120,000 residents since the 1950s, when a focus on mass tourism rather than other economies pushed locals to up sticks. The fewer residents it has, the more Venice must rely on tourism; the more the city relies on tourism, the less that people will want to live there.\n\nSpotting a Venetian last week felt like playing an Italian version of Where's Wally? - or Do'v\u00e9 Giovanni?, perhaps. And yet, while thinning out the crowds would surely make things nicer for locals and visitors alike, residents are resistant to the new charge.\n\nTheir argument goes to the heart of what Venice is. For a city that's already teetering dangerously close to \"historical curiosity\", charging entry seems like the final nail in the coffin - a concession to the idea of it as a huge, floating theme park, rather than a thriving entity in its own right. As campaigner Marina Rodino told AFP: \"[Venice] is not a museum. It is not Pompeii.\"\n\nAnd for most visitors, \u20ac5 (about \u00a34.29) isn't much of a deterrent when just walking around can quickly become ruinously expensive anyway. From the gelato (beautiful) to the spaghetti alle vongole (extremely variable), the museums and the gondolas to the novelty hats and masks in shop windows, the city is already calibrated to extract as much money from you as possible. After a weekend of rinsing your overdraft for sub-par pasta, what's \u20ac5 more?\n\nEven if the city's identity crisis could be overcome, the fact remains that \u20ac5 is not enough to put off anyone but the very poorest.\n\nAnd with an entrance fee, the city is one step closer to being ossified under layers of tourist ash. For Venice to have any hope of staying vibrant rather than vitrined, much more profound measures - affordable housing, limits on Airbnbs, subsidies for local businesses - will be required.\n\nThe question for its government will be whether they can afford to make such investments, especially when the other option - charging visitors - looks likely to net huge returns.\n\nYet any profits would surely be short term. What makes Venice so extraordinary is that it is alive. Beneath the layers of tourists, a unique culture and breathtaking intersection of past and present constitute the heady cocktail that draws them in in the first place; that's worth infinitely more than a \u20ac5 fee.\n\nBut turn Venice into a museum, and eventually people will stop visiting at all.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_watkins@inews.co.uk", "name": "Emily Watkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraxinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toll road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where's_Wally?", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Where's Wally?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hipster (contemporary subculture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radiocarbon dating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelato", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(contract)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concession (contract)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaghetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gondola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pompeii"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Museum_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Museum Stores", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEI_201384331.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C2500px%2C1411px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

In a move aimed at curbing the strain of mass tourism on the beloved Italian city, visitors arriving for the day will now be required to purchase a five-euro ($5.3) ticket.\n\nStarting this Thursday, which coincides with a public holiday in Italy, inspectors stationed at key entry points within the UNESCO World Heritage site will monitor the implementation of this novel approach. The measure comes as Venice grapples with a staggering number of tourists, surpassing 3.2 million overnight stays in the historic center alone in 2022, a stark contrast to its resident population of just 50,000.\n\nOften inundated by tens of thousands of day trippers, many arriving via cruise ships, Venice's narrow streets and iconic landmarks like St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge bear the brunt of the tourist influx. The introduction of day trip tickets aims to encourage visitors to explore during quieter periods, thus alleviating the strain of overcrowding.\n\nInitially, the ticketing requirement will be enforced on 29 busy days throughout 2024, predominantly on weekends from May to July. The initiative serves as a test case amid global concerns over surging tourist numbers, which pose challenges to local economies and threaten the sustainability of communities and cultural heritage sites.\n\nMayor Luigi Brugnaro views the ticketing system as an experiment to enhance the livability of Venice. Despite initial resistance over fears of revenue loss and restricted mobility, the city ultimately embraced the measure to address mounting pressure from UNESCO and environmental concerns, including rising water levels attributed to climate change.\n\nWith assurances of minimal disruptions, the implementation of the new system will involve discreet checks by controllers stationed at key entry points. Visitors found without tickets will have the option to purchase one on-site, though failure to comply may result in fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.\n\nDubbed the \"Venice Access Fee,\" the measure applies exclusively to day tourists entering the old town between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm, with exemptions for hotel guests, minors under 14, and individuals with disabilities.

Overnight visitors are exempt from the scheme as they already pay a tourist tax of between one and five euros per night.\n\nTourists who are just visiting Venice's islands, including the Lido and Murano, will not need a ticket. The fee does not apply to children under 14, as well as residents, homeowners, students and workers.\n\nMass tourism is a huge issue for Venice, a UNESCO world heritage site with a local population of around 50,000 people, as millions of tourists descend upon the city to visit famous sites such as St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.

Residence, overnight visitors, students, and children under 14 are exempt from the entry fee.\n\nTickets are purchasable online and random checkpoints have been established across five of the city's main points of entry, including the train station at Santa Lucia. No ticket? Expect a fine of between \u20ac30 and \u20ac500.\n\nAccording to the Venice council 5,500 people booked a ticket for the April 25, which happens to be an Italian national holiday.

It also offered three years of tax breaks to landlords of short-term holiday lets who start offering ordinary leases for residents.\n\nThe city's famous museum, the Uffizi, offers discounts to people who arrive before 8.55 a.m. and lower prices off-season. To spread out crowds, it also closes at 10 p.m. once a week.\n\nCinque Terrer overtourism\n\nThe five villages that make up the Cinque Terre on the Italian Riviera regularly get swamped with visitors.\n\nTo try to reduce the overcrowding at peak periods, the authority which oversees the area said this week it would charge visitors 15 euros (about $16) to walk the most celebrated coastal path. In addition, the path can only be walked in one direction.\n\nCapri tourism measure\n\nThe picturesque small island that lies across the bay from the southern city of Naples has doubled its entry fee, which is automatically added to ferry tickets, to 5 euros.

This initiative will be first enforced on a public holiday in Italy, with day tourists needing to purchase a \u20ac5 ticket. These measures have been introduced to manage the inflow of tourists, particularly on select busy days, including public holidays and weekends from May to July 2024.\n\nVenice, a leading global tourist destination, experienced over 3.2 million overnight stays in its historic center in 2022, a number that vastly exceeds its local population of 50,000. Additionally, tens of thousands of visitors flood the city daily, many disembarking from cruise ships to visit famous landmarks like St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.\n\nThe ticketing initiative is part of Venice's broader strategy to distribute tourist visits more evenly over time, thereby reducing peak congestion. The city, made up of over 100 small islands, is a UNESCO World Heritage site noted for its extraordinary architecture and cultural significance. However, challenges like mass tourism and environmental threats have prompted concerns about its sustainability.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Venice has also introduced other regulatory measures, including a ban on large cruise ships and a tax on overnight stays. The entry fee system, termed the \"Venice Access Fee,\" is limited to day visitors arriving between 8.30 am and 4 pm, excluding hotel guests, minors under 14, and the disabled.\n\nThis system is closely monitored worldwide as other popular destinations grapple with similar issues of overtourism, which can strain local resources and harm cultural sites.

The city council is running a pilot project until mid July to see if it can make the system work.\n\nAnybody visiting Venice as a tourist for the day - except those who live in the local Veneto region - must pay the 5 euro ($5.40) charge if they arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m..\n\nTourists staying overnight don't have to pay, as an overnight tax is already added to their accommodation bills. However they too will have to register their presence to request an exemption to the fee. Essentially, anyone entering the city on dates the fee is charged must carry either a ticket or an exemption. The only exceptions are residents of Venice and people who were born there.\n\nA representative from the tourist board told CNN that 82,000 have registered for entry for the first day - a national holiday in Italy - but on average only one in 10 have paid the fee.\n\nAccording to local Il Gazzettino newspaper, which broke down the figures, only 7,266 people had paid the fee. Everyone else had registered exemptions: over 30,000 hotel guests, 15,000 commuters, 11,000 students and nearly 10,000 Veneto residents.\n\nThe registration scheme has spotlit the housing problems for residents - on the first day alone, 5,300 people had registered to enter the city as second home owners. Venetian residents now number less than 50,000, with tens of thousands squeezed out of the city to make room for second homes and Airbnbs.\n\nThe rest of the numbers are made up of school trips and guests of residents.\n\nIn preparation for the first day, the council has spent the past few days setting up checkpoints outside the train and bus terminals, with separate lines for residents, exemptions and those paying the fee. There is also a booth outside the train station for arrivals to pay the fee or register an exemption.\n\nThe fee will be charged on 29 days between now and July 14. After that, mayor of Venice Luigi Brugnaro has said that they will review how the pilot project has gone before they decide how to continue.\n\nThe fee has proved controversial with Venetians who fear that it risks turning the city into a theme park, and dislike the idea of having to register any guests.\n\nThe tourist board spokesperson added that a further 80,000 people have registered to enter the city on Friday, and more on Saturday. Generally on national holidays, over 100,000 day-trippers can pour into the beleaguered city - trebling the regular occupancy.\n\nAs some locals geared up to protest the introduction of the fee, fully booked trains were pouring into the city from Milan and Rome.\n\nPaolo Brandolisio, who makes oars and forcole (Venice's famous rowlocks for gondolas) told CNN that he doesn't think the fee will help the city under siege from overtourism.\n\n\"They're not putting an upper limit for entry, and today 80,000 people have booked - it'll be a nightmare,\" he said.\n\n\"What happens if 150,000 people book and they have to let them in? They say that people's freedom must be respected, but that they must pay.

However, it isn't the only place in Italy that has recently introduced new measures aimed at slowing tourist flows.\n\nHere are some of the initiatives currently in force. VENICE\n\nThe lagoon city has introduced tickets for day trippers that cost 5 euros and are valid from 0830 to 1600 local time. The experiment came into force on April 25, a national holiday in Italy. Tickets will be needed for the following 10 days and thereafter for most weekends until mid-July. Venice residents, students, workers and home owners are exempt from paying or booking a slot. Visitors aged under 14 and tourists with hotel reservations will need to be registered, but access for them will be free of charge.\n\nOther cities, such as Como, have said they are considering introducing a similar measure, but are waiting to see how the Venice initiative works before deciding. Besides this, Venice has also said that from June it will limit the size of tourist groups to 25 people and ban the use of loudspeakers by tour guides.\n\nFLORENCE Florence announced in October it was banning new short-term residential lets on platforms such as Airbnb in its historic centre. It also offered three years of tax breaks to landlords of short-term holiday lets if they start offering ordinary leases for residents.\n\nThe city's famous museum, the Uffizi, offers discounts to people who arrive before 8.55 a.m. and lower prices off-season. To spread out crowds, it also closes at 10 p.m. once a week. CINQUE TERRE\n\nThe five villages that make up the Cinque Terre on the Italian Rivieria regularly get swamped with visitors. To try to reduce the overcrowding at peak periods, the authority which oversees the area said this week it would charge visitors 15 euros to walk the most celebrated coastal path. In addition, the path can only be walked in one direction.\n\nCAPRI The picturesque small island that lies across the bay from the southern city of Naples has doubled its entry fee, which is automatically added to ferry tickets, to 5 euros. The fee will be charged from April 1 to October 1.\n\nCAPRI, ISCHIA, PROCIDA, LAMPEDUSA, LINOSA These islands have introduced limits, or outright bans, on cars for non-residents during the main tourist season.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Como"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Como"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinque_Terre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinque Terre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffizi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uffizi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Procida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampedusa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lampedusa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lampedusa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linosa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linosa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Linosa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/12_11_2020_11_20_52_1499489.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "dateEnd": "-10-01", "textStart": 2395, "textEnd": 2415}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 687, "textEnd": 695}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Already at the city's main train station, a separate entrance for tourists has been erected, and officials in yellow vests were roaming around to check the fee had been paid.\n\nThe fine for not paying is between 50 and 300 euros (C$73 to C$440). The fee can also be paid in person for the time being.\n\nThere are exemptions for the fee, though. Residents, workers and students are exempt, as well as those under 14 years old and those staying within the city's jurisdiction, which includes mainland districts.\n\nThe fee is only required on select dates and between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time. Outside those hours entry into the city is free.\n\nThose who are exempt will have to download a pass online to prove so at the checkpoints, which have a separate entrance for students, residents and workers.\n\nThe fee is designed to tackle the large number of visitors to the city, as stats show that tourist beds outnumbered residential ones in 2023. The number of day visitors to the city, which is marked by narrow streets flanked by waterways and canals, has led to overcrowding, with police necessary to direct foot traffic.\n\nThe city estimates it receives about 30,000 to 40,000 day visitors daily, and about 25 to 30 million arrivals a year. That's in comparison to the about 50,000 residents living in the city's historic centre.\n\nEven though residents are exempt from the fee, some are protesting it, saying it is not the right route to tackle the city's issues. Some argue the city should focus instead on limiting short-term rentals and boosting its residential population.\n\n\"Putting a ticket to enter a city will not decrease not even by one single unit the number of visitors that are coming,'' activist and protest organizer Tommaso Cacciari told The Associated Press.\n\n\"You pay a ticket to take the metro, to go to a museum, an amusement park. You don't pay a ticket to enter a city.

Residents, students and workers are exempt.\n\nAlthough there are no turnstiles at the city gateways, inspectors will be making random checks and issuing fines of between 50 and 300 euros to anyone who has failed to register.\n\nSome 20 million people visited Venice last year, a city official said, with roughly half of them staying overnight in hotels or holiday lets - an influx which dwarfs the resident population currently put at around 49,000.\n\nBesides introducing the entry charge, the city has also banned large cruise ships from sailing into the Venetian lagoon and has announced new limits on the size of tourist groups.", "source": {"uri": "armenpress.am", "dataType": "news", "title": "armenpress.am"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Train station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venetian Lagoon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnstile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Canals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Canals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal_Design", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal Design", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://armenpress.am/static/news/b/2024/04/1135693.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 17, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

A steward guided the couple through the online process, which took about 10 minutes.\n\n\"I knew about the new tax and the exemption but I didn't know we would be doing this when we arrived,\" said McKenna. \"It does seem to take a long time ... Imagine if you weren't so up on all the technology.\"\n\nAs more trains arrived at the station, Mehan pondered how easy it would be to manage the controls in high season. \"I understand why they're trying to do it, but it feels as though it could be a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nNatalie Liddell, a visitor from York who was in Venice for the first time, said: \"It is very confusing. When we got to the hotel they said something about this, but we didn't quite get what they were talking about. But I don't think \u20ac5 is going to put people off.\"\n\nOthers were totally oblivious to the new measure. \"What fee?\" asked Elizabeth from the US, before being shown how to pay online.\n\nThe initiative has been bitterly contested in Venice, with opponents arguing that it is against the principle of freedom of movement and will do nothing to meaningfully address over-tourism.\n\nVenice's main island, where the measure applies, attracted 3.2 million overnight visitors in 2022. On the busiest days, an average 40,000 day trippers arrive in the city.\n\nThere was tension between police dressed in riot gear and the estimated 500 people protesting against the fee at Piazzale Roma, where Venice's main bus terminal is.\n\nFederica Toninello, one of the protest's organisers, said: \"None of the measures done by this council cater to the necessities of residents. It's just tourism and speculation, this is why we're angry.\"\n\nToninello said that even though Venetians were exempt, the measure still affected their everyday lives as they had to prove they were not liable for the charge, and were subjected to checks. Likewise, commuters or students had to endure the \"impracticality\" of obtaining a QR code.\n\nGuido Sattin, an activist from Arci, handed out \"symbolic passports\" to tourists outside the station as a way of highlighting the \"dubious constitutional legitimacy\" of the measure in terms of restricting free movement.\n\n\"This sets a dangerous precedence,\" he said. \"We are the only city in the world that you have to pay to enter. This goes against the Italian constitution and the European principle of freedom of movement.\"\n\nSimone Venturini, Venice's councillor for tourism, defended the council's move. \"These protesters consider us to be the enemy,\" he said. \"This is not a magic wand measure, but after 60 years of talking about how to manage tourism, this is the first time anyone has taken action.\"\n\nVenturini said the fee was mostly aimed at deterring Italian day trippers. \"For example, a lot of Italians come to the nearby beaches in summer and, on a rainy day, they overwhelm Venice. Yes, the majority are from Veneto and are exempt, but the fact they still have to go online to confirm this is a way to disincentivise them.\"\n\nJana Plevova, from Prague, sympathised with the residents' plight, but supported the fee. She was spending five nights in the city and so was exempt, as she already paid a nightly tourist tax, but said she would have no concerns about paying to enter for the day.\n\nShe said: \"Prague is also suffering from over-tourism, so paying \u20ac5 is not that much for trying to preserve this beauty and architecture.\"\n\nEdel, from Ireland, said: \"For me, \u20ac5 is nothing if you really want to come.\" Her husband, John, was more sceptical. \"It'll be \u20ac5 this year, \u20ac10 next ... Who knows what the price will be in a few years' time? Venice will stop living off its good name and start being seen as a rip-off.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Roma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Piazzale Roma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/1a1d27d01d83d548221834cc6527b1c8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503952", "eventUri": "eng-9503952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-14", "textStart": 564, "textEnd": 571}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

We think of an idealised Venice, trapped in the Renaissance. Many of us do not consider Venice in terms of modernity and would much rather consider it in antiquity. However, Venice is in the present, as much as London, New York, and even Coventry. It therefore faces modern issues too, and none more so than the issue of climate change.\n\nAfter staying in Venice for a week, as part of a University pilot programme based around the concept of \"resilience\", I witnessed the environmental issues that Venice faces first-hand. The trip, coordinated by Dr. Marta Guerriero and Dr. David Lees (and to whom I am immensely grateful for the opportunity), highlighted that central to these issues are rising sea levels. The issue of rising water levels poses a real threat to Venice, with St. Mark's Square, the centre of Venetian history and contemporary tourism, being only twenty-five inches above the level of the lagoon. In addition to this, rising sea levels also pose a threat to trade and residential areas. The extraction of resources and use of canals by boats is deepening the canal and the deeper the canal, the higher the wave that could potentially strike Venice.\n\nThe former city-state has been dealing with the issue of rising sea levels and exceptionally high tides... for centuries\n\nWhilst Venice should be considered in the current moment, contrary to most of its representations, the former city-state has been dealing with the issue of rising sea levels and exceptionally high tides, or Acqua Alta for centuries. This clearly illustrates how climate change has always been an issue in the Anthropocene, and that humans have had to respond to it and show resilience before us. We cannot ignore the problem of climate change now, claiming those in the past never cared or acted, because that is simply not true. It is in this context, that avenues of possibility can open up, providing the possibility for us to learn from the past to face present issues.\n\nIn Venetian antiquity, the issue of water has been both a cure and a curse to the settlement. One way Venetians sought to adapt to dealing with increased water was the creation of cisterns to collect rainwater. These cisterns used sand as a form of filtration to desalinate and purify rainwater. A simple concept, granted, but one which proved effective in two ways: preventing overflow, but also generating clean, drinkable water. In addition to cisterns, canal maintenance has occurred regularly for centuries, involving draining parts of the canals to remove debris and create more capacity in the canals. In this sense, we can see examples in history of areas in the city adapting and catering urban planning to the issues of the climate.\n\nVenice has led the way in providing opportunities for adaptation to issues of the environment\n\nThe 18th century in Venice provided another perfect example of adaptation in response to climate change. The construction of the Murazzi (made of Istrian stone) as a wall of sea defence for Venice has created long-term effects, which are enabling Venice to attempt to thrive to this day. One of these long-term effects is the defence at the Lido leading to more sand collecting, which is widening the beach and creating more space for urban planning and development. This has been capitalised on by modern trade as the Lido currently hosts the Venice Film Festival, which brings in large amounts of revenue to the city.\n\nAs we can see, throughout history, Venice has led the way in providing opportunities for adaptation to issues of the environment. However, it is the current efforts taking place in Venice that are under the spotlight across the climate science community. Central to these modern attempts of climate resilience is the Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico or MOSE project. The MOSE is a collection of mobile gates on the sea floor around Venice, which can be raised in around 30 minutes to repel the exceptionally high tides when they occur. The MOSE project is an attempt to adapt, with the potential of protecting Venetian heritage.\n\na prime case study to understand the interactions of humans and nature throughout the Anthropocene\n\nWhilst staying in Venice, a group of us had the pleasure of meeting with and learning from Venetian engineer and social ecologist Giovanni Cecconi, the President of the Venice Resilience Lab and former control room manager of the MOSE. Giovanni engaged in the planning and construction of the MOSE and currently offers tours of the wider lagoon, to teach about the environmental issues that Venice faces. Central to Giovanni's message was the concept of agency. He stressed, throughout his talk and practical demonstrations, the importance of agency, unity, and solidarity in facing the issues of climate change. He also emphasised the need for people from all ages and socio-economic backgrounds to cooperate in order to mitigate climate issues, a message that everyone in the room took away.\n\nGiovanni calls Venice a \"laboratory of social ecology\", a prime case study to understand the interactions of humans and nature throughout the Anthropocene. From visiting myself, I now too, believe this. Venice is a complex city, with the competing interests of tourism, local trade, industry, and calls for environmental protection. However, if one thing is to be taken away from the Venetian experience for all to learn, is that socioecological harmony, and a willingness to learn from the past, and all of its outlets, is and will be crucial in facing the socioenvironmental issues that stand in front of our civilisation.", "source": {"uri": "theboar.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boar"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Matteo Secchi, who leads residents activist group Venessia.com, told The Guardian: \"I can tell you that almost the entire city is against it.

Europe's fight against overtourism", "body": "European tourist hotspots like Amsterdam and Venice, which introduces new measures on Thursday, are on a crusade to deal with surging visitor numbers.\n\n- Venice -\n\nIn Venice, one of the world's top tourist destinations, 3.2 million visitors stayed overnight in the historic centre in 2022 -- dwarfing the resident population of just 50,000.\n\nOn Thursday, it will start charging day trippers for entry. Day visitors will have to buy a five-euro ($5.3) ticket, monitored by inspectors carrying out spot checks at key points across the UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nIn 2021, it banned huge cruise ships from Venice lagoon over concerns about the environmental impact of the huge liners on the city.\n\nVenice has also introduced a tax for overnight visitors.\n\n- Amsterdam -\n\nAmsterdam has long been trying to clean up a reputation for rowdy stag parties, drugs and sex that has been partly blamed on an influx of around 20 million visitors a year.\n\nIn 2023 it launched an online campaign aimed at discouraging young British men from travelling to Amsterdam to get high or very drunk, telling them in typically blunt Dutch fashion to \"stay away\" or risk arrest.\n\nAmsterdam also announced last week a ban on new hotels and that it would halve the number of river cruise ships in the city within five years.\n\nIt also decided last year to ban smoking cannabis on the streets of the red-light district.\n\n- Dubrovnik -\n\nCroatia's medieval walled city of Dubrovnik is one of Europe's most overcrowded cities, with the flow of tourists sometimes making it impossible to walk inside the historic Old Town.\n\nThe jewel of the Adriatic has seen a huge surge in visitor numbers since scenes from the series \"Game of Thrones\" were filmed on its ramparts in 2011.\n\nIn 2023, the town of 41,000 people received 1.2 million tourists, below 2019's record of 1.4 million.\n\nIn 2019 local authorities limited the number of cruise ship arrivals to two per day, with no more than 4,000 passengers each at a time.\n\nThey also launched an app that uses machine learning and weather forecasts to predict when the Old Town, a UNESCO world heritage site, will be busiest.\n\n- Barcelona -\n\nNestled on the coast of the Mediterranean, Barcelona is the capital of the Catalonia region, home to famed Gaudi architectural gems and one of Spain's top football clubs.\n\nAda Colau, the leftist former housing rights activist who was mayor of the city between 2015 and June 2023, cracked down on illegal Airbnb rentals that were accused of pricing locals out of the property market.\n\nThe city also limited the entrance of tour groups in the historic La Boqueria market, especially during peak shopping times.\n\nAnd throughout the centre organised groups must be limited to a maximum of 20 people and guides are not allowed to use loudspeakers.\n\nIn 2023 tourist numbers registering in hotels, homes and hostels were down 6.9 percent compared with 2019 figures, according to the City Council.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Agence

The charge kicked in at 8.30am on Thursday and will apply on 29 peak days until 14 July as part of a trial phase.\n\nMost of the day-trippers arriving at Santa Lucia station came pre-prepared with a QR code proving they had paid the \u20ac5 toll, but the initiative caused confusion among people staying in hotels who were unaware they had to go through the rigmarole of confirming their exemption online.\n\nShowing proof of a hotel booking is not enough, as Yvonne McKenna and Ken Mehan, visitors from Ireland who had arrived on an overnight train from Vienna, learned. A steward guided the couple through the online process, which took about 10 minutes.\n\n\"I knew about the new tax and the exemption but I didn't know we would be doing this when we arrived,\" said McKenna. \"It does seem to take a long time ... Imagine if you weren't so up on all the technology?\"\n\nAs more trains arrived at the station, Mehan pondered how easy it will be to manage the controls in high season. \"I understand why they're trying to do it, but it feels as though it could be a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nNatalie Liddell, a visitor from York in Venice for the first time, said: \"It is very confusing. When we got to the hotel they said something about this, but we didn't quite get what they were talking about. But I don't think \u20ac5 is going to put people off.\"\n\nOthers were totally oblivious to the new measure. \"What fee?\" asked Elizabeth from the US, before being taught how to pay online.\n\nThe initiative has been bitterly contested in Venice, with opponents arguing that it is against the principle of freedom of movement and will do nothing to meaningfully address over-tourism.\n\nVenice's main island, where the measure applies, attracted 3.2 million overnight visitors in 2022. On the busiest days, an average 40,000 day-trippers arrive in the city.\n\nThere was tension between police dressed in riot gear and the estimated 500 people protesting against the fee at Piazzale Roma, where Venice's main bus terminal is.\n\nFederica Toninello, one of the protest's organisers, said: \"None of the measures done by this council cater to the necessities of residents - it's just tourism and speculation, this is why we're angry.\"\n\nToninello said that even though Venetians are exempt, the measure still affects their everyday lives as they have to prove they are not liable for the charge and are subjected to checks. Likewise, commuters or students have to endure \"the impracticality\" of obtaining a QR code.\n\nGuido Sattin, an activist from Arci, handed out \"symbolic passports\" to tourists outside the station as a way of highlighting the \"dubious constitutional legitimacy\" of the measure in terms of restricting free movement.\n\n\"This sets a dangerous precedence,\" he said. \"We are the only city in the world that you have to pay to enter. This goes against the Italian constitution and the European principle of freedom of movement.\"\n\nSimone Venturini, Venice's tourism councillor, defended the council's move. \"These protesters consider us to be the enemy,\" he said. \"This is not a magic wand measure, but after 60 years of talking about how to manage tourism, this is the first time anyone has taken action.\"\n\nVenturini said the fee was mostly aimed at deterring Italian day-trippers. \"For example, a lot of Italians come to the nearby beaches in summer and on a rainy day, they overwhelm Venice. Yes, the majority are from Veneto and are exempt, but the fact they still have to go online to confirm this is a way to disincentivise them.\"\n\nJana Plevova, from Prague, sympathised with the residents' plight, but supports the fee.

This is a bad image for Venice ... Are we joking?\".\n\nFederica Tonielo, who heads the ASC, an association for housing, stressed that: \"5 euros will do nothing to deter people. Day trippers are not the problem. The problem is the lack of affordable housing. What we need are policies to help residents, for example, setting rules to restrict things like Airbnb.\"\n\nFor its part, the city points out that as of today, April 25, the first day of implementation of the measure, 5,500 people had booked tickets, bringing in 27,500 euros to the city's coffers. They also say the authorities say that if the scheme is successful, municipal fees will be reduced.\n\nSee Also\n\nNorth Macedonia: Clear victory for opposition VMRO-DPMNE candidate in the first round of elections\n\nUnder the new regulations, a fee will be imposed on tourists passing through the city without staying overnight.\n\nThe scheme will only apply for 29 days until 14 July, for certain hours of the day.

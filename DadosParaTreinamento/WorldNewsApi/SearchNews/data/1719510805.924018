I\u2019m super-excited to play in this event, because I\u2019ve never played this Jack Nicklaus-designed course that I\u2019ve heard so many great things about and, well, it\u2019s a fun tournament. After a good breakfast the next morning, we head over to the golf course to check in \u2014 pulling into the driveway and up to the registration table. The staffers hand each of us a nice cap, a dozen Titleist Pro V1 balls, and a color-coded KitchenAid money clip that we are instructed to attach to our clothing somewhere visible for access around the property. Volunteers quickly disappear with our golf bags and tell us we\u2019ll find them in the participants\u2019 cart staging area. About 15 minutes later, I grab a few clubs and head towards the driving range. But there's confusion as I take a step onto the range. \"Sir, this area is for tour pros only,\" says the attendant, as he checks the money clip attached to my pants pocket. \"Oh sorry \u2014 where do schlubs like me go?,\" I ask. He points to the opposite end of the practice facility, a good 300 yards away. But it\u2019s a beautiful Tuesday, so I don\u2019t mind the walk to hit a couple dozen balls and loosen up. Then I make my way back to the staging area. Ducking into the hospitality tent, I grab a few snacks and head back to the cart. Soon it\u2019s go time. We caravan with all of the other groups out to our respective tees for this shotgun start. When we get to 13, our starting hole, Pavin greets us. He\u2019s a super friendly and very personable man with a great sense of humor, as we would learn over the next few hours. While the carts got us to the tee, we walk the entire course from that point. Each of us is supplied a caddie, who are mostly local volunteers that each get paid $150 for the effort. My caddie John is actually a local business executive and former host of the popular \u201cMorning After\u201d radio show in Western Michigan. But he loves golf and this is his way of staying connected to the event.

At that point, we\u2019re told that we\u2019re in dead last place out of the 18 groups. And then we ignite the afterburners. Each of us amateurs make natural birdies. By the time we\u2019re through 15 holes, we are 9 under par. And then Pavin kicks into gear with an eagle and two birdies \u2014 one of which was a near-hole-in-one that lands one inch from the cup. We finish 13 under and in sole possession of second place. Although we\u2019re able to mark several closest-to-the-pins and long drives among our group on several holes as we play them, other people must've bested us afterwards as we won no prizes for those. We did get to pick a very nice participation gift later on from an online catalog. Plenty of beautiful scenery at Harbor Shores Scott Kramer As for the overall experience, I learned a few things. Along the way, there were hospitality coolers at several locations on the course, as well as a couple of food stations. Officials definitely didn't want anyone to go hungry. There was also a reception after the round that was well catered. At one point, I hit my third bad tee shot in a row. Pavin came up to me, put his arm around my shoulders, and told me to just slow down my back swing. From that point on, I couldn't miss. He really was conversational with each of us, taking us aside and asking us questions about our lives. When I returned the favor, he told me that his parents got him into golf at age 6. His father \u2014 who owned several shoe stores in Southern California \u2014 was never a great golfer. But his older brothers were playing and his parents thought he would enjoy the game playing with them. Pavin says he was just an average golfer until about age 15, when everything suddenly started clicking and he began winning junior tournaments. When he wasn't playing golf, he was selling shoes at his dad's stores. He went on to play golf at UCLA and eventually turned pro with much success. Waiting to tee off on one of the holes Scott Kramer Over our day with him, Pavin discussed everything from very entertaining stories of his PGA Tour days to sustainability to why he likes playing more with galleries than without to how golf balls would travel on Mars and the moon compared to Earth. Regardless, he was very approachable and was truly like having one of our buddies out there with us. Perhaps best of all, we got to play this top-ranked course while it was in near-perfect condition. The greens and fairways rolled true, and the course was challenging but fair. My caddie was able to provide a lot of incredible history about each hole and the course in general. I found Harbor Shores to be visually spectacular. I\u2019d heard so much about it for several years, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. At one point, the course is perched right above Lake Michigan with stunning panoramas. While it was a bummer that Mike Weir\u2019s group beat us out by I believe a stroke or two, it was a fantastic day that supported some great charities. And one I won't soon forget.

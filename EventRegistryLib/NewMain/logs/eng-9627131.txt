Interest Rates For 1St Time In Half Decade", "body": "European Central Bank is to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday, as estimates show cut of no less or more than 25 basis points.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to cut its benchmark interest rates for the first time in five years on Thursday when it will announce its decision, as the inflation in the eurozone is shadowed by the weak economic growth outlook.\n\nThe ECB's Governing Council is certain to cut refinancing, deposit, and marginal funding rates by 25 points to 4.25%, 3.75%, and 4.50%, respectively, marking it the first cut since March 2016 for refinancing and marginal funding rates, and since September 2019 for the deposit rate.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde stated that more clarity and sufficient data will be obtained until June after the Governing Council members highlighted the need to take action to cut interest rates before the Fed.\n\nThe annual inflation in the eurozone peaked at 10.6% in October 2022, and fell to 2.6% in May, which is not far from the ECB's 2% target.\n\nThe high energy costs stemmed from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, triggering the first surge in inflation.\n\nThe ECB expects less price pressure in the short- to medium-term, while estimating significantly weaker growth, according to the bank's latest macroeconomic forecasts, as it predicts a 0.4% decrease in inflation to 2.3% for 2025, and 1.9% inflation for 2026.\n\nWeak economic growth worries ECB more than inflation\n\nThe ECB reduced its estimates for the economic growth of the eurozone from 0.8% to 0.6% for 2024, but left estimates for 2025 and 2026 unchanged, at 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively.\n\nThe bank forecasts for the core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, declined from 2.7% to 2.6% for 2024, from 2.3% to 2.1% in 2025, and it stayed at 2% for 2026.\n\nThe ECB raised its interest rates to combat high inflation a total of 450 basis points in 10 consecutive meetings since July 2022, and it raised its deposit rate to 4% at its September 2023 meeting, keeping it unchanged at the meetings of October, December, January, March, and April.\n\nThe Fed started raising its rates in March 2022, four months before the ECB, when the global economy was recovering from the pandemic and inflation was on the rise, and currently, the Fed has yet to make a decision for a rate cut, and the ECB has a chance to lead by making the first cut.\n\nA possible rate cut on Thursday is expected to boost corporate earnings and positively impact stock prices, and as nominal rates will remain above the current inflation rate, a 25-basis point rate cut will also maintain positive real interest rates.\n\nThe eurozone's economy shrank 0.1% in both the third and fourth quarters of 2023, and the region saw a growth of 0.3% in the January-March 2024 period.\n\nNo continued rate cuts on horizon\n\nECB President Lagarde said on March 20 that the bank will probably have enough assurance to decide on the first rate cut in June of this year, though she made no promises for continued rate cuts.\n\nSimilarly, Joachim Nagel, president of Bundesbank and the ECB's Governing Council member, stated that inflation can be stubborn, and that the ECB cannot commit to what could happen after the first possible cut.\n\nThe ECB is now faced with the risks of cutting interests too much or too little, as the cyclical recovery in economic activity in the region, as well as structural labor shortage and upward pressure on wages, could put the bank's inflation projections at risk, analysts say.\n\nSo long as the ECB continues its restrictive monetary policy for too long, and cuts rates less than market expectations, it risks depressing economic growth.\n\nECB can cut rates only because it can, not because it needs to\n\nCarsten Brzeski, ING Germany's chief economist, said the ECB certainly will cut its interest rates, and anything other than a 25-basis point cut on Thursday would be a serious loss of reputation for the bank.\n\nBrzeski highlighted that the past rate cut cycles were often triggered by recession or a crisis, neither of which is what is experienced in the region, therefore, the bank can cut rates only because it can, and not because it needs to.\n\nHe said the recent improvements in economic confidence indicators, the upward movement of inflation, and the rise in wages could hinder a rate-cut decision.\n\nWriting by Emir Yildirim in Istanbul -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Although this marks the beginning of an easing cycle, the ECB remains cautious due to persistent inflation and wage pressures. The bank's future rate decisions will depend on upcoming economic data.\n\nThe European Central Bank cut interest rates for the first time in five years on Thursday but kept investors in the dark about its next move given increasing uncertainty over inflation after a sharp slowdown in the past year. The ECB lowered its record-high deposit rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, joining the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in starting to unwind some of the steepest rate hikes used to tame a post-pandemic inflation surge.\n\nThursday's well-flagged move is seen as the start of an easing cycle, but lingering price and wage pressures are clouding the outlook and may force the euro zone's central bank to wait months before cutting again. \"The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction,\" the ECB said in a statement.\n\nWhile the ECB kept open its options for July, a string of influential policymakers, including board member Isabel Schnabel and Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot have already made the case for a pause next month, suggesting the next window of opportunity for easing will be in September. Economists see another two rate cuts from the ECB this year, most likely in September and December, while markets are pricing in between one and two more moves - a big change from the start of the year, when more than five cuts were anticipated.\n\n\"Interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission,\" the ECB added. \"The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\" Conservative policymakers, who still appear to command a majority on the rate-setting Governing Council, have argued that the ECB is not in any hurry to cut since a rebound in the economy proves high rates are not choking off growth.\n\nPart of their caution may be due to unexpectedly stubborn inflation. Indeed, the ECB raised its 2025 inflation projection to 2.2% on Thursday from 2.0%. \"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\" the ECB said.\n\nSome economists say the biggest risk to the rate cut schedule is actually the U.S. Federal Reserve, not wages and inflation. The Fed has clearly signalled a delay in policy easing and a further delay in U.S. rate cuts is likely to make the ECB more cautious too, as a widening interest rate differential would weaken the euro and raise imported inflation.\n\nAttention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference, where she is likely to be grilled about the ECB's likely next moves.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas_Knot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaas Knot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Nederlandsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Nederlandsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_02_04_26_4599114.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

neither of which is what is experienced in the region, therefore, the bank can cut rates only because it can, and not because it needs to.\n\nHe said the recent improvements in economic confidence indicators, the upward movement of inflation, and the rise in wages could hinder a rate-cut decision.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"},

It appears that moment has arrived.\n\nWhile inflation has not yet completely met the 2% target, its substantial decrease signals a continuing downward trend expected to persist in the coming months.\n\nAccording to the latest ECB projections from March 2024, the average inflation rate is expected to decrease to 2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. As for core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, projections see it at 2.1% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026.\n\nThe 25 basis points cut will also continue to maintain positive real interest rates, as nominal rates will remain above the current inflation rate. Thus, it indicates a reduction in the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness, rather than a broader normalisation.\n\nThe rising and elevated cost of borrowing has created a slowdown in the bloc's economic growth, containing demand to put a brake on price pressures.\n\nWhile the euro area's economy expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2024, the preceding two quarters were both marked by 0.1% contractions. The second quarter of 2023 saw a minor 0.1% growth, and the first quarter of 2023 and the last of 2022 saw stagnation.\n\nRecent remarks from ECB officials suggest that there will be no pre-commitment to future cuts afterward.\n\nThis means that a further rate cut in July remains uncertain, as the ECB aims to retain flexibility in its decisions and continue monitoring economic data.\n\nEurozone inflation edged higher in May, reaching 2.6%, above the expected 2.5%, while core inflation rose to 2.9% from 2.7% in April.\n\nWe expect President Lagarde to signal once again that more information will be available in July to guide the next decision, with even greater clarity expected by September.\n\nThe new June economic projections might suggest a slight upward adjustment in economic growth and inflation for 2024, while maintaining the 2% inflation forecast for 2025 unchanged.\n\nThe ECB faces the challenge of balancing the risks of cutting rates too much against those of cutting too little.\n\nIf Frankfurt eases monetary policy too quickly and significantly, it would likely boost consumer demand and investment. However, this could also risk rekindling inflationary pressures before the 2% target is fully achieved.\n\nThe ECB would expose itself to uncertainties related to energy prices and geopolitical tensions with reduced buffers, potentially leading to undesirable effects on price dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, while President Christine Lagarde stressed that the ECB is \"data-dependent and not Fed-dependent\", divergence between the policies of the world's two major central banks could have significant financial impacts, especially on exchange rates.\n\nAggressive rate cuts by the ECB while the Fed maintains higher-for-longer interest rates would put strong downward pressure on the euro against the dollar, risking further upward price pressure on imported goods and services.\n\nConversely, if Frankfurt maintains a restrictive monetary policy for too long and cuts rates less than the market currently expects, it risks choking economic growth in the eurozone and widening the gap with the United States.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/48/24/54/1200x675_cmsv2_b3cfd18f-1023-50b4-8c4d-b1a994c71601-8482454.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "textStart": 342, "textEnd": 352}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 504}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

However, the ECB will stress that the fight is not over due to persistent services prices. Further cuts will depend on incoming data, with economists divided on the decision's timing and impact.\n\nThe European Central Bank is all but certain to cut interest rates from record highs on Thursday and acknowledge it has made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight is not yet over given sticky services prices. ECB policymakers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States. This means that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they are expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs need to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation. \"Further cuts in September and December remain our central case,\" HSBC economist Fabio Balboni said in a note. \"But if the recent resilience in services inflation proves sustained, we see increasing chances that the ECB might have to be more cautious on the way down.\"\n\nAll 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% on Thursday from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019. But not all think it is a good idea.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\". \"If economic data did not support a rate cut back in March, they do even less today,\" Lorenzo Codogno at LC Macro Advisors said. \"Inflation has not declined as the ECB had expected, indices more linked to domestic demand have increased, wage growth has risen, and overall demand and GDP growth have strengthened.\"\n\nNO DECLARATION OF VICTORY ECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand.\n\nMost economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year, but markets only price one to two more moves, a big change compared to the start of the year when over five rate cuts were seen in 2024. But some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2% inflation than the ECB has been predicting -- a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nEuro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policymakers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1% from 3.7%, according to preliminary estimates. This was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may be the Fed, which has clearly signalled a delay to its own easing cycle, fuelling some caution in Frankfurt as well. \"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\"\n\nA rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB, and the bank will likely raise some growth forecasts on Thursday, negating the argument that high rates are choking economic activity. Still, new forecasts will continue to suggest inflation returning to the ECB's 2% goal next year, keeping the central bank on course for more easing barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\" (Editing by Toby Chopra and Sonali Paul)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from

inflation\n\n(Adds economists' comments in paragraphs 8, 12 and 19, updates market expectations in paragraph 21)\n\nBy Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi\n\nFRANKFURT, June 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is all but certain to cut interest rates from record highs on Thursday and acknowledge it has made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight is not yet over given sticky services prices.\n\nECB policymakers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis means that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they are expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs need to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"Further cuts in September and December remain our central case,\" HSBC economist Fabio Balboni said in a note. \"But if the recent resilience in services inflation proves sustained, we see increasing chances that the ECB might have to be more cautious on the way down.\"\n\nAll 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% on Thursday from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut not all think it is a good idea.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\".\n\n\"If economic data did not support a rate cut back in March, they do even less today,\" Lorenzo Codogno at LC Macro Advisors said. \"Inflation has not declined as the ECB had expected, indices more linked to domestic demand have increased, wage growth has risen, and overall demand and GDP growth have strengthened.\"\n\nNO DECLARATION OF VICTORY\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand.\n\nMost economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year, but markets only price one to two more moves, a big change compared to the start of the year when over five rate cuts were seen in 2024.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2% inflation than the ECB has been predicting -- a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nEuro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policymakers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1% from 3.7%, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nThis was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may be the Fed, which has clearly signalled a delay to its own easing cycle, fuelling some caution in Frankfurt as well.\n\n\"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn\u00b4t cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\"\n\nA rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB, and the bank will likely raise some growth forecasts on Thursday, negating the argument that high rates are choking economic activity.\n\nStill, new forecasts will continue to suggest inflation returning to the ECB's 2% goal next year, keeping the central bank on course for more easing barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\" (Editing by Toby Chopra and Sonali Paul)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Despite significant progress, challenges persist, leading to uncertainty in future rate paths. The ECB joins other central banks in adjusting policies amidst complex global economic conditions.\n\nThe European Central Bank went ahead with its first interest rate cut since 2019 on Thursday, citing progress in tackling inflation even as it acknowledged the fight was far from over. In new forecasts released with the widely flagged rate cut, the ECB said it expected inflation to average 2.2% in 2025 - up from a previous estimate of 2.0% and meaning it was now seen holding above the central bank's 2% target well into next year.\n\nInflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen to 2.6% from more than 10% in late 2022, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and an easing of post-pandemic supply snags. But that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that inflation may prove sticky, as it has in the United States.\n\nCutting its deposit rate to 3.75% from a record-high 4.0%, the ECB gave no indication whether that would be followed by a further easing in July. \"We are not pre-comitting to a particular rate path,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde told a press conference, reading from the Governing Council's statement.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\" While ECB policymakers signalled their confidence that inflation was gradually being tamed, there was also enough caution in their statement to convince some ECB-watchers that Thursday's cut would not be repeated at the next meeting.\n\n\"In our view, this suggests that it is unlikely we'll see back-to-back cuts in July,\" said Diego Iscaro, head of European economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Lagarde said only one Governing Council member had opposed the decision to cut rates. Three sources told Reuters that was Austrian central bank chief Robert Holzmann, who had cited the rise in inflation projections as grounds to stay put.\n\nWith Thursday's move the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history. Some commentators have questioned the logic of moving now, however, especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve has been stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings and is not expected to move till after the summer.\n\nLAST MILE Money market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after Thursday's announcement and only priced in one more, with a chance of a second, for the remainder of the year.\n\nAsked if the ECB was moving into a phase of \"dialling back\" its tight monetary policy stance, Lagarde said she could not confirm such a process was underway, but that there was \"a strong likelihood\". \"But it will be data-dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she added, noting there would be \"bumps on the road\" ahead.\n\nStronger-than-expected data about euro zone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to the ECB's goal - a concern expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel. Inflation in services, which some policymakers have singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, has been a particular concern after a rise to 4.1% in May from 3.7% a month earlier.\n\nAt the same time, a rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB by undermining the argument that high rates are choking economic activity. But the real elephant in the room may remain the Fed and whether it starts or further delays its own easing cycle.\n\nA more restrictive Fed would likely mean a weaker euro and higher imported inflation for the currency bloc, but it would also increase yields on global bond markets - a double whammy whose net effect is hard to predict. \"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies, said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\" (Editing by Toby Chopra, Sonali Paul and Catherine Evans)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Holzmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Holzmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_02_04_26_4599114.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

continues", "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Central Bank is all but certain to cut interest rates from record highs on Thursday and acknowledge it has made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight is not yet over given sticky services prices.\n\nECB policymakers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis means that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they are expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs need to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"Further cuts in September and December remain our central case,\" HSBC economist Fabio Balboni said in a note. \"But if the recent resilience in services inflation proves sustained, we see increasing chances that the ECB might have to be more cautious on the way down.\"\n\nAll 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% on Thursday from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut not all think it is a good idea.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\".\n\n\"If economic data did not support a rate cut back in March, they do even less today,\" Lorenzo Codogno at LC Macro Advisors said. \"Inflation has not declined as the ECB had expected, indices more linked to domestic demand have increased, wage growth has risen, and overall demand and GDP growth have strengthened.\"\n\nNO DECLARATION OF VICTORY\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand.\n\nMost economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year, but markets only price one to two more moves, a big change compared to the start of the year when over five rate cuts were seen in 2024.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2% inflation than the ECB has been predicting -- a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nEuro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policymakers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1% from 3.7%, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nThis was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may be the Fed, which has clearly signalled a delay to its own easing cycle, fuelling some caution in Frankfurt as well.\n\n\"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\"\n\nA rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB, and the bank will likely raise some growth forecasts on Thursday, negating the argument that high rates are choking economic activity.\n\nStill, new forecasts will continue to suggest inflation returning to the ECB's 2% goal next year, keeping the central bank on course for more easing barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"", "source": {"uri":

The question now is how far and how fast the ECB, Federal Reserve and other central bankers will go in lower their benchmarks, with inflation subsiding but not yet back to levels considered best for the economy.The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter point, moving ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve as central banks around the world lean toward lowering borrowing costs - a shift with far-reaching consequences for home buyers, savers and investors.\n\nThe ECB cut its benchmark rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4% at a meeting of the bank's 26-member rate-setting council in Frankfurt.\n\nThe ECB said in a statement that \"price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" allowing it to start loosening credit.\n\nThe question now is how far and how fast the ECB, Federal Reserve and other central bankers will go in lower their benchmarks, with inflation subsiding but not yet back to levels considered best for the economy.\n\nAnalysts say the quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy.\n\nWhile inflation at an annual rate of 2.6% in May is well down from peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months and inflation even ticked up slighly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde and other officials have made it clear that a quarter-point rate cut from the current record high of 4% is more than likely when the bank's 26-member governing council meets at the institution's skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nLagarde said late last month that she was \"really confident\" inflation was under control in the eurozone, the 20 European Union countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB sets monetary policy. Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday.\n\nSuch a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

inflation fight continues", "body": "ECB to cut deposit rate to 3.75% from 4.0%\n\n*\n\nLagarde likely to stress no room for complacency\n\n*\n\nRecent data points to stronger growth, inflation\n\nBy Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi\n\nFRANKFURT, June 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank was all but certain to cut interest rates from record highs on Thursday and was likely to acknowledge it had made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight was not yet over.\n\nECB policymakers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appeared more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis meant that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues were unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they were expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"The cut will set the new direction for policy but with economic momentum outperforming expectations and domestic inflation proving sticky in 2024, the ECB can afford to take things slowly and let the data set the parameters of the easing cycle,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAll 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% on Thursday from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut not all think it is a good idea.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\".\n\n\"The cost of waiting until September appears low while the benefit of getting more clarity on the inflation outlook appears high,\" Fuzesi added. \"For some reason, the ECB Governing Council, however, seems already to have decided many weeks ago to deliver a June cut.\"\n\nNO DECLARATION OF VICTORY\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand.\n\nMost economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year and money markets priced in between one and two more moves, possibly in September and December.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2% inflation than the ECB has been predicting -- a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nEuro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policymakers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1% from 3.7%, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nThis was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes.\n\n\"We\u00b4re still confident about services inflation coming down but there\u00b4s definitely a last-mile dynamic at play here,\" Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at BNP-Paribas, said.\n\nEconomic activity surveys have also pointed to a stronger-than-expected rebound by the economy after more than a year of stagnation, which is likely to force the ECB to increase its GDP forecast for this year when it publishes its new projections on Thursday.\n\nThese were still expected to point to inflation returning to the ECB's 2% goal next year, keeping the central bank

"title": "European Central Bank to start cutting rates even as inflation fight continues", "body": "The European Central Bank is all but certain to cut interest rates from record highs on Thursday and acknowledge it has made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight is not yet over given sticky services prices.\n\nECB policy-makers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10 per cent in late 2022 to just above their 2 per cent target in recent months.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis means that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they are expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs need to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"Further cuts in September and December remain our central case,\" HSBC economist Fabio Balboni said in a note. \"But if the recent resilience in services inflation proves sustained, we see increasing chances that the ECB might have to be more cautious on the way down.\"\n\nAll 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75 per cent on Thursday from a record 4.0 per cent, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut not all think it is a good idea.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\".\n\n\"If economic data did not support a rate cut back in March, they do even less today,\" Lorenzo Codogno at LC Macro Advisors said. \"Inflation has not declined as the ECB had expected, indices more linked to domestic demand have increased, wage growth has risen, and overall demand and GDP growth have strengthened.\"\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand.\n\nMost economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year, but markets only price one to two more moves, a big change compared to the start of the year when over five rate cuts were seen in 2024.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2 per cent inflation than the ECB has been predicting - a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nEuro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policy-makers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1 per cent from 3.7 per cent, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nThis was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may be the Fed, which has clearly signalled a delay to its own easing cycle, fuelling some caution in Frankfurt as well.\n\n\"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\"\n\nA rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB, and the bank will likely raise some growth forecasts on Thursday, negating the argument that high rates are choking economic activity.\n\nStill, new forecasts will continue to suggest inflation returning to the ECB's 2 per cent goal next year, keeping the central bank on course for more easing barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The deposit facility rate was lowered from a record high to 3.75 percent and the marginal lending rate was reduced to 4.50 percent.\n\n\"Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady,\" the ECB said.\n\nThe central bank, however, acknowledged that domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\n\nConsequently, the ECB staff raised the headline and core inflation projections for this year and next.\n\nThe ECB staff now sees headline inflation at 2.5 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year and at 1.9 percent in 2026.\n\nCore inflation that excludes energy and food is projected at 2.8 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year and 2.0 percent in 2026.\n\nThe bank also projected Eurozone economic growth at 0.9 percent this year, 1.4 percent next year and 1.6 percent in 2026.\n\n\"The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2 percent medium-term target in a timely manner,\" the bank said.\n\n\"It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.\"\n\nPolicymakers will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, the central bank said.\n\n\"The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path,\" the ECB added.\n\nECB policymakers, including Lagarde, had signaled a June rate cut for months. The latest rate cut marks a rare occasion when the ECB has lowered rates ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to follow suit in September.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, the first rate cut in four years, to become the first G7 country to ease policy in the current cycle that saw central banks adopting aggressive tightening to rein in the runaway inflation in the post-pandemic era.\n\nRecent economic data pointed to sticky inflation in the euro area, mainly in the services sector. Wage growth also remains a concern for policymakers. Economists are of the view that there is little scope for further easing this year.\n\n\"We think that sticky inflation will limit the room for additonal rate cuts and the ECB's statement also doesn't give away any hints at the future path of the ECB,\" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.\n\n\"Any celebrations about today's 25bp rate cut by the ECB are likely to be muted at best, given that the decision was fully discounted by financial markets and the most recent inflation and wage data have dampened expectations for a rapid easing cycle,\" Capital Economics economsit Andrew Kenningham said.\n\n\"Moreover, the Bank's forecasts and statements are slightly hawkish.\"\n\nThe central bank also confirmed that it will reduce the asset holdings under the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) by EUR 7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year.\n\nReinvestments under the PEPP are planned to be discontinued at the end of 2024.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/forextopstory/2024/june/ecb-apr11_06jun24-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Europe's broad stock index pared gains and was last up 0.4% on the day.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nSAMY CHAAR, CHIEF ECONOMIST, LOMBARD ODIER, GENEVA\n\n\"The excitement is to come, the only thing we can say is that they basically have the same 2026 inflation forecast as in March. As they don't see inflation getting back to target until then, this means the ECB probably has 18 months to get back to a neutral rate.\"\n\n\"When they try to communicate about inflation forecasts this is what the game is about. They have initiated a cut, they will go slowly towards neutral, we don't know where that is so we will learn by doing. They will cut and see how the economy reacts, and do that again.\"\n\n\"Where I remain a little bit on high alert is usually communication and action don't go the same way, if you make a dovish action you have hawkish communication. Considering they've cut, very likely (ECB chief Christine) Lagarde will want to point out \"this is not the start of a cycle\", \"we are not on auto pilot\", and so on.\"\n\nARNE PETIMEZAS, SENIOR ANALYST, AFS GROUP, AMSTERDAM\n\n\"The ECB surprised no one by cutting rates by 25bps since the move was well-telegraphed in advance. While the ECB clearly opened the door to further rate cuts, they guide that policy will have to remain restrictive.\"\n\n\"Staff inflation forecasts increased, and the Governing Council sees little or no further improvement in underlying inflation this year. That suggests there's room for two or three rate cuts in the next twelve months or so, with at least one move made next September, when the ECB narrows the interest rate corridor. Unless the US enters a recession and the Fed cuts aggressively, the market has still somewhat overpriced ECB cuts in the next twelve months.\"\n\n\"The ECB was pipped to the post by one day (by the Bank of Canada) to be the first G7 economy to cut interest rates in this economic cycle.\"\n\n\"So far the euro area economy has been fairly 'text book' with inflation shock, rates up, inflation and growth down, so allowing for a fairly straight forward cut in rates. But the labour market is tight and there is no urgency to cut rates back-to-back after this. Moreover, with the Fed and BoE at least a few months away the ECB will be mindful of foreign exchange effects.\"\n\nMARK WALL, CHIEF EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, LONDON:\n\n\"As expected, the ECB cut rates 25bp. But the statement arguably gave less guidance than might have been expected on what comes next. In that sense, the immediate tone is a \"hawkish cut\". This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy.\"\n\nLINDSAY JAMES, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, QUILTER INVESTORS, LONDON:\n\n\"This is a significant move given it is the first rate cut from the ECB in five years, and ends what has been one of the most aggressive and swift rate hiking cycles in modern times.\"\n\n\"Importantly, this is not likely to be a single cut and done for a while, with signals suggesting a further cut or two are on the horizon this year as inflation has subsided.\"\n\n\"While inflation has ticked up in recent months, the economic recovery is beginning to play out. This puts the ECB in a good position to cut further into a slowly improving picture, although the messaging is likely to remain restrained and cautious. As such, there may be some pauses on the way back down for rates in order to limit the scope of any divergence with the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nMARCHEL ALEXANDROVICH, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, SALTMARSH ECONOMICS, LONDON:\n\n\"The ECB moved and followed through on its guidance. They are not committing to further rate cuts and a July move is off the table.\"\n\n\"The focus for markets is whether they will find room to cut in September.\"\n\n\"The ECB revised up their inflation forecasts and I am not surprised. Inflation is proving sticky and that makes it difficult for the ECB to be confident that inflation will come down to target.\"\n\n\"The key comment is that they are not committing to a pre-determined rate path.\"\n\nDEAN TURNER, CHIEF EURO ZONE AND UK ECONOMIST, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, LONDON:\n\n\"Today's widely expected interest rate cut from the ECB will come as a welcome relief to the euro zone economy. The outlook for inflation, as indicated by the ECB's latest projections, point to further interest rate reductions later this year.\"\n\n\"Of course, the timing of the next move from the ECB is uncertain, as this will be dependent upon incoming data. But with the disinflationary process firmly underway, the ECB, along with other central banks, should feel confident enough to ease policy, most likely at a pace of one cut per quarter. Moreover, we should expect this rate-cutting cycle to continue into 2025.\"\n\n(Reporting by the Reuters Markets Team; Compiled by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Amanda Cooper)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacifism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_James_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsay James (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/52a023f/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe8%2Faf5e970b6258155ae0ef5f1584f8c2%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK550IX%3A12024-06-06T123845Z_1_LYNXMPEK550IX_RTROPTP_3_EUROZONE-BANKS-ECB.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Indeed, the ECB raised its 2025 inflation projection to 2.2% on Thursday from 2.0%.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\" the ECB said.\n\nSome economists say the biggest risk to the rate cut schedule is actually the U.S. Federal Reserve, not wages and inflation.\n\nThe Fed has clearly signalled a delay in policy easing and a further delay in U.S. rate cuts is likely to make the ECB more cautious too, as a widening interest rate differential would weaken the euro and raise imported inflation.\n\nAttention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference, where she is likely to be grilled about the ECB's likely next moves.\n\n(Reporting by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Catherine Evans)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

National | Globalnews.ca", "body": "The European Central Bank cut borrowing costs from record highs on Thursday, acknowledging progress in its battle against high inflation but also signaling that fight had yet to be won as inflation was set to remain too high until next year.\n\nInflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen from more than 10 per cent in late 2022 to just above the ECB's two per cent target in recent months, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and a normalization in supply after some post-pandemic snags.\n\nBut that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that euro zone inflation may prove sticky, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThe ECB welcomed the fall in price growth as it trimmed its deposit rate to 3.75 per cent from a record 4.0 per cent, its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut it also raised its inflation forecasts for this year and the next, stressed any further rate reduction would depend on incoming data and reaffirmed that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on prices.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\" the ECB said.\n\nMoney market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after the announcement and only priced in one, with a slight risk of a second, for the remainder of the year.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde is likely to be asked about the pace of further easing and if a rate cut in July might still be on the table at a press conference starting at 1245 GMT.\n\nWith Thursday's move the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, which was stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings earlier this year, is widely expected to join in after the summer.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data about euro zone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fueled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to the ECB's goal - a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nInflation in services, which some policymakers have singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, has been a particular concern after it rebounded to 4.1 per cent in May from 3.7 per cent a month earlier.\n\nMost economists still expect the ECB to continue cutting its policy rate in the coming months and bring it to 2.50% by the end of 2025.\n\nBut they see just two more reductions this year, in September and December.\n\n\"Further cuts in September and December remain our central case,\" HSBC economist Fabio Balboni said in a note. \"But if the recent resilience in services inflation proves sustained, we see increasing chances that the ECB might have to be more cautious on the way down.\"\n\nA rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB by undermining the argument that high rates are choking economic activity.\n\nThe real elephant in the room may be the Fed, however, and whether it starts or further delays its own easing cycle.\n\nA more restrictive Fed would likely mean a weaker euro and higher imported inflation for the currency bloc, but it would also increase yields on global bond markets - a double whammy whose net effect is hard to predict.\n\n\"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year -

The Fed won't follow yet", "body": "London (CNN) -- The European Central Bank cut interest rates Thursday, moving before the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to lower borrowing costs as inflation recedes following years of rate hikes.\n\nThe first ECB rate cut in nearly five years takes the benchmark rate in the 20 countries that use the euro down to 3.75% from an all-time high of 4%, where it had stood since September.\n\nThe move will bring some relief to companies and consumers, many of whom have felt the financial strain of the rapid run-up in interest rates since late 2021.\n\nBut the ECB cautioned that the fight to control price rises wasn't completely over yet, and that it wasn't yet committed to further rate cuts.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\" the central bank said in a statement.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde -- who donned a necklace emblazoned with the words \"In charge\" -- emphasized that the central bank would continue to follow \"a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.\"\n\n\"We are not precommitting to a particular rate path,\" she told journalists.\n\nMajor central banks started raising borrowing costs as inflation soared, driven higher by the end of the pandemic and the energy shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPrice rises in the eurozone, the United States and the United Kingdom have since slowed, bringing the annual inflation rate down from its peak between 9% and 11% towards the 2% targeted by their respective central banks.\n\nThe ECB's decision follows a rate cut by the Bank of Canada Wednesday, which became the first G7 central bank to reduce borrowing costs in the past few years. Central banks in Switzerland and Sweden have also cut interest rates this year.\n\nTraders are all but certain the Fed will keep rates on hold at its meeting next week, and again in July. The Bank of England is likewise not expected to cut rates at its meeting on June 20, which comes just weeks before the United Kingdom holds a general election.\n\nAhead of the Fed, but not in a hurry\n\nAnd although the ECB has fired the starting gun on rate cuts, analysts think it could stand still at its next meeting in July.\n\n\"This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy,\" said Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, describing the ECB's tone as \"hawkish\" despite Thursday's cut.\n\nEurozone inflation ticked up more than expected in May, to 2.6% from 2.4% the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also accelerated as wages grew rapidly.\n\nOn Thursday, the ECB raised its inflation forecast for this year, to 2.5% from the 2.3% predicted in March. It added that it would keep interest rates \"sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to return inflation to the 2% target.\n\nThe European economy, which only narrowly avoided a recession last year, is showing signs of recovery, which could prop up inflation.\n\nIn May, combined output in manufacturing and services hit a 12-month high, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank. Business confidence, meanwhile, reached its strongest level in more than two years and unemployment is at a record low.\n\nThe ECB upgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from the 0.6% projected in March.\n\nAnother factor that could influence the central bank's thinking is the timing of rate cuts by the Fed, expected later this year. Policymakers in Frankfurt may be hesitant to move too far ahead of the Fed as that could cause the euro to lose value against the dollar, which could then push up inflation in Europe by raising the price of imports.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to attract more international capital flows into a country, lifting demand for its currency.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But future cuts may be limited. - Medicine Hat News", "body": "SUBSCRIBE NOW FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter point, moving ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve as central banks around the world lean toward lowering borrowing costs - a shift with far-reaching consequences for home buyers, savers and investors. The ECB cut its benchmark rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4% at a meeting of the bank's 26-member rate-setting council in Frankfurt. The ECB said in a statement that \"price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\"\u009d allowing it to start loosening credit. The question now is how far and how fast the ECB, Federal Reserve and other central bankers will go in lower their benchmarks, with inflation subsiding but not yet back to levels considered best for the economy. Analysts say the quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. While inflation at an annual rate of 2.6% in May is well down from peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months and inflation even ticked up slighly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1% THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The European Central Bank plans to move ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday in cutting interest rates, making the eurozone the biggest rich-world economy to start easing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers as the inflation that arose after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine slowly recedes. ECB President Christine Lagarde and other officials have made it clear that a quarter-point rate cut from the current record high of 4% is more than likely when the bank's 26-member governing council meets at the institution's skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. Lagarde said late last month that she was \"really confident\"\u009d inflation was under control in the eurozone, the 20 European Union countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB sets monetary policy. Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday. Such a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later. Major central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation. The inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%. The Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year. Widening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive. But the euro has actually strengthened recently - from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 - even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks. Rate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently. Growth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before. \"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\"\u009d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. \"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\"\u009d Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\u009d Analysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1% Central bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks. In Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press",

The bank trimmed its deposit rate to 3.75% and raised inflation forecasts, stressing any further rate cuts depend on new data. This complex scenario resembles similar challenges faced by central banks worldwide.\n\nThe European Central Bank cut borrowing costs from record highs on Thursday, acknowledging progress in its battle against high inflation but also signalling that fight had yet to be won as inflation was set to remain too high until next year. Inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above the ECB's 2% target in recent months, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and a normalisation in supply after some post-pandemic snags.\n\nBut that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that euro zone inflation may prove sticky, as has been the case in the United States. The ECB welcomed the fall in price growth as it trimmed its deposit rate to 3.75% from a record 4.0%, its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut it also raised its inflation forecasts for this year and the next, stressed any further rate reduction would depend on incoming data and reaffirmed that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on prices. \"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\" the ECB said.\n\nMoney market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after the announcement and only priced in one, with a slight risk of a second, for the remainder of the year. ECB President Christine Lagarde is likely to be asked about the pace of further easing and if a rate cut in July might still be on the table at a press conference starting at 1245 GMT.\n\nWith Thursday's move the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which was stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings earlier this year, is widely expected to join in after the summer.\n\nLAST MILE But some stronger-than-expected data about euro zone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to the ECB's goal - a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nInflation in services, which some policymakers have singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, has been a particular concern after it rebounded to 4.1% in May from 3.7% a month earlier. Most economists still expect the ECB to continue cutting its policy rate in the coming months and bring it to 2.50% by the end of 2025.\n\nBut they see just two more reductions this year, in September and December. \"Further cuts in September and December remain our central case,\" HSBC economist Fabio Balboni said in a note. \"But if the recent resilience in services inflation proves sustained, we see increasing chances that the ECB might have to be more cautious on the way down.\"\n\nA rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB by undermining the argument that high rates are choking economic activity. The real elephant in the room may be the Fed, however, and whether it starts or further delays its own easing cycle.\n\nA more restrictive Fed would likely mean a weaker euro and higher imported inflation for the currency bloc, but it would also increase yields on global bond markets - a double whammy whose net effect is hard to predict. \"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\" (Editing by Toby Chopra, Sonali Paul and Catherine Evans)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Schnabel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabel Schnabel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HSBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_02_04_26_4599114.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Policymakers are cautious, stressing that further reductions depend on incoming data. The decision aligns with moves by other central banks but faces criticism from some economists.\n\nThe European Central Bank was all but certain to cut interest rates from record highs on Thursday and was likely to acknowledge it had made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight was not yet over.\n\nECB policymakers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months. The broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve. But what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appeared more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis meant that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues were unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet. Instead, they were expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"The cut will set the new direction for policy but with economic momentum outperforming expectations and domestic inflation proving sticky in 2024, the ECB can afford to take things slowly and let the data set the parameters of the easing cycle,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a note to clients. All 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% on Thursday from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut not all think it is a good idea. Gabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\".\n\n\"The cost of waiting until September appears low while the benefit of getting more clarity on the inflation outlook appears high,\" Fuzesi added. \"For some reason, the ECB Governing Council, however, seems already to have decided many weeks ago to deliver a June cut.\" NO DECLARATION OF VICTORY\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand. Most economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year and money markets priced in between one and two more moves, possibly in September and December.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2% inflation than the ECB has been predicting -- a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel. Euro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policymakers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1% from 3.7%, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nThis was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes. \"We're still confident about services inflation coming down but there's definitely a last-mile dynamic at play here,\" Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at BNP-Paribas, said.\n\nEconomic activity surveys have also pointed to a stronger-than-expected rebound by the economy after more than a year of stagnation, which is likely to force the ECB to increase its GDP forecast for this year when it publishes its new projections on Thursday. These were still expected to point to inflation returning to the ECB's 2% goal next year, keeping the central bank on course for more easing barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\" (Editing by Toby Chopra)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Schnabel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabel Schnabel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BNP Paribas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_22_02_21_8610345.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

had made progress in its battle against high inflation, while also stressing the fight was not yet over.\n\nECB policymakers have clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appeared more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis meant that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues were unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they were expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"The cut will set the new direction for policy but with economic momentum outperforming expectations and domestic inflation proving sticky in 2024, the ECB can afford to take things slowly and let the data set the parameters of the easing cycle,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAll 82 economists polled by Reuters expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% on Thursday from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nBut not all think it is a good idea.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\" and JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said it was \"oddly rushed\".\n\n\"The cost of waiting until September appears low while the benefit of getting more clarity on the inflation outlook appears high,\" Fuzesi added. \"For some reason, the ECB Governing Council, however, seems already to have decided many weeks ago to deliver a June cut.\"\n\nNO DECLARATION OF VICTORY\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane set the tone last week, saying that a rate cut would be no \"declaration of victory\" and the pace of further reductions would depend on progress on domestic inflation and demand.\n\nMost economists still expected two further rate cuts by the end of the year and money markets priced in between one and two more moves, possibly in September and December.\n\nBut some stronger-than-expected data over the last few weeks fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to 2% inflation than the ECB has been predicting -- a concern often expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nEuro zone inflation rose more than predicted in May, with price growth in the services sector, which some policymakers singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, rebounding to 4.1% from 3.7%, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nThis was likely to mirror larger-than-expected increases in wages in the first quarter of the year, which boosted consumers' battered disposable income after years of below-inflation pay hikes.\n\n\"We're still confident about services inflation coming down but there's definitely a last-mile dynamic at play here,\" Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at BNP-Paribas, said.\n\nEconomic activity surveys have also pointed to a stronger-than-expected rebound by the economy after more than a year of stagnation, which is likely to force the ECB to increase its GDP forecast for this year when it publishes its new projections on Thursday.\n\nThese were still expected to point to inflation returning to the ECB's 2% goal next year, keeping the central bank on course for more easing barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nEditing by Toby Chopra", "source": {"uri":

EUR/USD is trading at 1.0879 in the European session, up 0.10% on the day.\n\nBarring a huge surprise, the European Central Bank will cut its deposit rate later today. The ECB has maintained the deposit rate at 4.0% for five straight months as policymakers have been content to maintain a \"higher for longer\" stance after a steep rate-tightening cycle.\n\nAre conditions ripe for a rate cut? ECB officials think so as they can point to an inflation rate which has fallen from double-digits to below 3%. The ECB is confident that inflation will not rebound after a rate cut. However, that doesn't mean that the titanic battle against inflation is over. Far from it - the 2% inflation target has proven elusive and perhaps more worrying, eurozone inflation accelerated in May. The headline figure rose from 2.4% to 2.6% while the core rate climbed from 2.7% to 2.9%.\n\nThe ECB couldn't have been pleased with these inflation numbers but remains confident that inflation will continue to move lower. The eurozone economy has been sluggish and a rate cut should provide a boost to the economy and provide relief for consumers who are groaning under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nThe ECB has been careful not to commit to additional rate cuts and there's a strong possibility that the central bank will wait until late in the year to see the effects of the rate cut before lowering rates for a second time. ECB policymakers will also be keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve, which won't be cutting before September at the earliest. The Fed usually takes the lead on rate policy and the ECB will be hesitant to cut twice ahead of the Fed, as this could weaken the euro and send inflation higher.\n\nThe US releases nonfarm payrolls on Friday and the report is expected to show that the US labor market is slowly cooling off.

The central bank had held rates at their peak for nine months before making the move.\n\nHowever, the movement in central bank peers from Group of Seven (G7) countries isn't likely to sway the Federal Reserve to follow the example.\n\nThe ECB said it was ready to cut rates because of the progress made on inflation since the central bank moved rates higher last September. However, prices grew by 2.6% annually in May, above target, and Eurosystem staff increased their inflation projections for both 2024 and 2025.\n\n\"Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"At the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\"\n\nThat inflation is similar to levels in the U.S. According to the most recent Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, inflation rose 2.7% over the year in April. Both central banks are attempting to get inflation to a goal of 2%.\n\nThe difference between the trajectory of these economies is the path of inflation so far this year.

This move also aligns with earlier monetary policy easing by central banks in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Switzerland, and Sweden this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the ECB has gained a head start over the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, both of which are likely still months away from making similar cuts.\n\n\"Price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" she said, adding that the ECB intends to keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve its targeted level of inflation. \"We are not committing to a particular rate path,\" Ms. Lagarde said.\n\nThe ECB president also noted that inflation had decreased sufficiently to allow the central bank to begin lowering rates. However, with eurozone inflation expected to stay above the ECB's 2 percent target into the next year, she refrained from specifying the speed or magnitude of future rate cuts.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\" the ECB president said.\n\nThe ECB revised its forecasts for headline and core inflation in 2024 and 2025 upward from March projections. The central bank now expects headline inflation to average 2.5 percent in 2024, 2.2 percent in 2025, and 1.9 percent in 2026.\n\nHigher U.S. interest rates would tighten global and local financial markets, even though a widening interest rate differential between the two regions may theoretically cause the euro to lose value versus the dollar, making European exports more competitive for the foreign market.\n\nAside from that, a falling euro would cause the spread between government bond yields to grow, causing bond prices to rise faster in the eurozone than in the United States. This is attributed to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields.\n\nOn the other hand, government stimulus, pandemic recovery spending, and stronger growth are driving inflation in a different economy that the Fed is dealing with.\n\nWith an annual rate of 3.4 percent, the U.S. Consumer Price Index is well off the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, market indicators suggest that the Fed's decision may proceed on its own schedule. The euro saw an uptick, with the euro/U.S. dollar pair climbing to 1.0880. Sovereign bond yields in the eurozone also rose, although European equities pared back some of their earlier gains, even as the Euro Stoxx 600 index hit record highs earlier in the day.\n\nIn other

Central banks in Switzerland and Sweden have also cut interest rates this year.\n\nAhead of the Fed, but not in a hurry\n\nAnalysts doubt the central bank will cut rates again at its next meeting in July.\n\n\"This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy,\" said Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, describing the ECB's tone as \"hawkish\" despite Thursday's cut.\n\nEurozone inflation ticked up more than expected in May, to 2.6% from 2.4% the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also accelerated as wages grew rapidly.\n\nOn Thursday, the ECB raised its inflation forecast for this year, to 2.5% from the 2.3% predicted in March. It added that it would keep interest rates \"sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to return inflation to the 2% target.\n\nThe European economy, which only narrowly avoided a recession last year, is showing signs of recovery, which could prop up inflation.\n\nIn May, combined output in manufacturing and services hit a 12-month high, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank. Business confidence, meanwhile, reached its strongest level in more than two years and unemployment is at a record low.\n\nThe ECB upgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from the 0.6% projected in March.\n\nAnother factor that could influence the central bank's thinking is the timing of rate cuts by the Fed, expected later this year. Policymakers in Frankfurt may be hesitant to move too far ahead of the Fed as that could cause the euro to lose value against the dollar, which could then push up inflation in Europe by raising the price of imports.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to attract more international capital flows into a country, lifting demand for its currency.\n\nTraders are all but certain the Fed will keep rates on hold at its meeting next week. The Bank of England is likewise not expected to cut rates at its meeting on June 20, which comes just weeks before the United Kingdom holds a general election.\n\nThis article has been updated with

Analysts' forecasts By Investing.com", "body": "Investing.com - Despite a slight rise in inflation in May, there should be no surprises at the ECB meeting on June 6: everything is set in Frankfurt for the first rate cut since September 2019. But then what? Will the decline be steep, or will rates remain high for a long time? There are many uncertainties about what lies ahead. To shed some light, let's discover what analysts expect from the upcoming European Central Bank meeting.\n\nAnnalisa Piazza, Fixed Income Research Analyst at MFS IM\n\nThe ECB is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at this week's meeting. This cut has been widely anticipated since the April Governing Council meeting, although the ECB has consistently emphasized that decisions depend on data.\n\nA June cut is widely discounted, but the outlook for the second half of the year is less clear, with less than a 100% probability that the ECB will cut by another 50 basis points (which is our base scenario). We do not expect the ECB to provide strong forward guidance during this week's meeting, but the new updated projections will determine whether the recent data volatility has led to a significant change in the ECB's policy outlook.\n\nWe expect the ECB, after examining the recent data volatility and updated projections, to confirm that inflation will return to 2% by mid-2025. Regarding growth, we struggle to see how GDP can be revised above potential levels in the short term, as the first quarter's positive surprise is unlikely to repeat, given that the recent surge in energy prices could pose a minor drag on real disposable income in the short term and an obstacle to a robust investment recovery. We suspect that the GDP outlook for 2024 will remain relatively sluggish, with a recovery expected only in 2025 towards the baseline value.\n\nJune's ECB projections will be closely watched. If the short-term inflation profile does not change substantially (despite rising negotiated wages), this would imply that the ECB is confident that the disinflation process is underway and that further cuts can be made in the second half of the year. With inflation falling to around 2% by 2025, it will be difficult to justify such restrictive policy rates. The ECB will need to be cautious in its communication to avoid speculation about policy rates moving into expansionary territory too soon. Currently, the risk is very low, as markets expect terminal rates above 2.5% within three years.\n\nWe expect Lagarde to confirm that the ECB is not influenced by the Fed and remains data-dependent. The possibility of a July cut will not be completely ruled out (as recently suggested by Villeroy), but there will be no announcements on this aspect.\n\nTomasz Wieladek, Chief European Economist at T. Rowe Price\n\nThis week, the ECB will cut the benchmark rate. This outcome has long been indicated by ECB policymakers, including some of the more hawkish members of the Governing Council. Recent data could have cast doubt on this development, but the forward guidance provided by the ECB is too strong to deviate from now.\n\nRecent data has exceeded the ECB's and markets' expectations regarding inflationary pressures. Negotiated wage growth rose to 4.7% in the first quarter of 2024 from 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, against expectations of a decline. In the latest European Commission survey, the percentage of firms citing labor shortages as a production constraint has increased again. This data strongly predicts negotiated wage growth, the ECB's key wage indicator. Similarly, Eurozone HICP inflation in May was significantly stronger than expected, while services inflation rose from 3.7% in April to 4.1% in May. This is not just a base effect: seasonally adjusted and on a daily basis, services inflation rose by 0.5% in May. This is about double the rate required by the ECB to reach its target. Surveys suggest services inflation will eventually decrease, but this has yet to be seen in the actual inflation data. Finally, shipping costs from China are again rising rapidly, likely pushing up core goods inflation as well. Gas prices have also started to rise again. After a long period of disinflation, inflationary pressures across components are rising.\n\nThese inflation developments cast doubt on future cuts. Based on forward-looking wage and inflation indicators, I expect further disinflation in the second half of 2024. This would allow the ECB to make a total of three cuts this year. However, the risk that the ECB will cut rates only twice this year is increasing.\n\nShaan Raithatha, Senior Investment Strategist at Vanguard\n\nThe beginning of the ECB's easing cycle at Thursday's meeting has been widely anticipated by the Governing Council in recent weeks. A 25 basis points cut is expected for all three main policy rates: the deposit rate, the marginal lending rate, and the main refinancing rate. At the time of writing, markets have fully priced in this outcome.\n\nThe pace of subsequent easing, however, is more uncertain. May's CPI surprised to the upside, driven by services, while prices for food, energy, and essentials remained stable. Even though we are still awaiting the exact data, it seems unlikely that base effects related to the Easter period and the introduction of the low-cost public transport ticket in Germany last year can explain the entire upside surprise. The increase in core services inflation, combined with wage and GDP growth in the first quarter, increases the risk that the ECB will cut rates at a slower pace than the currently expected quarterly cadence.\n\nThat said, we maintain our forecast of successive quarterly cuts for three reasons. First, high-frequency indicators suggest significant wage growth deceleration in the coming months. This is evidenced by the ECB's and Indeed's wage trackers and is an opinion shared by key Governing Council members, including Philip Lane (see his recent interview with the FT). This, along with recent signs of price moderation in European Commission surveys and PMI indexes, suggests that services inflation should soon start to decline. Second, given the considerable decline in inflation in recent months, the ECB can justify a lower nominal policy rate while maintaining the same level of real restrictive measures. Third, even the so-called hawks on the committee signal the expectation of multiple rate cuts this year. For example, Dutch Governor Klaas Knot has indicated that three or four cuts in 2024 would be consistent with the optimal policy based on the March projections, while Austrian Governor Holzmann has supported a rate cut on Thursday and expects a total of two or three cuts by December.\n\nIf this forecast is confirmed, our (and the ECB's) assessment is that quarterly 25 basis points cuts would bring the central bank deposit rate to the neutral level (2-2.5%) by the end of 2025.\n\nPatrick Barbe, Head of European Investment Grade Fixed Income at Neuberger Berman\n\nMay saw the first rebound in core inflation since March 2023, but only a return to levels from two months ago. The reason for this 0.2% increase is mainly due to temporary factors in the services sector, such as all-inclusive vacation packages in Germany and the end of discounts on service prices (VAT on electricity, train tickets,...), so this does not challenge the continuation of the inflation decline and hence the medium-to-long-term forecasts made by the ECB. Moreover, we must remember that out-of-control inflation led the ECB to raise the reference rate to 4% last year. Today, the question remains how long it will take for inflation to return to 2%, meaning a reference rate of 4% is somewhat too restrictive by Eurozone standards, increasing the likelihood of a first cut on Thursday.\n\nWe can expect a return to the downward trend in core inflation after May's rebound. However, as the ECB has repeatedly explained, wage growth is the most relevant criterion for its future rate policy. First-quarter data saw a further increase of +4.7% year-on-year, well above the 3% threshold, driven mainly by Germany. This is clearly a problem, but new leading indicators point to lower negotiated wage increases, meaning the ECB can start cutting its reference rates but should remain cautiously data-dependent. We therefore expect the ECB to maintain its hawkish policy this year, but to a lesser extent, with the reference rate reduced to 3%. We foresee an outperformance of Euro bonds, with a 10-year Bund yield below 2.25%. While we expect the ECB to highlight uncertainties for the coming months, we await an updated analysis and its forecasts on national wage increases and their impact on the inflation rate.\n\nGilles Mo\u00ebc, AXA Group Chief Economist and Head of AXA IM Research\n\nIt is very likely that the ECB will announce a rate cut on Thursday, even though recent data has not been helpful. In our view, central banks should wait for all indicators to align before changing course only in very specific cases: when long-term inflation expectations are unanchored, when monetary policy transmission is compromised, when monetary policy is countered by fiscal policy, and finally, when there are significant indications that the neutral rate has shifted higher. We believe that none of these conditions currently apply to the Eurozone.\n\nGiven the confidence that monetary policy is restrictive and will remain so even after a first 25 basis points cut, we believe the ECB could easily risk outlining its trajectory for the rest of 2024. However, we do not believe it will do so. We expect few indications from Thursday's meeting, especially as opinions within the Governing Council remain too far apart to build a consensus at this stage. We expect the ECB to proceed with rate cuts in September and December. Such a pace would be justified by some pockets of resistance to disinflation in the services sector and the risk that corporate margin behavior will slow convergence towards the ECB's target.\n\nSuch \"margin resilience\" could, however, materialize only if decent cyclical conditions prevail. Business confidence indicators have been more favorable for the Euro area recently, but we believe that the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside and that the Governing Council should be ready to remove restrictions more quickly. Data dependency should go both ways.\n\nConversely, in the United States, conditions are in place to wait for an almost perfect alignment of indicators, which makes the Fed's reluctance to discuss a timeline for a policy shift perfectly understandable. However, we believe that the data flow is beginning to align, such as with further signs of weakening consumer spending. In this regard, this week's labor market data will obviously be crucial, pending the data on new jobs and wages.\n\nFranck Dixmier, Global CIO Fixed Income at Allianz Global Investors\n\nPresident Christine Lagarde and the more dovish members of the Governing Council have strongly suggested the imminent cut, which has therefore been fully anticipated by the markets.\n\nInvestors' focus will turn to what comes next. The start of a rate-cutting cycle, after a long phase of steady rates, will raise questions about the next moves. What is the target for the final rate? And how quickly will the ECB reach it? Investors will pay close attention to any hints in response to these questions, as well as to the macroeconomic forecasts expected to be presented.\n\nWhile there is consensus on this first rate cut, the pace of future cuts is already the subject of lively debate within the Council. Inflation expectations are anchored at levels close to the ECB's target (the 5-year inflation swap was 2.3%), providing a good indication of investors' confidence in the central bank's ability to meet its mandate. The Council's focus will be more on the exact trajectory of inflation towards the central bank's price stability target and its confidence level that inflation will remain at that level.\n\nAfter peaking at +10.6% year-on-year in October 2022, the consumer price index in the Euro area stood at +2.6% in May 2024. The same downward trend is seen in core inflation: after peaking at +5.7% in March 2023, it fell to +2.9% last May. Although the decline in inflation recently has been notable, the ECB should continue to remain vigilant about potential second-round effects following wage increases (negotiated wages rose by +4.7% in the Euro area in the first quarter), as well as the trends in other costs, such as shipping, which has been impacted by the crisis in the Red Sea.\n\nFuture inflation data is likely to be volatile and the ECB might reiterate its gradual approach to rate cuts.\n\nLowie Debou, Fixed Income Manager, DPAM\n\nThe economic data, expectations, and communications received suggest that a 25-basis point cut by the European Central Bank is a certainty. However, we do not believe this will be sufficient to revive the fortunes of the continental economy. Such a modest cut would still keep monetary policy decidedly restrictive. At best, even a return to the pre-Covid neutral rate would require a greater cut. Even then, it is uncertain that we would witness a European growth trend similar to that of the United States, as this would require a rate policy well below neutrality.\n\nIt is very reasonable for the ECB to begin a full cycle of cuts before the Fed. In recent months, the likelihood that Frankfurt will manage to ensure a soft landing has increased significantly. Consequently, maintaining a too restrictive rate for too long increases the likelihood of a recessionary drift. If the ECB were to start cutting rates now, it could act more conservatively compared to previous cycles, maintaining the narrative of a soft landing. As a result, we would finally find ourselves again in a context where the ECB, if necessary, would have room to cut interest rates more aggressively, reducing the need for unconventional monetary policy. This would be an even better scenario for European fixed income investors, as yields would remain higher and carry-related returns would remain a reliable source of expected gains.\n\nAzad Zangana, Senior European Economist & Strategist, Schroders\n\nAs for the European Central Bank, our estimates foresee the first cut occurring during the June meeting, followed by three more 25-basis point cuts by the end of the year.\n\nWe expect the ECB to make another two 25-basis point cuts in the first quarter of next year, then remain on hold for the rest of 2025. The pause will likely be forced by the reemergence of inflationary pressures. With the resumption of domestic demand and the return of growth above the trend, the lack of unused productive capacity, particularly in labor markets, should drive up wage inflation, forcing companies to raise the prices of their products. Although the Eurozone is emerging from a cyclical contraction phase, unemployment rates have remained close to decade lows, highlighting the impact of demographic aging and labor hoarding.\n\nDISCOUNT CODE Take advantage of the\u26a0\ufe0f JUNE DISCOUNT \u26a0\ufe0fClick here for in-depth analysis of over 180,000 listed companies worldwide, start investing like a PRO!\n\nThe link calculates and applies the additional 10% discount directly.

Central banks in Switzerland and Sweden have also cut interest rates this year.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference later Thursday.\n\nAnalysts doubt the central bank will cut rates again at its next meeting in July. Eurozone inflation ticked up more than expected in May, to 2.6% from 2.4% the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also accelerated as wages grew rapidly.\n\nOn Thursday, the ECB raised its inflation forecast for this year, to 2.5% from the 2.3% predicted in March. It added that it would keep interest rates \"sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to return inflation to the 2% target.\n\nThe European economy, which only narrowly avoided a recession last year, is also showing signs of recovery, which could cause inflation to rise again.\n\nIn May, combined output in manufacturing and services hit a 12-month high, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank. Business confidence, meanwhile, reached its strongest level in more than two years.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said the data \"indicates... that the eurozone's economy is gathering further strength.\"\n\nThe ECB upgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from the 0.6% projected in March.\n\nAnother factor that could influence the central bank's thinking is the timing of rate cuts by the Fed, expected later this year. Policymakers in Frankfurt may be hesitant to move too far ahead of the Fed as that could cause the euro to lose value against the dollar, which could then push up inflation in Europe by raising the price of imports.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to attract more international capital flows into a country, lifting demand for its currency.\n\nTraders are all but certain the Fed will keep rates on hold at its meeting next week. The Bank of England is likewise not expected to cut rates at its meeting on June 20, which comes just weeks before the United Kingdom holds a general election.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Commercial_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg Commercial Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/01/ecb-2024-01-43697ae4a9a3415ab418be7157616529-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 3270, "textEnd": 3277}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) said on Thursday it was \"appropriate\" to trim its main deposit rate from 4% to 3.75%.\n\nIt followed an assertion last month by its president, Christine Lagarde, that the pace of price increases was now \"under control\".\n\nBut the Bank declared in a statement that the battle was not won - signalling data-driven caution on future policy decisions in the months ahead.\n\nIts staff even revised upwards their forecasts for inflation this year and next.\n\n\"The governing council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction\", the ECB said, adding: \"The governing council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nMoney latest:\n\nNew Jaffa Cake flavour may divide people\n\nThe ECB first moved to deal with surging inflation in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine that saw its main measure surge above 10% as energy and other key commodity costs rose sharply across Western economies.\n\nThe Bank's decision to cut - ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - was widely anticipated due to the guidance it had given and confidence the president had already expressed in the likely path for inflation ahead.\n\nBut some economists and financial market commentators believe the ECB has jumped the gun.\n\nThe eurozone's last reading for inflation, in May, rose from 2.4% to 2.6% and there is a mixed picture for price stability across the bloc with the highest readings coming from those member states in the east.\n\nThe Bank's new projections saw inflation averaging 2.4% this year and 2.2% in 2025.\n\nIt is services inflation that is proving stubborn to come down - in both the euro area and UK - the latter of which last showed an inflation reading of 2.3%.\n\nFor that reason, the Bank of England is not expected to begin cutting UK borrowing costs until August at least.\n\nGabriele Fo\u00e0, a portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said the ECB cut \"may soon be viewed as a policy mistake\".\n\nJPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi described the move as \"oddly rushed\" while another economist, Lorenzo Codogno at LC Macro Advisors, said: \"If economic data did not support a rate cut back in March, they do even less today.\n\nRead more:\n\nEuro zone rate cut has benefits and risks

strengthened.\"\n\nThe risk for the ECB is that it imports additional inflation from a weaker euro.\n\nInterest rate cuts are traditionally not supportive of a domestic currency, making goods and services bought in denominations such as dollars and pounds more expensive.\n\nThese additional costs can be passed on down the supply chain, ultimately putting upwards pressure on inflation.\n\nThe ECB's rate cut was largely priced in on the currency markets beforehand but its caution on the path ahead limited movements with the euro rising slightly against both the dollar and pound.\n\nThere was also some additional comfort for investors in that the ECB was not acting alone.\n\nIt joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates.\n\nThe ECB does not expect to hit its target rate for inflation until \"well into\" next year.\n\nHolger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, expected more easing ahead barring new inflation surprises.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the euro zone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that\n\nthe ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes.\n\n\"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates

In new forecasts released with the widely flagged rate cut, the ECB said it expected inflation to average 2.2 per cent in 2025 - up from a previous estimate of 2.0 per cent and meaning it was now seen holding above the central bank's 2 per cent target well into next year.\n\nInflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen to 2.6 per cent from more than 10 per cent in late 2022, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and an easing of post-pandemic supply snags. But that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that inflation may prove sticky, as has been the case in the United States. Cutting its deposit rate to 3.75 per cent from a record-high 4.0 per cent, the ECB gave no indication as to whether that would be followed by a further easing in July.\n\n\"We are not pre-comitting to a particular rate path,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde told a press conference, reading from the Governing Council's statement. \"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\"\n\nWith Thursday's move the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history. Some ECB-watchers have questioned the logic of moving now, however, especially as the US Federal Reserve has been stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings and is not expected to move till after the summer.\n\nMoney market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after Thursday's announcement and only priced in one more, with a slight risk of a second, for the remainder of the year. Asked if the ECB was moving into a phase of \"dialling back\" its tight monetary policy stance, Lagarde said she could not confirm such a process was underway, but that there was \"a strong likelihood\". \"But it will be data-dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she added.\n\nStronger-than-expected data about euro zone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to the ECB's goal - a concern expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel. Inflation in services, which some policymakers have singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, has been a particular concern after a rise to 4.1 per cent in May from 3.7 per cent a month earlier.\n\nAt the same time, a rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB by undermining the argument that high rates are choking economic activity. But the real elephant in the room may remain the Fed and whether it starts or further delays its own easing cycle.\n\nA more restrictive Fed would likely mean a weaker euro and higher imported inflation for the currency bloc, but it would also increase yields on global bond markets - a double whammy whose net effect is hard to predict. \"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@news9live.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ECB-slashes-rate-for-first-time-in-5-years.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Similarly, the Bank of England will want to avoid similar issues for sterling in the months ahead.\n\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon said: 'Central banks are mindful that with stubborn core inflation in the US, partly fuelled by firmer demand conditions than prevalent across the rest of the developed world, the exchange rate impact on imported inflation through a deterioration in US Dollar terms of trade is a material risk factor.\n\n'It is notable that the Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar [where rate cuts have started] have weakened more materially than the UK pound and euro since the start of the year.\n\n'However, it should also be noted that both the krona and franc are now up on their USD value compared tothe day of the interest rate cut. This recovery will not go unnoticed in Frankfurt and London as they consider their own policy steps.'\n\nMarket pricing suggests the ECB will cut rates twice more before year-end, bringing the its key rate to 3.25 per cent.\n\nWhat could the election mean for your money?\n\nThe Prime Minister put an end to all the speculation by giving us the date for the general election: July 4.\n\nSimon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Lee Boyce delve into the economic state of affairs and what the upcoming election could mean for your money.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nPress play to listen to the episode on the player above, or listen (and please subscribe and review us if you like the podcast) at\n\nApple Podcasts, Audioboom and Spotify or visit our This is Money Podcast page.\n\nWhen will the BoE cut?\n\nExpectations for the timing of the first Bank of England interest rate cut have swung wildly this year, as fresh economic data has continued to upend market opinion.\n\nNot long ago, market pricing suggested the BoE would join the ECB in a June rate cut, but it is now thought the UK's central bank will cite still-high core inflation and the looming general election as reasons to hold off until August.\n\nRead More June base rate cut now unlikely after inflation exceeds expectations: What does it mean for YOUR mortgage?\n\nUK consumer prices index inflation rose by more than expected at 2.3 per cent in the 12 months to April, but down from 3.2 per cent the previous month, as core CPI proved to be frustratingly sticky at 3.9 per cent.\n\nBut construction industry data published on Thursday could offer some optimism to the Monetary Policy Committee when it meets on 20 June.\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said: 'The key news for the MPC was that the input prices index of the construction PMI dropped to 50.4, well below its five-year average of 66.2.\n\n'The takeaway from this is that April's sticky inflation numbers were probably a direct response to the increase in the minimum wage, rather than a reflection of underlying price pressures. Price pressures are now easing across the economy.'\n\nMarket pricing suggests the BoE may only pull off two rate cuts at 25bps each this year, bringing base rate from its current level of 5.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent.\n\nAnalysts at UBS, however, are more optimistic and expect 75bps of BoE cuts this year - bringing base rate to 4.5 per cent by the end of 2024 - followed by 175bps in 2025.\n\nUBS said: 'However, in light of disappointing inflation data, we acknowledge the risk of a later cut, in August.\n\n'The markets currently price in 1bp of cuts by June, 9.5bps by August with the first rate priced in only by November.'\n\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMS Easy investing Stocks & shares Isa \u00a31.50 fund dealing 0.25% fee on fund holdings Investment ideas Free fund dealing Free fund dealing 0.45% account fee capped for shares Flat-fee investing No fees From \u00a34.99 a month Trade shares and funds for \u00a33.99 Social investing Social investing Share investing 30+ million global community No account fee Investment account Free share dealing Free fractional share* Affiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

However, we suspect ECB policymakers would prefer to see a return to an overall downward trend in wage growth and domestic inflation to be fully comfortable in lowering interest rates further, and thus view the risks as tilted toward lesser easing.\n\nEuropean Central Bank Kicks Off Its Rate Cut Cycle\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) today joined the growing group of advanced economy central banks (including the Swiss National Bank, Riksbank and Bank of Canada) that have begun their respective monetary policy easing cycles. The ECB lowered its benchmark interest rates by 25 bps, bringing its Deposit Rate to 3.75%, and offered several perspectives in support of its decision to ease monetary policy, saying:\n\nWhile clearly acknowledging the improving inflation situation, the ECB's announcement was balanced by some cautious and hawkish elements, saying domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and that inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. Indeed, near-term core inflation projections (CPI excluding food and energy) have been revised higher to 2.8% for 2024 (previously 2.6%) and to 2.2% for 2025 (previously 2.1%). The core inflation forecast for 2026 was unchanged at 2.0%. The ECB also raised its GDP growth forecast for 2024 to 0.9%, from 0.6% previously.\n\nIn terms of policy guidance, we view the ECB's statement as consistent with further rate cuts, albeit at a measured pace. The ECB said it will \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve\" a timely return to the 2% inflation target. Use of \"sufficiently\" restrictive does, in our view, allow for some further reduction in interest rates given their currently elevated levels. The ECB added however that it \"will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.\" Finally, the ECB said it is not committing to a particular rate path.\n\nToday's interest rate reduction was clearly signaled ahead of time by ECB policymakers and widely forecast, including by ourselves. Going forward, we have also forecast the ECB will hold rates steady in July before delivering another 25 bps rate cut in September. By the fourth quarter we expect Eurozone wage growth and underlying inflation may have slowed sufficiently for the ECB to deliver rate cuts at its October and December meetings, especially if the Federal Reserve begins lowering interest rates as well. If realized, that would see the Deposit rate lowered by a cumulative 100 bps this year to end 2024 at 3.00%.\n\nWe view today's announcement as very much consistent with the ECB keeping interest rates unchanged at its July meeting, while the optionality embodied in today's statement would allow for a resumption of rate cuts in September. That said, we view the risks around our ECB easing outlook for this year as tilted toward a lesser 75 bps of rate cuts, compared to our base case for a cumulative 100 bps of rate reduction. ECB policymakers are likely wary of the modest uptick in Eurozone wage growth reported for Q1, and the uptick of core inflation and particularly services inflation in May. Over the next few months ahead of the ECB's 12 September monetary policy announcement we will get CPI inflation data for June, July and August, and both the Q2 Indicator of Negotiated Wages along with Q2 compensation per employee (the most comprehensive wage measure) will be available in time for the September meeting. We suspect ECB policymakers would prefer to see a return to an overall downward trend in wage growth and domestic inflation to be fully comfortable in lowering interest rates further. Against that backdrop, a further interruption to the disinflation progress could put one of our expected September or October rate cuts at risk.", "source": {"uri": "actionforex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Action Forex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wells_fargo_securities@actionforex.com", "name": "Wells Fargo Securities", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_Riksbank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sveriges Riksbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiss National Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/f-ecb-51.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-12", "textStart": 3364, "textEnd": 3376}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

up from a previous estimate of 2.0 per cent and meaning it was now seen holding above the central bank's 2 per cent target well into next year.\n\nInflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen to 2.6 per cent from more than 10 per cent in late 2022, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and an easing of post-pandemic supply snags.\n\nBut that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that inflation may prove sticky, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nCutting its deposit rate to 3.75 per cent from a record-high 4.0 per cent, the ECB gave no indication as to whether that would be followed by a further easing in July.\n\n\"We are not pre-comitting to a particular rate path,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde told a press conference, reading from the Governing Council's statement.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\"\n\nWith Thursday's move, the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history.\n\nSome ECB-watchers have questioned the logic of moving now, however, especially as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has been stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings and is not expected to move till after the summer.\n\nMoney market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after Thursday's announcement and only priced in one more, with a slight risk of a second, for the remainder of the year.\n\nAsked if the ECB was moving into a phase of \"dialling back\" its tight monetary policy stance, Lagarde said she could not confirm such a process was underway, but that there was \"a strong likelihood\".\n\n\"But it will be data-dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she added.\n\nStronger-than-expected data about eurozone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to the ECB's goal - a concern expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nInflation in services, which some policymakers have singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, has been a particular concern after a rise to 4.1 per cent in May from 3.7 per cent a month earlier.\n\nAt the same time, a rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB by undermining the argument that high rates are choking economic activity.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may remain the Fed and whether it starts or further delays its own easing cycle.\n\nA more restrictive Fed would likely mean a weaker euro and higher imported inflation for the currency bloc, but it would also increase yields on global bond markets - a double whammy whose net effect is hard to predict.\n\n\"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the US and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said.\n\n\"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--h4ZaCpPm--/c_crop,h_432,w_768,x_0,y_53/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/ea582664f209bbe09c379702c5b56a3e2100777d.jpg?itok=7zgAk5EY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 111, "textEnd": 116}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

There is currently a 99% probability of a cut priced into the Eurozone swaps market. When a rate cut is so anticipated, the focus shifts to what comes next.\n\nAs we lead up to this meeting, there has been a recalibration of rate cut expectations for the ECB. There is only a 12% chance of a back-to-back cut in July, and the probability of rate cuts in September and December have been scaled back in recent days. There is now a 62% chance of a cut in September and a 54% chance of a cut in December. Even though the ECB is expected to cut rates on Thursday, this could be considered a hawkish cut, as the market expects the ECB to tread carefully when it comes to future rate cuts.\n\nThere is currently less than 2.5 rate cuts expected from the ECB this year, this is down from 3 rate cuts that had been expected in recent weeks. As you can see in the chart below, rate expectations for December have been rising sharply since January. The market now expects rates in the currency bloc to end the year at 3.27%, in January, this had been just above 2.2%. The outcome of this meeting will determine if longer term rate expectations continue to creep higher, or if they stabilize at this level.\n\nThe ECB will also release their updated macroeconomic forecasts at this meeting. These will be worth watching because the inflation rate ticked higher in May. Back in March, the last time the staff forecasts were updated, the ECB expected inflation to fall sharply in the coming years. Inflation was expected to be 2.3% in 2024, before falling further to 2% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. However, the inflation rate ticked up from 2.4% in April to 2.6% in May, which suggests that price pressures are moving in the opposite direction of the ECB's most recent forecasts. Added to this, price pressures may persist. For example, negotiated wage growth in the Eurozone rose by 4.7% in Q1 from 4.5% in Q3. Wage growth may persist since the unemployment rate in the Eurozone fell to a record low of 6.5% in Q1. This suggests that tightness in the Eurozone labour market could keep upward pressure on inflation down the line.\n\nThus, we could see the ECB upgrade their inflation forecasts for this year and next. If this happens, then we may see a further recalibration of ECB rate cuts in the coming days, with cuts pushed further out into the future.\n\nA number of ECB members have voiced concern about inflation pressures and the risk of cutting rates too far when inflation pressures remain, for example the heads of the German and the Austrian central banks. However, there is some pressure to cut rates at a faster clip. The Bank of Italy governor said on Tuesday that prompt, gradual cuts could avoid 'tardy, hasty ones later'. The contrasting stances between some ECB members makes the outlook for policy harder to gauge. We shall see if ECB President Lagarde can find a path that suits all members at this Thursday's meeting.\n\nOverall, we think that Lagarde will need to tread a more cautious path when it comes to future rate cuts. Not only are inflation pressures rising, but economic data has also ticked higher. The chart below shows the Citi economic surprise index for the US and the Eurozone (orange line). This chart shows that since the start of May, US economic data has surprised on the downside more often than European economic data. There are growing signs that the US economy is weakening sharply, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model is predicting Q2 GDP growth for the US to be 1.8%, down from 2.7% a week ago. With US economic data underperforming the Eurozone, the market may have to readjust its view that the ECB will cut rates more frequently than the Fed this year. If this occurs, then we may see two things happen: 1, rate cuts for the Eurozone get pushed further into the future and 2, upward pressure on the euro.\n\nEUR/USD has traded in a tight range in recent weeks, between $1.08 and $1.09, if the ECB upgrades their inflation forecasts then we could see the market test the $1.09 level and target $1.10. Stocks may also get hit. There has been a risk-off tone to markets this week as election surprises from Mexico and India dented sentiment towards global risky assets. A hawkish ECB could add to the downward pressure on risk assets. Italian stocks could be vulnerable, as higher interest rates in the currency bloc could hurt the most indebted members. Added to this, interest rate sensitive sectors in the Eurostoxx 600 index such as real estate and consumer discretionary stocks could also come under pressure.\n\nOverall, the ECB may shift to a more hawkish stance at this meeting, and a rate cut could be a one-off. The market has already reduced its expectations of ECB rate cuts for the rest of the year, but there could be further to go if the ECB staff forecasts revise inflation higher and if Christine Lagarde does not signal more rate cuts are in the picture for 2024.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/MonetaryPolicy/ECB/ecb-european-central-bank-frankfurt-germany-60052618_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Central banks in Switzerland and Sweden have also cut interest rates this year.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference later Thursday.\n\nAnalysts doubt the central bank will cut rates again at its next meeting in July. Eurozone inflation ticked up more than expected in May, to 2.6% from 2.4% the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also accelerated as wages grew rapidly.\n\nOn Thursday, the ECB raised its inflation forecast for this year, to 2.5% from the 2.3% predicted in March. It added that it would keep interest rates \"sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to return inflation to the 2% target.\n\nThe European economy, which only narrowly avoided a recession last year, is also showing signs of recovery, which could cause inflation to rise again.\n\nIn May, combined output in manufacturing and services hit a 12-month high, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank. Business confidence, meanwhile, reached its strongest level in more than two years.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said the data \"indicates... that the eurozone's economy is gathering further strength.\"\n\nThe ECB upgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from the 0.6% projected in March.\n\nAnother factor that could influence the central bank's thinking is the timing of rate cuts by the Fed, expected later this year. Policymakers in Frankfurt may be hesitant to move too far ahead of the Fed as that could cause the euro to lose value against the dollar, which could then push up inflation in Europe by raising the price of imports.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to attract more international capital flows into a country, lifting demand for its currency.\n\nTraders are all but certain the Fed will keep rates on hold at its meeting next week.

In new forecasts released with the widely flagged rate cut, the ECB said it expected inflation to average 2.2% in 2025 - up from a previous estimate of 2.0% and meaning it was now seen holding above the central bank's 2% target well into next year.\n\nInflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen to 2.6% from more than 10% in late 2022, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and an easing of post-pandemic supply snags. But that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that inflation may prove sticky, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nCutting its deposit rate to 3.75% from a record-high 4.0%, the ECB gave no indication as to whether that would be followed by a further easing in July. \"We are not pre-comitting to a particular rate path,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde told a press conference, reading from the Governing Council's statement.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\" With Thursday's move the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history.\n\nSome ECB-watchers have questioned the logic of moving now, however, especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve has been stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings and is not expected to move till after the summer. Money market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after Thursday's announcement and only priced in one more, with a slight risk of a second, for the remainder of the year.\n\nAsked if the ECB was moving into a phase of \"dialling back\" its tight monetary policy stance, Lagarde said she could not confirm such a process was underway, but that there was \"a strong likelihood\". \"But it will be data-dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she added.\n\nLAST MILE Stronger-than-expected data about euro zone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\" on the way to the ECB's goal - a concern expressed by influential board member Isabel Schnabel.\n\nInflation in services, which some policymakers have singled out as especially relevant because they reflect domestic demand, has been a particular concern after a rise to 4.1% in May from 3.7% a month earlier. At the same time, a rebound in growth also reduced the urgency for the ECB by undermining the argument that high rates are choking economic activity.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may remain the Fed and whether it starts or further delays its own easing cycle. A more restrictive Fed would likely mean a weaker euro and higher imported inflation for the currency bloc, but it would also increase yields on global bond markets - a double whammy whose net effect is hard to predict.\n\n\"The pace of rate cuts will be dependent on the U.S. and the Fed,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies said. \"In the event that the Fed doesn't cut rates at all this year - not our base case - we could see only two cuts from the ECB this year.\" (Editing by Toby Chopra, Sonali Paul and Catherine Evans)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Schnabel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabel Schnabel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/06_06_2024_04_32_22_6426054.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday.\n\nSuch a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nFILE - President of European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, attends a press conference after an ECB's governing council meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, on Jan. 25, 2024.

Analysts say a first rate cut is coming Thursday when the bank's policymakers meet in Frankfurt, Germany. . (AP Photo/Michael Probst, File)\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB\u00b4s goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently - from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 - even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe\u00b4s effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.\n\nFile - A roller coaster is pictured near the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

Notably, the ECB has previously hinted at a potential rate cut at their Frankfurt gathering today, as it reported progress in combating high inflation.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that ECB officials also stressed that the fight is not over due to persistent service price inflation. Despite that, the recent decision has sparked discussions over a potential similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve at their upcoming meetings.\n\nIn its latest meeting, the European Central Bank boosted market optimism with its latest announcement of a 0.25% cut in the interest rate to 4.25%. Meanwhile, the market was also anticipating a similar announcement from the ECB.\n\nThe ECB has increased the interest rate to 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023 to rein in the red-hot inflation. Meanwhile, the Euro Zone's headline inflation peaked at 10.6% in October, while the higher rates have helped the ECB to bring down the prices to 2.6% in the last month.\n\nNotably, the interest rates for the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility decreased to 4.25%, 4.50%, and 3.75%, respectively.\n\nAlthough inflation has still stood at the top of the 2% target range of the bank, the substantial decrease, as noted in May 2024, has helped the authorities to cut down the policy rates. As per the latest ECB projections from March 2024, the average inflation is anticipated to fall to 2% by next year, and 1.9% in 2026.\n\nOn the other hand, the projection showed that the core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, is anticipated to decrease to 2.1% in 2025 and 2% in the following year.\n\nInflation has been one of the major concerns globally, that has weighed on the investors' sentiment so far, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic and other geopolitical turmoil. Now, with the ECB announcing its first rate cut in years, anticipation has soared over a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve remained skeptical with their policy rate plans, the latest CPI data indicates that the inflation is cooling. However, with the latest PCE data still remaining at 2.7%, higher than the Fed's 2% target range, the lingering inflation rate casts a shadow on the Fed's rate cut decision.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rupam_roy@coingape.com", "name": "Rupam Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/european.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The European Central Bank just announced the probably best telegraphed start of an easing cycle ever. As expected, the ECB cut interest rates by 25bp, bringing the deposit rate down to 3.75%.\n\nToday's decision is unique in many ways. Not only is it one of the very few times that the ECB makes a turn on monetary policy before the Fed, it is also the first time the ECB starts cutting rates after a tightening cycle without facing any sort of recession or economic crisis. In fact, if it hadn't been for the very vocal communication since February, latest macro data could have easily justified another pause at today's meeting. The recent increase in wage growth and inflation as well as the economy gaining some positive momentum would have been strong arguments against the rate cut. In fact, it seems as if the ECB cut rates not so much because it had to, but simply because it could.\n\nWhat the rate cut does show is change within the ECB itself: the Bank has regained confidence in its own forecasting skills and takes enough comfort from the benign inflation forecast from the second half of 2025 onwards to justify cutting rates. It's like Asterix and his magic potion. In this regard, it is remarkable that the newest ECB projections show a slight upward revision to the 2025 inflation forecasts to 2.2%.\n\nAll of a sudden, the forecasts debunked and questioned by the ECB itself over the past few years have become powerful and influential again. There's nothing wrong with that, and the rate cut decision also marks an attempt to become a real forward-looking central bank again. Better perhaps that than an uncertain institution preoccupied with backwards-looking data. But it's also risky as sticky inflation and ongoing wage pressures could easily prove the ECB's forecasts wrong again soon.\n\nWe think that sticky inflation will limit the room for additonal rate cuts and the ECB's statement also doesn't give away any hints at the future path of the ECB. But let's here from ECB president Christine Lagarde at the press conference, starting at 2.45pm CET, how open the door for future rate cuts already is or whether the ECB will refrain from giving any forward guidance.\n\nSource: ING", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_guidance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward guidance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Overnight the EU saw the ECB hold its fourth rate-setting meet for 2024. It's a big call.\n\nCBA's international economics team reckons there'll be two further interest rate cuts from the BoC this year.\n\nAnd: \"We expect the European Central Bank to also cut its key policy rates by 25bps tonight.\"\n\nThat'll occur, barring some Euroinsanity, at around 10:15pm Sydenham time.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) was almost bagged as much as ours for being late to the raising party a few years ago when the world's major central banks began hoisting interest rates to combat the fattest inflation surge in many years.\n\nIt's unlikely to make the same mistake when it comes to slicing and dicing, from its current all-time high of 4%.\n\nThe move would follow similar decisions made by its regional central banks in Prague, Budapest, Sweden, and the Swiss.\n\nAside from the Canadians, it'd get the ball rolling among the world's biggest economies.\n\nThe slash-cut-slash theme of monetary policy easing, and some softer US data saw stocks rise on both sides of the Atlantic overnight.\n\nUS bond yields were around 5bps lower across the curve with the market almost fully priced for two cuts from the Fed this year.\n\nThe fact is recent weakness across European indices has started to weigh on global markets ahead of tonight's big European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision.\n\nThe ECB is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, reducing the main refinancing rate to 4.25%, the marginal lending rate to 4.50%, and the deposit rate to 3.75%.\n\nStrong economic data and some vocal hawks are seeing credit markets waver in their expectations for further cuts through 2024/5.\n\nFutures markets are still looking for three cuts over the next 12 months, but sticky inflation and rapid wage growth might slash a bit of this optimism, but for now the rhetoric from ECB officials since the (April 11) meet has left little doubt about the outcome.\n\nThe much-awaited rate decision will be announced at 12:15 GMT with a press statement followed by the usual press conference 30 minutes later featuring ECB boss and legende Christine LeGarde.\n\nPeter McGuire CEO at XM Australia says while it'll potentially be the first stab at high rates in many many moons, he's cognisant of the fact Ms Lagarde may have started to wish she hadn't been so clear with her messaging for a June cut.\n\n\"\n\nBecause everyone's wondering what comes next after what'd be an historic pivot.\n\nPolicymakers have clearly communicated their intention to lower borrowing costs over the past couple of weeks, though the latest uptick in the CPI inflation numbers convinced traders that a continuous easing policy should not be guaranteed.\n\nSince the April ECB meeting, data out of the EU has been fairly positive.\n\nThe recent business surveys and the continued tightness of the labour market portray an economy in recovery.\n\nHowever, according to Market Matters, keeping rates stable on Thursday following the barrage of dovish commentary could be \"an enormous hit on ECB's credibility.\"\n\n\"Which is already in tatters following 2021-2023 inflation jump. Therefore, ECB members are expected to ignore the recent pick-up in inflation and announce the much-awaited rate cut.\"\n\nThe market is somewhat worried about the fact that the ECB will make the first move, ahead of the Fed, for the first time in its short history, says McGuire.\n\n\"Up to now, the Fed has always been dictating the start, the end, and the pace of any monetary policy cycle. But with US inflation remaining sticky and the US Presidential elections being only a few months away, Chairman Powell et al have opted to stay on the sidelines.\"\n\nInterestingly, he says, the fact that the ECB is making the first move could be interpreted in several ways.\n\n\"One could assume that the Fed is falling behind the curve for the first time in a while, or that the ECB could be making a mistake, like ex-President's Trichet rate hike move in the summer of 2008, by cutting rates now that the economy is recovering.\"\n\nWith the rate cut decision being pretty much pre-announced the market's reaction would depend on three factors:\n\n(a) The size of the rate\n\nCertain ultra-doves tried to pitch the idea for a 50bps rate move. Their aim was to send a very strong message to the market about the ECB's willingness to ensure inflation does not undershoot. However, this plan has probably been abandoned following Friday's hotter CPI report.\n\n(b) The new Eurosystem staff projections\n\nIn March, the inflation projection for 2026 stood at 1.9%, in line with ECB's price stability target. A significant revision of this figure could determine ECB's strategy during 2024.\n\n(c) President Lagarde's comments about the July meeting\n\nECB members have been publicly debating about the need for back-to-back rate cuts and hence Lagarde's comments on this issue could give a strong indication of the behind-the-door discussions.\n\n\"The market is currently expecting a 25bps rate cut on Thursday, small revisions of the inflation projections and for President Lagarde to keep the door open to a July move.\"\n\nPeter says that in this case, the euro/dollar is expected to test the busy 1.0772-1.0806 area.\n\n\"The Fed is not expected to cut interest rates before September according to futures markets, and although the wolves of Wall Street are not fond of this scenario, the US dollar can enjoy more winning moments in FX markets.\n\n\"Should President Lagarde et al decide to cut rates but refrain for commenting on the July meeting's outcome, giving the impression what there was no widespread support for a similar-sized move in 45 days, the euro could get a boost with the recent high of 1.0894 being the first target.\"\n\nThe Fed's favourite core PCE inflation index held steady at 2.8% y/y last week - as analysts anticipated - increasing concerns that the pace of price increases might stay above the central bank's 2.0% target for longer.\n\nPeter says this risk could be heightened by the release of upcoming data, with investors eagerly awaiting a strong employment report and better business conditions.\n\n\"Friday's US nonfarm payrolls are forecast to bounce up to 190k in May from 175k previously, keeping the unemployment rate flat at 3.9%. Average hourly earnings are expected to hold stable as well at 3.9% y/y. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing business PMI figures could remain robust in the expansion area, further justifying the delay of rate cuts.\n\n\"In the event of a negative surprise, traders might back a September rate cut. Note that there is no policy meeting scheduled in October and before the US election. Thus, the timing of September's gathering could be ideal for implementing policy changes if the labor market data indicate significant weakness.\"\n\nFutures markets provide 82% probability for a June rate cut, but the odds for a July reduction are also high given the relatively sluggish employment and GDP growth in the Canadian economy.\n\nSince mid-April, the market has already removed one rate cut from its forecast, and \"we wouldn't be surprised to see another one bite the dust\", Market Matters said on Wednesday in a note to clients.\n\n\"We are looking for slow and steady rate cuts, nothing overzealous.\n\n\"Christine Lagarde has shown herself to be a prudent ECB President, and we believe she will remain data-dependent moving forward; no central bank leader wants to be recognised for letting inflation back out of the bag after spending recent years fighting against it. The key takeout is that there is more chance of less, not more, rate cuts than hoped over the coming year.\"\n\nStock markets generally like low-interest rate environments, hence the overnight pullback across European indices, although, to put things into perspective, they are still trading around their all-time high.\n\nMarket Matters' concern is that if they do enjoy another leg higher, the risk/reward will start to deteriorate, making stock selection more important than ever.\n\n\"The knock-on concern for subscribers should be the ASX's strong correlation to European indices, i.e., if they pullback, we are likely to follow suit. Our ideal target area for the EURO STOXX is the 5300 area, or 7% higher.\"\n\nThe key question in market participants' minds is when the Fed is going to start easing its monetary policy stance.\n\nThe year started with market pricing in at least five rate cuts by the Fed in 2024, but with inflation remaining above 3% since July 2023, expectations have tanked.\n\nWith the ECB and the Bank of England possibly following suit in early August, the pressure is on the Fed to turn dovish and cut rates in September ahead of the November US Presidential elections.\n\n\"Otherwise, it might have to wait until December when either the Fed would potentially be significantly behind the curve, or the US economy might not need a more accommodative monetary policy stance,\" McGuire told Stockhead.\n\nBased on the Fed's mandate, McGuire says there are two key reasons for the Fed to start cutting rates:\n\n(a) weak economic data, and particularly lower inflation, and\n\n(b) a severe risk-off episode in stock markets that threatens the stability of the system.\n\n\"Higher inflation during 2024 has been attributed to the elevated oil prices and the strong domestic demand. Encouragingly for the Fed doves, oil prices have been under severe pressures in the past few sessions and hence opening the door to lower inflationary pressures ahead.\n\n\"Similarly, increased wage earnings have been fuelling consumer appetite and cancelled out most of the impact of the higher cost of money. However, both the consumer confidence index and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey have been recently showing signs of weakness.\n\n\"Focusing on this week's key data calendar and an array of weaker prints, for example a sub-100k increase in non-farm payrolls led by weaker private payrolls, and a decent jump in the unemployment rate, could increase exponentially the pressure on the Fed to turn dovish at next week's gathering and prepare for a rate cut in September.\"\n\nPeter says financial stability is taken very seriously by the Fed, especially following the March 2023 events with the failure of three mid-sized banks.\n\n\"Therefore, another unexpected surge in US yields, on the back of stronger US data, is bound to increase the Fed members' concerns about similar bank failures.\n\n\"Similarly, the Fed does not enjoy massive risk-off episodes that cause acute stock market moves. Seasoned market participants are aware of the famous 'Fed put' - the belief that the Fed would step in and act appropriately to limit the stock market's decline.\"\n\nData this week has significant market-moving potential.\n\n\"A strong set of prints on Friday, for example a sizeable upside surprise in the non-farm payroll figures and a jump in average earnings, could trigger a stock market correction, which could gradually evolve into a crash as market participants realize that the chances of a rate cut before December are extremely low.\"\n\nIn this case, Fed officials might be forced to react by delivering the much-awaited rate cut much faster than currently foreseen, and despite the recent economic data not fully justifying such a move.\n\nTherefore, while intuitively a weaker set of data this week opens the door to a dovish tilt at the June meeting, a very strong set of data prints could push US treasury yields much higher and gradually result in a severe stock market correction.\n\nMaybe the threat of financial instability could be the catalyst that the Fed doves has been craving.", "source": {"uri": "stockhead.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stockhead"},

But it looks like the central bank won't be late when it comes to cutting them.\n\nThe European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates at its June 6 meeting, as widely signaled in recent weeks by its policymakers.\n\nThis will mark the first cut since March 2016 for both the main refinancing operations rate and the marginal lending rate. For the deposit rate, it will be the first reduction since September 2019.\n\nWill the ECB continue to cut rates after June?\n\nDespite the widely anticipated rate cut in June, recent remarks from ECB officials suggest there will be no pre-commitment to future cuts afterward.\n\nData released on Friday showed that headline and core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) both accelerated more than expected in May. Eurozone inflation also edged higher in the same month, reaching 2.6% above the expected 2.5%, while core inflation rose to 2.9% from 2.7% in April.\n\nFigure 1: Eurozone: Key interest rate and inflation over five years, Source: Morning Star\n\nMoney markets are currently pricing in 43 basis points of ECB cuts by September and approximately 60 basis points by the end of the year. As a result, market expectations are caught between predicting 2-3 ECB rate cuts in 2024.\n\nFigure 2: Traders slash ECB rate cut bets, Source: Reuters\n\ntraders will listen carefully to Lagarde's press conference and the ECB staff's new macroeconomic forecasts, looking for signals on the pace of rate cuts after June and, in particular, a possible second cut at the July 18 meeting\n\nWill the ECB Cut Before the Fed?\n\nAlso, weighing on the ECB's move in June is the possible divergence from the Fed. The Federal Reserve is expected to delay rate cuts, and the market no longer anticipates a cut in July. This could widen the rate differential between the US and Europe, potentially causing funds to flow to the US and weakening the euro.\n\nThe ECB institution has repeatedly said in recent months that it is independent of the US central bank, but economists are debating how far monetary policies on both sides of the ocean can really diverge.\n\nAnalysts explain that a sharp divergence could weaken the single currency against the dollar, with potential upside risk to inflation forcing the ECB to become more cautious.\n\nThe content published above has been prepared by CFI for informational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advice.

The rate trajectory of the ECB will depend on the evolution of data from here on and the Fed, which we think will be unable to cut this year given the stickiness in US inflation.\"\n\nThe ECB cut may put pressure on the Bank of England to follow suit.\n\nThe next monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting is on 20 June and there are factors that could encourage rates to be cut from their 16-year high.\n\nThe rate of inflation has been getting closer to the 2% target while the latest Purchasing Managers' Index hit a six-month low in April, suggesting the restrictive policy is doing its job.\n\nHowever, wage growth remains high and the Bank of England may want to avoid a June cut due to the general election on 4 July and the risk that the move looks politicised.\n\nThis could make a rate cut more likely in the next MPC meeting on 1 August.\n\nThe risk is moving too early though before inflation has settled.\n\nBen Nichols, interim managing director at Raw Capital Partners, says: \"The outlook for energy prices is unreliable and geopolitical conflict in Europe and the Middle East could create major challenges further down the line.\"", "source": {"uri": "moneyweek.com",

The ECB last year raised its benchmark deposit rate to a record 4 per cent, putting a chokehold on economic activity to tackle the biggest price surge for a generation.\n\n\"Lower rates do matter,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German bank Berenberg. \"Financial markets are well aware this is coming, but news that the ECB has started to cut rates could draw [the] attention of households and businesses, and lift sentiment.\"\n\nThe euro zone economy already showed tentative signs of a recovery in the first three months of this year, when gross domestic product in the bloc rose 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter - ending a year of stagnation.\n\n[ The Irish Times view on ECB interest rates: it is time for the first reduction from record highs ]\n\nThe growth spurt mostly reflected the fading-out of an energy and food price shock triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and a pickup in global trade, Schmieding said.\n\nBut he said the anticipation of rate cuts had also helped to lower the cost of mortgages and corporate loans. \"This will lead to a bottoming-out in housing markets, a recovery in house building, and should help investment to recover, as we expect it to this year.\"\n\nIn Germany, house prices fell 10 per cent after the ECB started raising rates in 2022. But this year they are stabilising after 10-year mortgage rates dropped from almost 4 per cent last October to below 3.2 per cent, according to mortgage broker Dr Klein.\n\n\"The more favourable interest rates since then have led to a noticeable increase in demand for mortgage financing, and the market has experienced a significant upturn since then,\" said Michael Neumann, Dr Klein's head of private clients.\n\n[ ECB says consumer inflation expectations declined in April, reinforcing rate cut ]\n\nMarc van der Lee at the Dutch association of estate agents predicted that house prices in the Netherlands would rebound to record highs in the second quarter, mainly reflecting rising wages and a shortage of housing, but also lifted by lower mortgage costs.\n\nAs for further moves after Thursday's meeting, the problem for Lagarde is that the steady fall of inflation from its peak above 10 per cent in 2022 has been interrupted. Data published last week showed that annual price growth accelerated again to 2.6 per cent in May from 2.4 per cent a month earlier.\n\nThe euro zone's unexpectedly strong labour market is also keeping price pressures high, with collective wage growth rising back to a record pace of 4.7 per cent in the first quarter, and unemployment in the bloc falling to a new low of 6.4 per cent in April.\n\nMost economists think the recent strong data means the ECB will have to slightly lift both its inflation forecast of 2.3 per cent for this year and its GDP growth prediction of 0.6 per cent.\n\nCombined with signs that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to start cutting rates for several months - if at all this year - as a result of a strong US economy, investors have scaled back their bets to fewer than three quarter-point cuts by the ECB this year.\n\n[ Mortgage arrears in danger of spiking even as ECB starts to cut its rates ]\n\nThe timing of this week's rate cut will be unusual for the ECB because it usually only launches such monetary easing in response to a crisis, such as after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 or when Greece needed a series of bailouts in 2011.\n\nEven the ECB's last rate cut in September 2019 was a reaction to weakening growth and inflation dropping below its 2 per cent target.\n\n\"They are cutting into an improving situation, rather than a deteriorating one,\" said Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at French bank BNP Paribas. \"This means they will be in no rush to cut rates further, which makes another cut in July unlikely and steers them towards only cutting once every quarter.\"\n\nInfluential members of the ECB's rate-setting governing council have already hinted they expect a gradual pace of easing, with only two further rate cuts likely this year.\n\nECB chief economist Philip Lane said last month that rates were likely to \"move down somewhat\" over the year while staying in \"restrictive territory\", which most economists assume means remaining above 3 per cent.\n\n[ ECB's Schnabel sounds cautious note on pace of rate cuts ]\n\nDutch central bank chief Klaas Knot told an event in London last week that based on the ECB's latest forecasts its models showed \"the optimal policy would have been broadly in line with three to four rate cuts\" by year-end.\n\nFor inflation to fall to the ECB's 2 per cent target by next summer, it is counting on a combination of slowing wage growth, increasing worker productivity and shrinking company profit margins.\n\nIf these trends fail to materialise and inflation stays uncomfortably high, Hollingsworth said rate-setters \"may have to pause after the first couple of cuts\".\n\nFacing such uncertainty over the economic outlook, Lagarde is widely expected to resist giving much of a sign on the likely policy path, enabling the bank to preserve maximum flexibility on the extent of rate cuts for as long as possible. - Copyright The

A cut would be the ECB's first since September 2019, when the deposit facility was in negative territory.\n\nMarkets have only fully priced one further reduction this year, but economists polled by Reuters last week forecast two more cuts taking place over the period.\n\nInvestors will be monitoring the language used in the Governing Council's statement and the tone struck by ECB President Christine Lagarde in her press conference at 2:45 p.m. Frankfurt time.\n\nEspecially important will be the fresh quarterly projections on economic growth and inflation set to be released by ECB staff.\n\nThough the ECB began hiking interest rates later, a June cut would put it ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve on its march lower, as the world's largest central bank remains stymied by the rate of U.S. inflation. Lagarde nevertheless said in her last press conference that ECB officials are \"data-dependent, not Fed-dependent.\"\n\nCanada on Wednesday became the first G7 nation to cut interest rates in the current cycle, while Sweden and Switzerland's central banks already announced their own rate reductions this year.\n\nEuropean Central Bank policymakers are set to cut interest rates on Thursday, as the path ahead for inflation appears reassuring, Shaan Raithatha, senior economist at Vanguard Europe told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday. He added that multiple such rate reductions are on the horizon for 2024.\n\n\"Aside from slight momentum in services inflation in the most recent months it feels like the ECB have enough conviction to go ahead later today,\" he said. \"The inflation outlook is looking promising.\"\n\nECB policymakers have also sent a \"strong signal\" that there will be further interest rate cuts beyond the one expected on Thursday, Raithatha said.\n\n-- Sophie Kiderlin\n\nThe European Central Bank is likely to look past recent \"bad news\" on inflation to cut interest rates in June, but may only opt for one more reduction this year, Jean-Claude Trichet, former European Central Bank president, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"My intuition is that they will pull the trigger and decrease rates by point 25 percent, even if there has been some bad news... as regards the goal, which is to stabilize prices and having inflation going down,\" Trichet said.\n\nBad news includes the recent upticks in headline inflation, core inflation and services inflation, and negotiated wages picking up in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe good news is that euro zone unemployment is at an all-time low and purchasing managers' index figures indicate an ongoing economic recovery, he added.\n\n\"We must accept that data could [change] month-on-month or quarter-to-quarter so we must be prudent... based on current data, instead of thinking [the ECB] would decrease [interest rates] twice after June, it is more reasonable to think of one decrease of rates,\" Trichet said.\n\n\"But again this is my central intuition, it can change. We could have a lot of better news as regards inflation and we could have even more bad news,\" he added.\n\n-- Jenni Reid\n\nAzad Zangana, senior European economist and strategist at Schroders, told CNBC on Tuesday he sees the ECB following through with its June cut, and then opting for reductions at alternate meetings for the rest of the year.\n\nThat would mean a total of three cuts implemented this year, with follow-ups in September and December, in line with the forecast in a recent Reuters poll of economists.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Trichet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Claude Trichet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schroders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/06/107424554-1717602564104-gettyimages-2147051766-GERMANY_ECB.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 527, "textEnd": 541}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It no longer expects inflation to hit its two-percent target in 2025, as previously expected, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nWhile noting that \"the inflation outlook has improved markedly\", the ECB said in a statement that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year\".\n\nIt reiterated typical language that it would \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to hit its inflation target, and that it would take a \"data-dependent\" approach to is decisions.\n\nDecisions would be based on the inflation outlook, it said, while adding that the rate-setting governing council \"is not pre-committing to a particular rate path\".\n\nThursday's cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski said \"sticky inflation will limit the room for additional rate cuts and the ECB's statement also doesn't give away any hints at the future path of the ECB\".\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB president Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nThe chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday.\n\nSuch a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type":

Whether there'll be a third cut in 2024 is hotly debated and markets are no longer pricing in more than two cuts.\n\n\"The last thing the ECB would want to do is to have to raise rates if next month's inflation numbers flare up again. So the cure is to not be rushed into decisions\", said Michael Field, European markets strategist at Morningstar. \"We've come a long way from the 10.6% highs in inflation, witnessed just 18 months ago, and at this point lower interest rates seem appropriate.\"\n\nEquity, bond and currency markets reactions were muted as the move had been widely anticipated.\n\nThe interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be revised down by 0.25 percentage points each to 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75% respectively, effective June 12, according to the statement.\n\nThe latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe ECB governing council wrote history as it was the first time that the European bank acted ahead of its U.S. counterpart in a rate move. But the cut followed similar moves of other major Western central banks. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) was the first major bank to announce a rate cut in March, followed by Sweden's Riskbank in May. Yesterday, the Bank of Canada announced it will cut its overnight rate to 4.75% after six consecutive pauses.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of England (BoE) will announce their monetary policy decision on June 12 and 20, respectively. In the US, rate cuts are delayed owing to first quarter inflation surprise, says Preston Caldwell, Morningstar's US economist. \"Our year-end 2024 federal funds rate expectation moves to 4.75%-5.00% from 4.25%-4.50% previously.\"\n\nMost analysts agree that the ECB will keep rates unchanged at its July 18 meeting, but resume cuts at a slow pace of 0.25 percentage points at its September 12 meeting.\n\n\"Had the ECB not telegraphed the rate cut this week so emphatically, we believe that there would have been a heated debate around whether to wait for more data following the less than supportive wage and inflation prints over the last couple of weeks. It is highly likely that Lagarde will guide markets to a hold at July, with the next adjustment either in September or October\", Dave Chappell, Senior Fund Manager, Fixed Income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said in a note ahead of today's ECB decision.\n\nKarsten Junius, Chief Economist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable, agrees that a September rate cut is the most likely scenario. \"We believe that monetary policy has been too restrictive for too long. We therefore expect further rate cuts in September, October and December, towards a level of 3.0% by the end of the year. For their part, the markets are currently pricing in a level of 3.3% for December\", he said in a note prior to today's meeting.\n\n\"In our view, financial markets do not expect sufficient rate cuts this year. The euro area clearly differs from the United States and we expect the ECB to act independently of the Federal Reserve and according to its domestic needs.\"\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, expects two more cuts this year. \"The market is currently pricing in the prospect of two further rate cuts this year, and rates in the Eurozone are expected to end 2024 at 3.25%, compared with 4.84% for the US\", she said.\n\nEquity markets tend to rise on anticipated rate cuts, while bond markets tend to suffer. On the other hand, with interest rates already high, falling rates also mean lower bond yields, which pushes bond prices higher. Lower rates also make existing bonds, and particularly those already issued during a period of high rates, more attractive for yields.\n\nMeanwhile cash savings rates on bank accounts will likely decrease, to the detriment of savers. Borrowers, by contrast, stand to benefit from lower rates as consumer debt and mortgages become cheaper. In its latest Economic Bulletin, the ECB said lending rates on business loans have already declined slightly, to 5.2% in late 2023, while mortgage rates increased further to 4.0%.", "source": {"uri":

The European Central Bank appears ready to start cutting interest borrowing costs for businesses and consumers - and do it ahead of the Fed. Analysts say a first rate [...]\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank plans to move ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday in cutting interest rates, making the eurozone the biggest rich-world economy to start easing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers as the inflation that arose after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine slowly recedes.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde and other officials have made it clear that a quarter-point rate cut from the current record high of 4% is more than likely when the bank's 26-member governing council meets at the institution's skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nLagarde said late last month that she was \"really confident\" inflation was under control in the eurozone, the 20 European Union countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB sets monetary policy. Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday.\n\nSuch a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

The ECB's governing council will meet on Thursday. The European Central Bank appears ready to start cutting interest borrowing costs for businesses and consumers - and do it ahead of the Fed. Analysts say a first rate cut is coming Thursday when the bank's policymakers meet in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank plans to move ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday in cutting interest rates, making the eurozone the biggest rich-world economy to start easing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers as the inflation that arose after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine slowly recedes.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde and other officials have made it clear that a quarter-point rate cut from the current record high of 4% is more than likely when the bank's 26-member governing council meets at the institution's skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nLagarde said late last month that she was \"really confident\" inflation was under control in the eurozone, the 20 European Union countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB sets monetary policy. Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday.\n\nSuch a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki",

But future cuts may be limited - Medicine Hat News", "body": "SUBSCRIBE NOW FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point, moving ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve as central banks around the world lean toward lowering borrowing costs - a shift with far-reaching consequences for home buyers, savers and investors. The ECB cut its benchmark rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4% at a meeting of the bank's 26-member rate-setting council in Frankfurt. Speaking afterward at a news conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde said inflation had eased enough for the central bank to start lowering rates. But with inflation in the eurozone expected to remain above the ECB's 2% target into next year, Lagarde declined to say how fast or how deep any future rate cuts might be. \"Price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\"\u009d she said. \"We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim... We are not committing to a particular rate path.\"\u009d Analysts say Thursday's quarter-point rate cut will likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the ECB waits to make sure inflation has been brought under control. Though the annual inflation rate for May - 2.6% - is well below a peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months. Inflation even ticked up slightly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains particularly elevated at 4.1%. The ECB's move represents a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds.

The Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation. Central bank benchmarks are a big deal for governments, companies, home buyers, investors and and savers. The benchmarks influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can boost stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and can mean stronger economic growth that will boost corporate earnings. Rate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently. The ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in eurozone home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production, raising fears that high rates could slow Europe's transition away from fossil fuels under the 2015 Paris climate accords. The inflation surge in Europe was unleashed first and foremost by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%. As the central bank with the world's dominant currency, what the Fed does spreads ripples far and wide. Widening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could in theory weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive. But in practice the euro has actually strengthened recently - from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 - even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks. The Federal Reserve faces a very different economy, one in which inflation was fueled less by the Russian energy shock than by government pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12.

Her remark and statements by other ECB officials have analysts convinced that a rate cut is a done deal for Thursday.\n\nSuch a move would represent a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started about four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Particular attention will be on the new quarterly projections for economic growth and inflation from ECB staff.\n\nThe ECB's recent decision puts it ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve in terms of rate cuts, as the Fed continues to grapple with high U.S. inflation. ECB President Lagarde emphasized that their policy decisions are \"data-dependent, not Fed-dependent.\" Notably, Canada has also reduced interest rates, becoming the first G7 nation to do so in the current cycle, followed by Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nGiven the ECB's proactive approach to moderating monetary policy and the ongoing inflation challenges, the outlook for the euro zone market is cautiously bullish. Traders should prepare for potential further rate cuts as the ECB continues to adapt its policies in response to economic data.\n\nOverall, the ECB's rate cut reflects a strategic shift to balance inflation control with economic support, signaling potential opportunities for investors in the euro zone markets.", "source": {"uri": "fxempire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXEmpire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hyerczyk@fxempire.com", "name": "James Hyerczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/06/ECB5.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 426, "textEnd": 440}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

This will make the eurozone its biggest economy in the rich world to start lowering the cost of borrowing money for businesses and consumers as the inflation that grew after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine slowly goes down.\n\nAccording to ECB President Christine Lagarde and other officials, the rate will almost certainly be cut by a quarter percent from its current record high of 4% when the bank's 26-member governing council meets at its building offices in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nFor the 20 European Union countries that use the euro and for which the ECB sets monetary policy, Lagarde said at the end of last month that she was \"really confident\" that inflation was under control. Analysts are sure that a rate cut will happen on Thursday based on what she said and what other ECB officials have said.\n\nThis would be different from how things were before the inflation spike. At that time, the Federal Reserve took the lead in tightening credit by raising interest rates starting in March 2022. This made mortgage rates go up but also helped people with money in CDs or money market funds earn more.\n\nInterest rates are likely to go down soon at most major central banks around the world. A number of smaller economies, such as Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, have already cut interest rates.\n\nAs of now, it's not clear if the governing board of the Bank of England will lower the rate from 5.25% when they meet on June 20. Japan's economy is different from the world's big economies. After years of below 0 rates and low inflation, Japan has started to raise rates.\n\nEurope's inflation rate went through the roof when Russia cut off most of the continent's natural gas sources. As the world economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, there were also delays in getting raw materials and parts to Europe.\n\nThe Russian cutoff hurt the eurozone the most, but the energy price spike that followed has mostly gone away. In May, inflation dropped to 2.6%, down from a high of 10.6% in October 2022 and close to the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nWith more strong growth, government support and COVID recovery spending, as well as higher prices, the Federal Reserve is dealing with a different economy. The U.S. consumer price index is 3.4% a year, which is a long way from the Fed's goal of 2%.\n\nFrom the current average level of 5.25% to 5.5%, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the bank plans to cut rates this year. However, there will likely be no change at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11th and 12th. As U.S. inflation slowly falls, experts and investors are becoming more and more certain that there will only be one or two cuts this year.\n\nSome people think that making the rate difference between the U.S. and Europe bigger could hurt the euro against the dollar by getting more investment money to leave the eurozone and hold dollars instead, where they can earn more. Imports would cost more, which would hurt the ECB's fight against inflation.\n\nBut the euro has been getting stronger lately -- it went from $1.06 in mid-April to around $1.09 now -- even though the ECB has been hinting for weeks that rates will be going up.\n\nRate hikes fight inflation by making it more expensive to borrow money to buy things. This lowers demand, which lessens the pressure on prices. But high rates also slow down growth, and the eurozone economy hasn't been growing much lately.\n\nFor more than a year, economic growth has been just above and below zero. The first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the previous quarter, came as a small but welcome surprise.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. \"the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\"\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say that the bank will probably not make a lot of more cuts right away after the quarter-point cut on Thursday. This is because the bank wants to make sure that inflation is under control before easing credit to help the economy. The level of inflation in the services sector, which includes things like haircuts, medical care, hotels, restaurants, and event tickets, is still high at 4.1%.\n\nKey interest rates set by central banks are important for everyone, not just investors. Rates affect how much it costs to borrow money across the economy. For consumers, lower rates can mean lower mortgage and credit card costs. Lower interest rates can also raise the prices of stocks and the value of retirement accounts. This is because they lower the profits on safe investments like bank accounts and CDs compared to stocks, which makes buyers want to buy risky stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates ended a nine-year rise in home prices and slowed down building, which is very sensitive to changes in the cost of borrowing money. The initial costs of building new green energy production have also gone up because interest rates have gone up. This is because Europe is trying to move away from fossil fuels and fight climate change in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreements.\n\nBloomberg's measure of national bond returns went up for the fifth day in a row on Wednesday as investors bet more on monetary easing in countries from the US to Australia. If they keep making gains for six days, it will be the best run since November.\n\nIn the past week, traders have increased their bets on rate cuts. This is because a lot of US economic data came in weaker than expected, and the Bank of Canada decided to loosen monetary policy. On Friday, US non-farm payrolls figures will show new signs of whether growth is slowing enough in the world's largest economy. This will test the excitement about bonds once more.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG's Asia Pacific chief investment officer, Stefanie Holtze-Jen, said that markets \"are at that inflection point now\" in terms of demand for bonds. \"That belief will grow stronger as soon as more data from the US shows that growth is slowing down.\"\n\nWhat the European Central Bank does later Thursday will be very important for buyers. According to polls of experts by Bloomberg, the bank will likely cut interest rates. A bad picture for the US economy means that the biggest and most active bond market in the world may not be as bullish as people would like.\n\nA note from Rabobank's global analyst Michael Every said, \"Recent data on the US labor market suddenly looks wobbly. Many in the market are again thinking that 'rate cuts!' won the battle of ideas and that the war against inflation is over for good.\" \"That can be true in some places, and progress will be made.\"\n\nBets on the Market\n\nSwap markets show that buyers think interest rates will go down more often than not for now.\n\nBased on swaps linked to the Federal Reserve's policy rate, there is a 90% chance of two quarter-point cuts by the end of the year. This is up from 47% at the end of May. Futures buyers think there is a 51% chance that the Reserve Bank of Australia will lower rates by December. Rates were 9% at the end of last month.\n\nThis feeling is also spreading to Japan, which is the only other big economy where investors think interest rates on loans will go up. By the end of the year, the price of Bank of Japan rate hikes in swaps had dropped from 29 basis points on May 31 to 23 basis points.\n\nKnowing the right way for rates is more important to investors like State Street Global Advisors than knowing when to cut rates.\n\n\"Our core view is that inflation will continue \" Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income, and Matthew Coolidge, fixed-income portfolio manager, wrote in a report. \"allowing the Fed to implement a series of rate cuts that take short-term rates to more appropriate levels,\"", "source": {"uri":

Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nThe move represents a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Canada cut rates Wednesday. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal for governments, companies, home buyers, investors and and savers. The benchmarks influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can boost stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and can mean stronger economic growth that will boost corporate earnings.\n\nThe ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in eurozone home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production, raising fears that high rates could slow Europe's transition away from fossil fuels under the 2015 Paris climate accords.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed first and foremost by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nAs the central bank with the world's dominant currency, what the Fed does spreads ripples far and wide. Lagarde has said however that \"we are data dependent, we are not Fed dependent,\" although ECB officials take into account economic conditions outside Europe, including the U.S. but also Japan and China.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive. But in practice the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from US$1.06 in mid-April to its current level around US$1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a very different economy, one in which inflation was fuelled less by the Russian energy shock than by government pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fuelled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg

It no longer expects inflation to hit its two-percent target in 2025, as previously expected, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nWhile noting that \"the inflation outlook has improved markedly\", the ECB said in a statement that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year\".\n\nIt reiterated typical language that it would \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to hit its inflation target, and that it would take a \"data-dependent\" approach to is decisions.\n\nDecisions would be based on the inflation outlook, it said, while adding that the rate-setting governing council \"is not pre-committing to a particular rate path\".\n\n- No rapid easing -\n\nThursday's cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski said \"sticky inflation will limit the room for additional rate cuts and the ECB's statement also doesn't give away any hints at the future path of the ECB\".\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB president Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nThe chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nsr/hmn/lth", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com",

(Reuters)\n\nThe European Central Bank cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter point, moving ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve as central banks around the world lean toward lowering borrowing costs - a shift with far-reaching consequences for home buyers, savers and investors.\n\nThe ECB cut its benchmark rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4% at a meeting of the bank's 26-member rate-setting council in Frankfurt. The ECB said in a statement that \"price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" allowing it to start loosening credit. The bank warned however that \"wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\" It declined to signal how far or how fast it might cut, saying it would decide meeting by meeting.\n\nAnalysts say the quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. While inflation at an annual rate of 2.6% in May is well down from peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months and inflation even ticked up slightly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nThe move represents a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started four months later. Major central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates.\n\nCentral banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation. Central bank benchmarks are a big deal for governments, companies, home buyers, investors and and savers.\n\nThe benchmarks influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can boost stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and can mean stronger economic growth that will boost corporate earnings. The ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in eurozone home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs.\n\nHigher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production, raising fears that high rates could slow Europe's transition away from fossil fuels under the 2015 Paris climate accords.The inflation surge in Europe was unleashed first and foremost by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.Although the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nAs the central bank with the world's dominant currency, what the Fed does spreads ripples far and wide. Lagarde has said however that \"we are data dependent, we are not Fed dependent,\" although ECB officials take into account economic conditions outside Europe, including the U.S. but also Japan and China.Widening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut in practice the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.The Federal Reserve faces a very different economy, one in which inflation was fueled less by the Russian energy shock than by government pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg

But with inflation in the eurozone expected to remain above the ECB's 2 percent target into next year, Lagarde declined to say how fast or how deep any future rate cuts might be.\n\n\"Price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" she said. \"We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim... We are not committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nREAD: ECB to start cutting rates from record highs\n\nAnalysts say Thursday's quarter-point rate cut will likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the ECB waits to make sure inflation has been brought under control. Though the annual inflation rate for May -- 2.6 percent -- is well below a peak of 10.6 percent in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months. Inflation even ticked up slightly from 2.4 percent in April.\n\nInflation in service sectors still elevated\n\nInflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants, and concert tickets, remains particularly elevated at 4.1 percent.\n\nThe ECB's move represents a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started four months later.\n\nMajor central banks around the world are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n\nREAD: Canada central bank cuts key lending rate, signals more ahead\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25 percent.\n\nJapan, an economic outlier among the world's big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal for governments, companies, home buyers, investors, and savers. The benchmarks influence borrowing costs across the economy so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers.\n\nLower rates can also boost stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks and can mean stronger economic growth that will boost corporate earnings.\n\nRate increases to combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow to buy goods, lowering demand, and taking the pressure off prices.\n\nBut high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nThe ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in eurozone home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs.\n\nHigher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production, raising fears that high rates could slow Europe's transition away from fossil fuels under the 2015 Paris climate accords.\n\nEurope's elevated inflation\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed first and foremost by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6 percent in May, down from a peak of 10.6 percent in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2 percent.\n\nAs the central bank with the world's dominant currency, what the Fed does spreads ripples far and wide. Widening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could in theory weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns.\n\nThat would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive. But in practice, the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level of around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a very different economy, one in which inflation was fueled less by the Russian energy shock than by government pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4 percent, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2 percent.\n\nFed rate cut hopes\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25 percent -5.5 percent, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\n\"If anything,

rates for the first time since 2019", "body": "The European Central Bank (ECB) went ahead with its first interest rate cut since 2019 on Thursday, citing progress in tackling inflation even as it acknowledged the fight was far from over.\n\nIn new forecasts released with the widely flagged rate cut, the ECB said it expected inflation to average 2.2 per cent in 2025 -- up from a previous estimate of 2 per cent and meaning it was now seen holding above the central bank's 2 per cent target well into next year.\n\nInflation in the 20 countries that share the euro has fallen to 2.6 per cent from more than 10 per cent in late 2022, largely thanks to lower fuel costs and an easing of post-pandemic supply snags.\n\nBut that progress has stalled recently and what had looked like the start of a major ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appears more uncertain due to signs that inflation may prove sticky, as has been the case in the US.\n\nCutting its deposit rate to 3.75 per cent from a record-high 4 per cent, the ECB gave no indication as to whether that would be followed by a further easing in July.\n\n\"We are not pre-comitting to a particular rate path,\" ECB president Christine Lagarde told a Press conference, reading from the Governing Council's statement.\n\n\"Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\"\n\nWith Thursday's move, the ECB joins the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in undoing some of the steepest streaks of interest rate hikes in recent history.\n\nSome ECB-watchers have questioned the logic of moving now, however, especially as the US Federal Reserve has been stopped in its tracks by some stronger-than-expected inflation readings and is not expected to move till after the summer.\n\nMoney market investors trimmed their bets on rate cuts after Thursday's announcement and only priced in one more, with a slight risk of a second, for the remainder of the year.\n\nAsked if the ECB was moving into a phase of \"dialling back\" its tight monetary policy stance, Lagarde said she could not confirm such a process was underway, but that there was \"a strong likelihood\".\n\n\"But it will be data-dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she added.\n\nStronger-than-expected data about euro zone inflation, wages and economic activity over the last few weeks has fuelled fears of a more difficult \"last mile\"

It no longer expects inflation to hit its two-percent target in 2025, as previously expected, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nWhile noting that \"the inflation outlook has improved markedly\", the ECB said in a statement that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year\".\n\nIt reiterated typical language that it would \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to hit its inflation target, and that it would take a \"data-dependent\" approach to is decisions.\n\nDecisions would be based on the inflation outlook, it said, while adding that the rate-setting governing council \"is not pre-committing to a particular rate path\".\n\n- No rapid easing -\n\nThursday's cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nMore from this section US health

ECB\".\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB president Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nThe chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nsr/hmn/lth", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_reeves@reformer.com", "name": "Sam Reeves", "type":

clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs after seeing inflation in the 20 countries that share the euro fall from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above their 2% target in recent months, according to Reuters.\n\nThe broad-based decline was seen as more than enough for the ECB to begin undoing the steepest streak of interest rate hikes in its history, which were a response to spiralling prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow, the ECB will join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates and moving well ahead of the influential US Federal Reserve.\n\nBut what had looked like the start of a major easing cycle only a few weeks ago now appeared more uncertain amid signs that inflation may prove stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThis meant that ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues were unlikely to commit to a further rate reduction at their July meeting or beyond just yet.\n\nInstead, they were expected to stress any further move would depend on incoming data and that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\"The cut will set the new direction for policy but with economic momentum outperforming expectations and domestic inflation proving sticky in 2024, the ECB can afford to take things slowly and let the data set

According to an ECB statement, \"price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" which has enabled the bank to begin easing credit conditions.\n\nHowever, the bank also cautioned that \"wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\" It remained non-committal about the extent or speed of future rate cuts, opting instead to assess the situation on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\n\nDespite the reduction, analysts believe this quarter-point cut may not lead to a rapid succession of further reductions, as the ECB remains cautious, waiting to ensure inflation is firmly under control while simultaneously trying to stimulate the economy.\n\nWhile the annual inflation rate has significantly dropped to 2.6% in May from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decrease has plateaued recently, with a slight increase from 2.4% in April. Inflation within the services sectorwhich spans medical care, haircuts, hotels, restaurants, and entertainmentremains high at 4.1%.\n\nThis shift is a departure from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed led the way in tightening credit by hiking rates from March 2022. This move increased mortgage costs but also enhanced returns for savers with funds in certificates of deposit or money market funds.\n\nThe ECB followed suit four months later. Now, major central banks globally are leaning towards reducing interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies, including Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, have already slashed rates.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are set to meet on June 20, but it remains uncertain whether the governing board will reduce the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic anomaly among the world's large economies, has begun increasing rates after years of sub-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nCentral bank benchmarks significantly impact governments, companies, home buyers, investors and savers. These benchmarks influence borrowing costs across the economy, meaning lower rates could result in reduced mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers.\n\nLower rates can also elevate stock prices and the value of retirement accounts as they decrease returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, potentially leading to stronger economic growth that will enhance corporate earnings.\n\nThe ECB's decision to hike rates has put an end to a nine-year surge in eurozone property prices and hit the construction sector hard, as it relies heavily on borrowing. These higher rates have also increased the initial costs of developing new renewable energy projects, sparking concerns that these costs could hinder Europe's shift from fossil fuels, a key part of the 2015 Paris climate agreements.\n\nThe spike in inflation across Europe was primarily triggered by Russia severing most of its natural gas supplies to the continent, coupled with bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials and parts as the global economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the eurozone felt the brunt of the impact from Russia's gas cut-off first, the subsequent surge in energy prices has now mostly eased, and inflation dropped to 2.6% in May, down from a high of 10.6% in October 2022, aligning closely with the ECB's inflation target of 2%.\n\nAs the central bank wielding the world's primary currency, the actions of the Fed have extensive global repercussions. However, Lagarde emphasized that \"we are data dependent, we are not Fed dependent,\" noting that while the ECB considers global economic conditions, including those in the US, Japan, and China, it bases its decisions on its own analyses.\n\nThe widening interest rate gap between Europe and the US could potentially weaken the euro against the dollar, as more investment money is drawn out of the eurozone into dollar holdings in pursuit of higher returns. This could hinder the ECB's fight against inflation by making imports pricier.\n\nHowever, despite the ECB signalling a rate shift for weeks, the euro has actually strengthened recently - from $1.06 in mid-April to around $1.09 currently. The Federal Reserve is dealing with a different economic landscape, where inflation was less driven by the Russian energy shock and more by government pandemic recovery spending and stronger growth.\n\nThe US consumer price index stands at an annual 3.4%, quite a distance from the Fed's target of 2%. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, has indicated that the bank plans to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, although no change is anticipated at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. As inflation cools slowly in the US, economists and investors are increasingly expecting only one or two cuts this year.\n\nRate hikes help combat inflation by making borrowing to buy goods more expensive, thus reducing demand and easing price pressure. However, high rates can also stifle growth, which has been scarce in the eurozone, where the economy has shown minimal growth recently.\n\nEconomic output growth has been fluctuating slightly above and below zero for over a year, before a modest positive surprise in the first quarter of this year, when the gross domestic product increased by 0.3% from the previous quarter. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, commented on the situation: \"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\".\n\nHe added: \"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

First, the signs are that the pace of cuts from here on may be slow enough, unless the euro zone inflation figures start to head downwards again. The second - and related - point is that there is no going back to the pre-2022 days of a decade of super low interest rates which followed the cut in the key deposit rate to zero in July 2012 in the wake of the financial crash.\n\nRecent history has taught us that financial market expectations of future interest rate trends can change quickly - and dramatically. So it is wise to only read so much into the global change of recent months. But it has been notable. A series of US interest rate cuts had been anticipated this year, but as inflation figures remained stubbornly high and US economic data was stronger than expected, these expectations have changed significantly. This has hit the US stock market, though in the odd world of markets where bad news is good news, there has been a revival in recent days as relatively weak jobs market figures again renewed hopes for interest rate reductions. Still, most forecasters believe that the US Federal Reserve Board - the Fed - will not reduce interest rates until September and are pencilling in just two cuts this year, with some seeing a risk of just one reduction and optimists hanging on for three.\n\nThis US mood has sparked a discussion on whether US and euro zone rates could diverge, but the ECB has indicated that it will be influenced by euro zone data. Despite a rise in euro zone inflation to 2.6 per cent in May from 2.4 per cent in April, the ECB has signalled it is going ahead with a quarter point reduction today. However, the inflation data and some signs of life in the euro zone economy - where wage growth is running at 4.7 per cent and unemployment remains low - have led to traders questioning of how much further interest rates will fall as the year goes on. And this is obviously important for tracker mortgage holders in particular, who have experienced a 4.5 per cent rise in borrowing costs since summer 2022, as the ECB refinancing rate, from which trackers are priced, rose from zero to 4.5 per cent.\n\nSo how much might ECB rates fall this year? Financial markets are now betting on another two reductions after today's. This would still leave the ECB's key deposit rate, currently at 4 per cent, at above the 3 per cent mark by the end of the year. This is important because at this level interest rates are still in what the ECB sees as \"restrictive\" territory - in other words enough to keep a lid on lending and, it hopes, keep inflation on the way down. Were inflation to head gradually down towards the 2 per cent level by the summer of 2025, it would allow interest rates to continue to fall into next year. Were inflation to stay high, however, this outlook could be upset and after a couple of cuts the ECB might have to stay put for a while. Managing these interest rate expectations, which in turn have an impact on the economy, will be important for the ECB as this in turn will affect its fight against inflation.\n\nWhat matters most for mortgage borrowers is where interest rates are in the longer term. And there is one key message to understand. Mortgage rates are not returning to where they were before the recent increases started - barring some major collapse in the euro zone economy. Perhaps some time in the future this may happen. But the rock bottom interest rates of the previous decade came during a period of low euro zone growth and inflation which was below the ECB 2 per cent target level. Now the expectations are for inflation to remain at or above 2 per cent for the foreseeable future. And so interest rates which banks charge will not return to the levels which saw many tracker rates prices at 1 to 1.5 per cent and three to five year fixed rates of 2.5 per cent or less.\n\nThe argument around how far interest rates might fall rests in part on a theoretical argument about the so-called natural level of rates - the level at which they neither stimulate nor restrict economic activity. In turn this natural rate has to take into account the rate of inflation at that particular time - in other words it is expressed as the real, or inflation-adjusted, rate. There is no way to observe what this is exactly and recent estimates for the euro zone range from a natural rate slightly above inflation to one slightly below. In other words, if the ECB were to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target, interest rates might in time fall towards this level, or certainly towards 2.5 per cent, but would only fall lower if the rate of inflation dropped below the 2 per cent target.\n\nSo one possible outcome is that interest rates fall gradually in the months ahead but that the ECB deposit rate only drops below 3 per cent next year. If, say, it fell to around 2.5 per cent, this would imply tracker mortgage rates in the 3.5 to 4 per cent rate range, compared to over 5 per cent now. This remains well above what many tracker holders were used to. However, as their repayments were lower over the years than other mortgage holders and the average outstanding balance is now \u20ac100,000, most of this group are well into their loan and are unlikely to end up in financial difficulties. ECB rates of 2.5 per cent or so also suggest that the better fixed rate offers on the market, now in the 3.5 to 3.75 per cent range, are not bad value, though the remaining fixed rates of over 4.5 per cent on offer from some lenders are poor value in this context.\n\nSo borrowers who took out new mortgages or rolled off fixed rate loans over the past year and decided to go variable or take a one year fixed have benefited as the fixed rates now on offer have improved and some should be cut further.\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris let it be known this week that he would be telling lenders to respond to the ECB cut. This is largely performative as some interest rates have been cut already as the markets anticipated the ECB move and tracker rates will fall automatically. In terms of variable interest rates, most did not increase in tandem with ECB rates - and some have been reduced anyway. It is no harm to keep pressure on the lenders, but as its shareholding in the banks reduces, the Government has less clout in this regard. One place it might direct its fire is towards the nonbank lenders who are managing loans owned by investment funds, where interest rates have remained punishingly high in some cases. Those borrowers with these loans can rightly feel let down by the authorities - who promised them that they would not be disadvantaged. Political and regulatory pressure needs to be kept high here.\n\nIt is also worth remembering that tracker holders will get a \" bonus\" cut of 0.35 of a percentage point in September, due to a restructuring of ECB official interest rates. At the moment there is a half point gap between the main rate - the deposit rate - and the refinancing rate, from which the price of tracker rates is set. The ECB announced that this gap was to be closed to 0.15 of a point for technical reasons; the resulting reduction in the refinancing rate will knock on to lower tracker rates.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/tUsIjNm15kRsEQpffEWd-zU0PsM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/GUGVXBO32Q6C25J3QMEM5EMMBI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 645, "textEnd": 654}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

At the same time, the bank's announcement clarified that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\"\n\nDuring a post-decision press conference, ECB president Christine Lagarde refused to commit to a succession of rate reductions. She instead echoed previous statements that the bank's governing council will follow a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach. \"I think the direction of travel is concrete now, but the pace of cuts might be slower than initially expected,\" says Morningstar strategist Michael Field.\n\nThe ECB's decision comes as expectations faded that the US Federal Reserve would actively cut rates in 2024, thanks to stickier-than-expected inflation in the country. The central bank is instead expected to hold the federal-funds rate at its current range of 5.25%-5.50% until September, when a quarter-point cut is seen as likely, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady,\" the ECB's statement read.\n\nThis is the ECB's first interest rate cut in eight years, and it follows 10 raises since the Frankfurt-based institution began its rate-hiking cycle in July 2022.\n\nAccording to the statement, effective June 12, the interest rates on main refinancing operations, marginal lending facilities, and deposit facilities will each be lowered by 0.25 percentage points.\n\nThe latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation for 2024 and 2025 have been revised up from the March projections. They now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, they project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025, and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025, and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nFor the first time, the ECB acted ahead of its US counterpart to change rates. The cut followed similar moves by other major Western central banks. In March, the Swiss National Bank was the first major bank to announce a rate cut, followed by Sweden's Riksbank in May. Yesterday the Bank of Canada announced it will cut its overnight rate to 4.75% after six consecutive pauses. The Fed will announce its next monetary policy decision on June 12, while the Bank of England will do so on June 20.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Central_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_Riksbank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sveriges Riksbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overnight rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swiss National Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/aARv8X9YsX3su5aSQ8qBCh1-lHE=/1201x676/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/WOOXXPT4RVGWRLVBCTTYLW5XTA.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1836, "textEnd": 1843, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2918, "textEnd": 2925}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It no longer expects inflation to hit its two-percent target in 2025, as previously expected, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nWhile noting that \"the inflation outlook has improved markedly\", the ECB said in a statement that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year\".\n\nIt reiterated typical language that it would \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to hit its inflation target, and that it would take a \"data-dependent\" approach to is decisions.\n\nDecisions would be based on the inflation outlook, it said, while adding that the rate-setting governing council \"is not pre-committing to a particular rate path\".\n\n- No rapid easing -\n\nThursday's cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski said \"sticky inflation will limit the room for additional rate cuts and the ECB's statement also doesn't give away any hints at the future path of the ECB\".\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB president Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nThe chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nsr/hmn/lth\n\nMore from this section\n\nJohn

Rates had been on hold since October, after an unprecedented streak of hikes starting mid-2022 to tame runaway consumer prices.\n\nThe ECB said in a statement that \"price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons,\" allowing it to start loosening credit.\n\nThe question now is how far and how fast the ECB, Federal Reserve and other central bankers will go in lower their benchmarks, with inflation subsiding but not yet back to levels considered best for the economy.\n\nAnalysts say the quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy.\n\nWhile inflation at an annual rate of 2.6% in May is well down from peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months and inflation even ticked up slighly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nMajor central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Bank of England's policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it's not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.\n\nThe inflation surge in Europe was unleashed by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now largely subsided and inflation fell to 2.6% in May, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and within range of the ECB's goal of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces a different economy, one in which government stimulus and pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed's goal, also 2%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 11-12. With inflation cooling slowly in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.\n\nWidening the rate gap between Europe and the U.S. could, in theory, weaken the euro against the dollar by pulling more investment money out of the eurozone and into dollar holdings in search of higher returns. That would hurt the ECB's inflation battle by making imports more expensive.\n\nBut the euro has actually strengthened recently -- from $1.06 in mid-April to its current level around $1.09 -- even though the ECB has telegraphed a rate shift for weeks.\n\nRate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, and that has been in short supply in the eurozone, where the economy has shown very little growth recently.\n\nGrowth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.\n\n\"While it is noteworthy that the ECB is forging well ahead of the U.S. Fed, the transatlantic difference in inflation and growth more than justifies this, in our view,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.\n\n\"If anything, the five quarters of stagnation in the eurozone economy from autumn 2022 to the end of 2023 suggest that the ECB may have overreacted with its rate hikes,\" Schmieding said. \"Seen from this angle, somewhat lower rates make sense.\"\n\nAnalysts say a quarter-point cut on Thursday would likely not usher in a swift series of further cuts as the bank waits to make sure inflation is under control while easing credit to help the economy. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains elevated at 4.1%\n\nCentral bank benchmarks are a big deal both for markets and for ordinary people. They influence borrowing costs across the economy, so lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can increase stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they lower returns on conservative holdings like bank accounts or certificates of deposit relative to stocks, and push investors toward riskier stocks.\n\nIn Germany, the ECB's higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in home prices and slammed construction activity, which is highly sensitive to borrowing costs. Higher rates have also raised the up-front costs for building new renewable energy production as part of Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels and combat climate change under the 2015 Paris climate accords.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

June.\"\n\nThe ECB's tightening campaign began after inflation was driven higher by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pandemic-related supply chain woes, with the bank hiking 10 consecutive times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRapid easing not expected\n\nBut Thursday's cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB President Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nThe central bank will also release its own updated forecasts for growth and inflation on Thursday, which will feed into rate-setters' debate about their next move.\n\nBerenberg bank economist Holger Schmieding expects, however, that the \"ECB will probably provide little clarity on the further outlook for its monetary policy\" and continue to insist that it will respond to incoming data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut given the volatility of recent data, the chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting in mid-June -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@manilatimes.net", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

A cut would be the ECB's first since September 2019, when the deposit facility was in negative territory.\n\nMarkets have only fully priced one further reduction this year, but economists polled by Reuters last week forecast two more cuts taking place over the period.\n\nInvestors will be monitoring the language used in the Governing Council's statement and the tone struck by ECB President Christine Lagarde in her press conference at 2:45 p.m. Frankfurt time.\n\nEspecially important will be the fresh quarterly projections on economic growth and inflation set to be released by ECB staff.\n\nThough the ECB began hiking interest rates later, a June cut would put it ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve on its march lower, as the world's largest central bank remains stymied by the rate of U.S. inflation. Lagarde nevertheless said in her last press conference that ECB officials are \"data-dependent, not Fed-dependent.\"\n\nCanada on Wednesday became the first G7 nation to cut interest rates in the current cycle, while Sweden and Switzerland's central banks already announced their own rate reductions this year.\n\nFormer ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on prospect of rate cuts in Europe\n\nThe European Central Bank is likely to look past recent \"bad news\" on inflation to cut interest rates in June, but may only opt for one more reduction this year, Jean-Claude Trichet, former European Central Bank president, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"My intuition is that they will pull the trigger and decrease rates by point 25 percent, even if there has been some bad news... as regards the goal, which is to stabilize prices and having inflation going down,\" Trichet said.\n\nBad news includes the recent upticks in headline inflation, core inflation and services inflation, and negotiated wages picking up in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe good news is that euro zone unemployment is at an all-time low and purchasing managers' index figures indicate an ongoing economic recovery, he added.\n\n\"We must accept that data could [change] month-on-month or quarter-to-quarter so we must be prudent... based on current data, instead of thinking [the ECB] would decrease [interest rates] twice after June, it is more reasonable to think of one decrease of rates,\" Trichet said.\n\n\"But again this is my central intuition, it can change. We could have a lot of better news as regards inflation and we could have even more bad news,\" he added.\n\n-- Jenni Reid\n\nEuropean Central Bank won't deliver back-to-back rate cuts but has plenty of scope to ease, economist says\n\nAzad Zangana, senior European economist and strategist at Schroders, told CNBC on Tuesday he sees the ECB following through with its June cut, and then opting for reductions at alternate meetings for the rest of the year.\n\nThat would mean a total of three cuts implemented this year, with follow-ups in September and December, in line with the forecast in a recent Reuters poll of economists.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenni_reid@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Jenni Reid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Trichet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Claude Trichet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schroders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/06/107424554-1717602564104-gettyimages-2147051766-GERMANY_ECB.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 527, "textEnd": 541}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

This is the first rate cut of this magnitude since 2012, and nine months after interest rates peaked back in September 2023.\n\nThe rate cut confirms the market's view that the world is quietly moving towards a lower interest rate environment. However, it is not the start of an imminent return to the sub-zero interest rate policy that we know from the years 2014-2022.\n\nThis interest rate cycle is also atypical for the ECB for two reasons: i) They are starting off without the Americans. ii) The rate cut comes at a time when the European economy is improving.\n\nIt's hard to see the ECB moving too far ahead of the Americans, who have yet to start easing interest rates. This is the first time the ECB has really led the way, as they typically follow their American counterparts to avoid increasing the interest rate spread between the two economies. Therefore, we need to get the Americans on board before we really start seeing some aggressive interest rate cuts in Europe.\n\nHowever, US interest rate cuts have been delayed several times. Going into the year, the expectation was that the Americans would get the first interest rate cut in the spring, followed by six more during the year. However, with US inflation stuck at the 3% plus level since last summer, investors have been disappointed to see these rate cuts pushed further into the future. Whether we will see a rate cut from the US Federal Reserve this year is more uncertain. In any case, we shouldn't expect any over the summer, and the market is currently pricing in two starting in the autumn. It's hard to see the ECB being more than one, maybe two, rate cuts ahead of the Americans.\n\nSecondly, the ECB has no experience in cutting interest rates in a recovering economic environment with positive economic growth and record-low unemployment. After 2023 of stagnation and flirtation with a recession on the European continent, recovery is on the way, with the first quarter of the year showing economic growth of a modest but positive 0.3%. Meanwhile, inflation is still above the official 2% target, and European wages are increasing by over 4%.\n\nWhile previous ECB interest rate cuts have typically been drastic in an attempt to give the economy oxygen with favourable interest rates and lower borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, in this cycle, the ECB must maintain the balance between supporting the recovery and avoiding fuelling inflation - it could be a slow-motion interest rate cut cycle.\n\nJakob Westh Christensen, eToro Market Analyst", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

This decrease is primarily due to the return to normalcy in supply and the availability of inexpensive fuel, which has alleviated some of the post-pandemic fluctuations.\n\nNevertheless, the momentum has recently stalled, and warnings that inflation in the euro zone may remain sticky, as it has in the US, have made what appeared to be the beginning of a significant ECB easing cycle only a few weeks ago increasingly uncertain.\n\nNevertheless, it also raised its inflation forecasts for the current year and the subsequent year, underscored the necessity of maintaining borrowing rates at a sufficient level to regulate prices, and emphasized that any further rate reduction would be contingent upon the availability of new data.\n\nDespite recent progress, the European Central Bank reports that wage growth has caused strong domestic price pressures. \"It's likely that inflation will stay above target for the rest of next year.\"\n\nMoney market investors decreased their wagers on rate reductions subsequent to the announcement and have only factored in one for the remainder of the year, with a negligible probability of a second.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde is anticipated to be questioned regarding the cadence of additional easing and whether a rate decrease in July is still feasible during a press conference that commences at 1245 GMT.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) joined the central banks of Switzerland, Canada, and Sweden in reversing some of the harshest rate-hike streaks in recent memory with its action on Thursday.\n\nIt is generally believed that the U.S. Federal Reserve will participate after the summer, as it was halted by some stronger inflation readings earlier this year.\n\nFinal mile\n\nNevertheless, Isabel Schnabel, a prominent board member, has frequently expressed concern about a more difficult \"last mile\" to the ECB's objective, as a result of certain stronger-than-expected data about salaries, inflation, and economic activity in the euro zone over the past few weeks.\n\nThe increase in service inflation has been a particular source of concern, as it is considered particularly significant by some policymakers due to its reflection of domestic demand. This inflation rate rose from 3.7% in April to 4.1% in May.\n\nThis will reduce it to 2.50% at the conclusion of 2025. Nevertheless, they only expect two more reductions this year, in December and September.\n\nFabio Balboni, an economist at HSBC, stated in a note, \"We remain convinced that additional reductions in September and December are imperative.\" In spite of this, if the recent resilience of services inflation persists, it is increasingly likely that the ECB will have to be more cautious on the way down.\n\nFurthermore, the ECB's urgency was diminished by rebounding economic growth, which disproved the claim that high interest rates are suffocating the economy.\n\nBut the real elephant in the room may be the Federal Reserve and its inception or extension of its own easing program.\n\nAs a result of a tighter Federal Reserve, the euro would likely decline and import inflation would increase for the currency bloc. However, it would also raise bond market yields globally, resulting in a double-edged weapon with an unpredictable impact on the overall economy.\n\nAccording to Mohit Kumar, an analyst at Jefferies, the Federal Reserve and the United States will determine the rate of rate reduction. If the Fed does not cut rates at all this year, we could see only two reductions from the ECB.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salman_ahmad@chiangraitimes.com", "name": "Salman Ahmad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HSBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ECB.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

What about the Bank of England? With Central Bankers always having a keen eye on divergence, today's decision, following a cut by the Bank of Canada yesterday, will give food for thought. And what does it mean for investment decisions and asset allocation?\n\nInvestment and economics experts have been commenting on today's ECB interest news as follows:\n\nHelen Vieira, Head of Banks at Flagstone International comments on the ECB's decision to cut interest rates:\n\n\"The ECB decision to trim interest rates to 3.75% signals its belief that we have reached the summit of inflation and that we are now descending towards a new normal. The rate has sat at 4% since September 2023 in order to curb inflation. However, concerns have been growing that has left the Eurozone economy labouring uphill and in danger of losing ground.\n\nThis move is designed to foster greater economic stability and growth. While that may bring a sense of relief among central bankers, for businesses and householders across the Eurozone that will be tempered with some trepidation.\n\n\"As any good mountaineer will tell you, its no good reaching the summit of a mountain if you don't descend safely. That is the challenge now facing all the G7 central bankers. How can they guide their respective economies to a level that keeps inflation in check, provides relief to beleaguered households and stimulates economic growth sufficiently?.\n\n\"The ECB has followed Canada's first steps earlier this week in deciding it was time to start trimming rates and the expectation is the US and the UK will join that journey by the end of this year. However, each will move at its own pace.\n\n\"For those managing cash deposits that means we may see rates offered on cash start to tick down across many jurisdictions. That it makes it even more important to stay aware, and ready, to take advantage of the best returns across the world.\"\n\nBen Nichols, Interim Managing Director of RAW Capital Partners, said: \"The ECB's decision will resonate with consumers and investors not just in the EU, but globally. While the impact of the cut is unlikely to be felt immediately, the move adds to the growing feeling that the global economy has turned a corner, and should provide some impetus to the Eurozone's business investment, consumer spending and housing markets. We could also see investor sentiment experience something of an uptick in the aftermath of this decision, which could instigate a pick-up in global trade and investment.\n\n\"However, the risk remains that the ECB is cutting rates too early, and it will be intriguing to see if the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England follow suit in the coming months. The outlook for energy prices is unreliable and geopolitical conflict in Europe and the Middle East could create major challenges further down the line. What's more, the Eurozone's labour market remains surprisingly strong. Therefore, a rekindling of inflationary pressures remains a significant risk factor if the bank cuts rates too quickly.\n\n\"As a result, investors must watch on with keen interest. The challenge remains ensuring that portfolios can withstand any turbulence that arises from central banks' interest rates decisions by diversifying across a range of uncorrelated asset classes, territories and sectors. This includes building a portfolio of both traditional and alternative investments, which will help reduce volatility, provide down-side protection, and protect recent gains.\"\n\nDaniele Antonucci, Chief Investment Officer at Quintet Private Bank (parent of Brown Shipley), commenting on the on ECB interest rate cut said:\n\n\"That the European Central Bank cut interest rates today isn't a surprise. After all, this was widely pre-announced by the central bankers. The latest inflation figures caused the market to doubt somewhat that the inflation-easing trend had continued, perhaps the European Central Bank's ability to cut rates.\n\n\"However, we doubt this is the case. Our view is that the inflation progress is just slowing. One of our 2024 outlook views was that inflation would slow to just above central banks' targets. This is what's happening in the Eurozone. The key piece of information for markets is what President Lagarde will say on the future rate path at the press conference. Any upcoming ECB rate cuts are likely to be a tailwind for consumption and investment and, therefore, economic growth.\n\n\"This is one reason why we've recently added to European equities to our tactical asset allocation, given the better growth prospects.\n\n\"Beyond today's cut, the pace of rate reduction remains quite uncertain and investors will be on the lookout for any clues from the central bank. Our view is that the European Central Bank should be able to lower rates a couple of extra times this year, though likely not at each upcoming 2024 meeting. Rapid rate reductions seem unlikely, though, even if the domestic economy were weaker and inflation slightly lower. This is because inflation looks sticky in the US, which suggests that the European Central Bank may refrain from cutting too much if the Fed doesn't for a while longer.\n\n\" If the Eurozone saw significantly lower rates versus the US, the euro would risk depreciating versus the US dollar, as exchange rates tend to be driven by interest rate differentials in the near term.", "source": {"uri":

Additionally, ECB chief Christine Lagarde noted that achieving the 2% inflation goal will happen later than thought.\n\n\"Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year,\" she told reporters in Frankfurt. \"It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next year.\"\n\nECB's decision comes soon after the Bank of Canada also cut rates by 25 basis points.\n\nWill these decisions force the Federal Reserve to cut earlier than expected? The futures market is still penciling in a Fed rate cut beginning in September or November.\n\nIn economic data, Europe's producer prices fell 1% monthly, higher than the consensus estimate of -0.5%. Retail sales tumbled at a worse-than-expected pace of 0.5%. The next major data point will be the first quarter GDP, which could confirm if the bloc is in a recession.\n\nMeanwhile, the EUR/USD currency pair rose 0.15% to 1.0886, from an opening of 1.0871, at 13:34 GMT on Thursday.

However, she may offer some clues about how concerned policymakers are by the stickiness of wage and services inflation.\"\n\n1.58am: SpaceX Starship launch successful... so far\n\nThe super-massive SpaceX giant Starship has successfully launched on its fourth test flight, with its Super Heavy booster having achieved a 'soft splashdown' as planned.\n\nThe Starship spaceship has entered space, as its predecessor did in the third flight though it was unable to be returned to Earth.\n\n1.40pm: ECB forecasts hit bonds\n\nEuropean bond movements suggest the ECB move, or maybe just the inflation forecasts, were not fully priced in by markets.\n\nBond yields have risen and UK, German and French stock indices are heading lower.\n\nMeanwhile, US weekly jobless claims are in.\n\nThe initial reading for the week ending last Saturday that claims rose to a four-week high of 229k, above the 220k expected and the prior week's 219k.\n\nContinued jobless claims were also up, to 1.792 million from 1.791 million, beating the 1.790 million expected.\n\n1.29pm: Inflation is down but not out, forecasts hiked\n\nThe ECB governing council said it decided to lower the three key interest rates as the time was right, due to the fall in inflation by more than 2.5 percentage points since its September meeting.\n\n\"Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.\"\n\nThe inflation outlook has also \"improved markedly\", the council felt, with underlying inflation having also eased, \"reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons\".\n\nMonetary policy has dampened demand and kept inflation expectations \"well anchored,\" the council said, helping bringing inflation back down, though domestic price pressures remain strong from elevated wage growth.\n\nThe next move from the ECB was not clear, as the governing council expects inflation to stay above target \"well into next year\", with latest staff projections for revised up for 2024 and 2025.\n\nHeadline CPI inflation is now forecast to average 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, with core inflation, which excludes energy and food, seen at 2.8% in 2024, falling to 2.2% in 2025.\n\nEconomic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024 and 1.4% in 2025.\n\n1.16pm: The ECB cuts\n\nThe ECB cuts rates as expected.\n\nIt repeats an intention to keep rates restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve its aims and repeats its data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach.\n\n1.04pm: Royal Mail short bet\n\nJust a few minutes until the ECB decision is confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, we've reports that Royal Mail's parent company, International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS), is being shorted by a New York hedge fund.\n\nThis could be a bet on the collapse of the postal service group's \u00a33.6 billion takeover from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\n\nSessa Capital initially reported it had opened a 0.73% net short position with IDS last Friday, just days after the board recommended the offer.\n\nEarlier this week, the investment group upped its position to 0.83%, with analysts labelling the move \"bold\" but \"intriguing\".\n\n12.59pm: More election tax sparring\n\nTory MP Laura Trott has accused Labour of \"asking for a blank cheque\" to raise taxes across the board this election.\n\nNot so, shadow defence secretary John Healey told Sky News this morning. \"The taxes that are most important to people - income tax, VAT and National Insurance - will not be raised under a Labour government.\"\n\nBut there is one field where promises are no so crystal clear: capital gains tax (CGT).\n\nAccording to courses cited by The Guardian, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is under pressure from colleagues to commit to CGT increases, should she be the one to deliver the autumn budget...read more here.\n\n12.47pm: Starship rocket's fourth flight test this afternoon\n\nStarship, the giant rocket made by Elon Musk's SpaceX, is scheduled to blast off on its fourth flight test later today.\n\nWith the launch taking place at the company's Boca Raton base on the Texas coast, the target time is 7.50am Central Time, which is 1.50pm London time.\n\nIt follows significant progress made on the previous test for the 120-metre tall rocket, which reached space but it did not successfully make it back to Earth in one piece.\n\n12.31pm: Swifties' economic sparks fly\n\nBig news for financial publications, which don't get to write about pop stars much: Taylor Swift this week is kicking off the UK leg of her Eras tour, with a string of concerts which are expected to generate \u00a31 billion for the British economy.\n\nFresh from her The Tortured Poets Department album release, Swift will get her tour of Britain underway at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with her frankly crazy levels of popularity expected to lead to road closures, record attendances and a horde of frenzied merchandise and other spending.\n\nSome 220,000 fans are forecast to attend the three Edinburgh performances, with the local council warning that roads and areas near the arena would be disrupted - read more here if you like.\n\n12.12pm: Markets tiptoeing higher\n\nTrading in London shares remains positive at just after midday, tiptoeing higher ahead of the ECB meeting.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index up almost 35 points or 0.4%, while the FTSE 250 is up 65 points or 0.3%.\n\nTop riser across both indices is John Wood Group PLC (LSE:WG.), up almost 10% after its board decided to engage in takeover talks with Sidara.\n\nThis followed a fourth possible offer from the Dubai-based rival at a \"final price\" of 230p per share in cash.\n\nWood's board said that while it \"remains confident\" in the current strategy and prospects, \"having now weighed all relevant factors including, in particular, feedback received from Wood shareholders, the board has decided to engage with Sidara to determine if a firm offer can be made\".\n\nSidara is being given access to the books to carry out due diligence and the put-up-or-shut-up (PUSU) deadline has been extended to 5pm on 3 July.\n\nThe biggest faller is Vodafone, down as its shares go ex-dividend, along with several others.\n\n12.05pm: ECB 'should not cut rates'\n\nThe ECB should not cut rates, reckons Alberto Matell\u00e1n, chief economist at Mapfre.\n\nEconomic data does not support a rate cut, as the \"persistence of inflation, together with the improvement in growth data we've seen in recent quarters, means that the lowering of rates in Europe isn't justified,\" he says.\n\n\"The macro situation in Europe doesn't justify rate cuts, certainly not a cycle of them. We have growth, weak as it is, and it's beginning to improve. There are other nuances, such as financial stability, but looking at the macro data, this isn't justified.\"\n\nAs other economists have said, what comes after this first small cut is almost more important, as one quarter-point reduction won't move the economic dial much, and as Matellan suggests, a big move is not warranted.\n\nComments at the meeting might give a clue.\n\n11.56am: White House Gaza statement\n\nThe White House has issued a joint statement from the leaders of the US, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada and others on Gaza, calling on Hamas to move towards a ceasefire and hostage-release deal.\n\n\"As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement says.\n\n\"There is no time to lose. We call on Hamas to close this agreement, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and begin the process of releasing our citizens.\n\n\"We note that this agreement would lead to an immediate ceasefire and rehabilitation of Gaza together with security assurances for Israelis, and Palestinians, and opportunities for a more enduring long-term peace and a two-state solution.\"\n\nThe price of gold, which has risen from $1800 per oz before the Hamas attack in October to $2400 is little moved today at $2360.\n\nOil prices, which have been up and down in that period, are up slightly today, with Brent crude futures rising 0.36% to $78.69 a barrel.\n\n11.50am: Blackout risk lessens, green investment increases\n\nAhead of the ECB announcement, most European markets are moving largely sideways after initially starting higher, including the Footsie.\n\nMeanwhile, National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) has published its outlook report, showing reduced risks of blackouts this winter, with a 9.4% margin between expected capacity and demand, up from 7.4% last winter.\n\n\"Rebalancing in European energy markets has further reduced the risk of fuel shortages for gas generation in Great Britain and increased the resilience of interconnector imports to supply-side shocks,\" the ESO said.\n\nElsewhere in the energy market, the International Energy Agency has forecast that worldwide investment into low-carbon energy is expected to be double that of fossil fuel power, having overtaken climate-damaging energy for the first time last year.\n\nA spike in solar project spending is expected to be the main engine of growth, as $2 trillion of cash is beamed into clean energy, which includes sectors such as renewables, nuclear power, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy storage.\n\n11.23am: Shein push-back from fund managers\n\nUK fund managers have expressed concerns about supporting fashion company Shein's potential flotation in London due to allegations about its treatment of workers, according to a report this morning from the Financial Times.\n\nRecent indications have suggested the $66 billion Chinese online fashion company is seeking to list in London after getting pushback in the US from its hoped-for IPO in New York.\n\nWhile a London IPO could potentially help revive a dormant market in the Square Mile, leading UK institutional investors are hesitant to invest due to allegations of forced labour in Shein's cotton supply from Xinjiang. Shein has denied these claims.\n\n\"It's a tricky one,\" one UK fund manager told the paper. \"I don't think anyone with an ESG team will be able to buy it. It smacks of desperation for the London Stock Exchange -- they'll take anything.\" He added that there is a risk of \"collateral brand damage\" for the LSE.\n\nA Shein spokesperson stated the company has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and is committed to respecting human rights.\n\n11.10am: Super-rich pack up to avoid election tax hikes\n\nBloomberg is reporting that wealthy UK residents, including foreign billionaires and City bankers, are \"rushing to shelter their money\" following Rishi Sunak's snap election call.\n\nSome are cashing in investments, paying off bills that may soon rise or leaving the UK entirely, the report suggests, having interviewed over 20 high-net-worth individuals and wealth advisers.\n\n10.55am: UK publishers' Google trial to proceed\n\nAn interesting story I missed yesterday, a potential \u00a313 billion-plus claim by UK publishers against Google over its \"anti-competitive\" advertising technology has been permitted to move to trial.\n\nThe claim alleges that Google abused its dominant position in the adtech market, causing billion of pounds of losses for UK publishers.\n\nLondon's Competition Appeal Tribunal yesterday certified the claim to allow it to go to trial, dismissing Google's arguments - thats via the Press Gazzette.\n\n10.49am: ECB preview\n\nThe European Central Bank decision is due just after 1pm today.\n\nHere are the thoughts of a couple of economists (read more here).\n\nAfter the Bank of Canada followed recent moves by the Swiss National Bank and Sweden's Riksbank in making the first interest rate cuts since the pandemic, Simon French at Panmure Gordon says Ottowa has made it easier for its European counterparts.\n\n\"Moving as a herd is an attractive feature for central bankers privately worried about being labelled the Jean-Claude Trichet of this economic cycle.\n\n\"The BoC has just made that task easier for its European counterparts,\" says French.\n\nFrancesco Pesole at ING says with a cut almost guaranteed and fully priced in by markets, the attention will be on communication.\n\nAnd while there are risks for the euro, he doubts this will be a huge event for FX.\n\n\"Unless President Lagarde revamps some of her eloquence (she has seemingly made press conferences intentionally uneventful), then the FX market may be left with more questions than answers.\"\n\nThere's also a meeting later in the day at Denmark's central bank, whose mandate is to keep stability in the EUR/DKK exchange rate, so it will likely cut rates by the same 25 bps a few hours after the ECB.\n\n10.35am: Sunak claim investigated\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has launched an investigation into a statement by Rishi Sunak that the economy is \"going gangbusters\" and that parties could misuse economic data in election campaigning.\n\nRobert Chote, chair of the statistics watchdog, said the body will scrutinise whether the prime minister's comments exaggerated the Tory's economic performance.\n\nSunak used the \"going gangbusters\" phrase after it had been used by an ONS official in a media briefing, making the Daily Mail front page.\n\nUK GDP growth was 0.6% in the first three months of the year, following a shallow recession in the second half of last year, with a decline of 0.3% in the fourth quarter after a 0.1% fall in the third.\n\n10.22am: EU retail sales\n\nEurope retail sales were down 0.5% month-on-month in April, worse than the 0.2% expected decline and after an increase of 0.7% the month before.\n\nCompared to the previous year, sales were flat, which again was lower than an expected 0.1% rise, easing from the previous month's 0.7% growth.\n\n10.05am: UK shares tick higher\n\nMomentum is positive in the FTSE 100 index, with all but three of the top 20 largest stocks in green this morning.\n\nBut with ex-divs holding the index back a little, the gain is small, up 0.2% so far, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.4%.\n\nA Nvidia-led storming run for the Nasdaq last night and the prospect of interest rate cuts in Europe today \"have all combined to put investors in a good mood,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, saying we're now \"beginning the next phase in the cycle\".\n\n\"The ECB is expected to follow the likes of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland by cutting rates later today, bringing the long-awaited pivot in monetary policy and signalling the start of a new era.\n\n\"After a long period of rock-bottom rates, the subsequent period shocked markets to the core as interest rates soared amid high levels of inflation.\n\n\"We're now beginning the next phase in the cycle where inflationary pressures ease and central banks move to a new playbook to help prop up a flagging economy and make life easier for consumers and businesses who have had to stomach sky-high borrowing costs.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve meeting comes next week (and Bank of England the week after), and while they might have given the impression they aren't swayed by what the ECB and other countries do, \"the greater the number of central banks cutting, the more pressure they will be under to do the same\", says Mould.\n\nOn the FTSE's top riser, Antofagasta and its deal to improve the water supply at a copper project in Chile, Mould says: \"Mining is a risky industry and anything a company can do to lower the risks is a positive for investors. Ensuring a smooth supply of water is important, particularly when a mine is in a remote or difficult to access location.\"\n\n9.41am: Construction survey beats consensus\n\nA couple of bits of macro data have just come out.\n\nThe UK construction PMI for May came in stronger than forecast at 54.7, up from 53.0 a month earlier and beating the 52.5 consensus estimate.\n\nThe Bank of England's monthly decision maker panel (DMP) survey for May finds UK businesses see year-ahead CPI at 2.9%, flat from the last count.\n\nThey also see output price inflation easing to 3.9% from 4.0% while businesses see year-ahead output wage growth easing to 4.5% from 4.8%.\n\nThe DMP survey gathers views from chief financial officers from large, medium and small businesses, which the BoE says it uses to monitor developments in the economy and to track businesses' views.\n\n9.09am: Big UK automotive order for US autonomous vehicles\n\nShares in Strip Tinning (AIM:STG), a maker of automotive components, had revved up more than 60% earlier after a large German auto group selected it for a \"major high volume strategic nomination\" for autonomous vehicles being developed by a huge US company.\n\nIt described the client as a \"leading German automotive motion technology Tier 1 manufacturer\", while the contract nomination is for the supply of cell contact systems for the battery pack modules.\n\nThe vehicle manufacturer is said by the AIM-listed company to be \"owned by one of the world's largest corporations and is currently running trials on public roads in three US cities\".\n\nThis seems to point to Waymo, owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google's parent company.\n\n8.52am: N Brown back in the black\n\nIt's a pretty quiet day in terms of blue-chip corporate results, but there's some mid-cap numbers out, including from Jacamo and SimplyBe owner N Brown Group PLC (AIM:BWNG), where the shares are up 20%.\n\nThe finals results from the struggling home shopping group N Brown are \"nothing to shout about\", says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, with total revenue down 10%.\n\nBut adjusted EBITDA, while nearly 13% down, are above market expectations and that the company has returned to statutory profits.\n\nCEO Steve Johnson trumpets that \"we have delivered against our strategic and financial objectives this year\", while also saying that in current trading, the rate product revenue decline \"has moderated\", with Q1 declining by 6% and \"this improvement is expected to continue as the year progresses\".\n\n8.44am: European markets up ahead of ECB decision\n\nAhead of the ECB meeting later, the FTSE's small gain is being eclipsed by those on the European mainland, with the ex-dividend stocks weighing on the UK market.\n\nThe FTSE 250 is up 66 points at 20,730.\n\nIn Europe, the DAX is leading with a 0.81% rise, France's CAC 40 up 0.40%, Spain's Ibex 0.37% and Italy's FTSE MIB ahead 0.24%. The wider Stoxx 600 has risen 0.58%.\n\n8.33am: Can anything stop Nvidia?\n\nA stunning fact is that, in just two years, Nvidia's market cap has increased more than 600%, with the chipmaker's valuation rocket past Netflix, past Tesla, past Google, Broadcom, Amazon and Meta, to also overtake Apple in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs of this moment, Nvidia is valued at $3.01 trillion versus Apple's measly $3 trillion.\n\nThe gap is expected to widen even further when US markets open today, with pre-market trades pointing to a 0.95% gain on Nvidia stock and a 0.17% loss on Apple stock, writes my colleague Billy Farrington as he takes a look at the meteoric rise of the semiconductor innovator.\n\n8.27am: Modestly positive market sentiment\n\nPositive stock market sentiment has been rekindled after an erratic May, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nInvestors will remain on \"high alert\" for further economic developments unfolding, he adds.\n\nIn the year to date, the FTSE 100 is up 6.7%, Nasdaq is ahead by 14.5% and the S&P 500 by 12.2%, Germany's Dax has risen around 11.6% and Japan's Nikkei jumped 16.3%.\n\nFocusing on this morning, Hunter says: \"The London market edged higher at the open, with tentative buying interest in the mining sector offsetting some of the more recent weakness across oil and commodity prices in general.\n\n\"Such weakness has tempered gains in the FTSE 100 after a record-breaking level was reached in May ... and despite the uncertainty of an imminent general election, the more domestically focused FTSE 250 has reversed early year losses to stand up by 5.3% in the year to date, latterly propelled by a UK economy which is seeing some benefit from easing inflation and the possibility of lower interest rates, in addition to recently having left a short and shallow technical recession.\"\n\nHe says the appetite for tech stocks is also driving many global indices higher.\n\n\"The likelihood of an interest rate cut later today from the ECB also boosted sentiment, potentially signalling a new era of easier monetary conditions across the globe,\" Hunter adds.\n\n8.16am: FTSE reshuffle confirmed\n\nIn the UK, the FTSE index reshuffle was confirmed last night, involving three demotions from the blue-chip index, with LondonMetric Property, Vistry Group and Darktrace (temporarily as it is being taken over) replacing Ocado, RS Group and St James's Place.\n\nDropping out of the FTSE 250 into the small caps will be Ferrexpo, Mobico Group (National Express) and Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust, replaced by Alpha Group International, Renewi and XPS Pensions Group.\n\n8.08am: FTSE starts higher, ex-divs weigh\n\nThe FTSE 100 is ambling higher, as predicted, rising 12 points or 0.15% to 8259 in the first few minutes of trading.\n\nTop risers initially are copper miner Antofagasta, up 2.5% after a deal to improve the water supply at a copper project in Chile, and precious metals miner Fresnillo, though it's not immediately clear why.\n\nBurberry and Rolls-Royce are next.\n\nVodafone is the big faller, down 5.8% after going ex-dividend.\n\nOther ex-div fallers include WPP, Informa, Sainsbury and National Grid.\n\n7.56am: More weak data from Germany\n\nAfter recent data showed German inflation and unemployment claims increasing, this morning we hear that factory orders in Germany fell by 0.2% month-to-month in April, below the consensus for a 0.6% increase after a revised 0.8% decline in March.\n\nThe year-over-year rate improved to -1.6%. Net revisions to the month-to-month data were down 0.4%.\n\n\"This was a good deal weaker than we expected,\" says economist Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics, but the headline number was held back by a big fall in major orders that masks a 2.9% jump in core orders, which is more in line with forecasts.\n\n7.49am: Regulator calls for scrutiny of AI sector\n\nIn a big tech story after the barnstorming Nvidia performance last night, there are reports that a major US investigation is brewing into the three major players in AI.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal that allows them to proceed with antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia are playing in the industry.\n\nThe two regulators have reached a deal to split responsibility for investigating the three major players in AI.\n\nUS antitrust watchdog also says \"urgent scrutiny\" is needed over big tech's control of AI, according to a Financial Times story, where Department of Justice chief Jonathan Kanter says he is examining \"monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape\" in AI, covering aspects from computing power and data utilised for training large language models to cloud service providers, engineering talent, and essential hardware like graphics processing unit chips.\n\nRegulators must act \"with urgency\" to prevent dominant tech companies from monopolising the market, he says, though he suggests a \"real time\" intervention can be \"less invasive\" for industries.\n\n7.31am: Fever-Tree mixes top line gains with market growth\n\nFevertree Drinks (AIM:FEVR) said it remained \"comfortable with full year expectations\", reporting market share gains and topline growth.\n\nAhead of its AGM, the company issued a statement to say that it anticipates a strong summer trading period with new marketing initiatives.\n\nIn the UK, Fever-Tree has solidified its leading position, especially in the rum, vodka and cocktail mixer categories, while in the US it boasted that its products continue to be \"the biggest contributor to growth within the carbonated mixer category\", while also growing ahead of the market in Europe.\n\n7.14am: Positive start expected for FTSE 100\n\nThe FTSE 100 is expected to hit the ground jogging on Thursday, after a strong finish on Wall Street overnight and ahead of the European Central Bank meeting later today.\n\nSpread-betters have tipped the London benchmark to add 15 points this morning, adding to the 15 it made yesterday to finish at 8,246.95.\n\nLast night Nvidia rocketed 5% to a new record higher, leading a tech melt-up, as the Nasdaq Composite index surged 1.95% and the S&P 500 jumped 1.18%, with the Dow Jones rising a more humdrum 0.25%.\n\nNvidia's continued ascent, up 154% this year, meant it topped a $3 trillion market cap and overtook Apple to become the second largest company in the world by market valuation.\n\nDriving the mood yesterday were various factors, including weak ADP data and Canada's central bank cutting rates.\n\nLower yields boosted appetite in global indices, said market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank. \"The Canadian TSX rebounded past its 50-DMA, the European SXXP jumped while the S&P 500 was catapulted to a fresh record for the 25th time this year.\n\n\"Yes the S&P 500 renewed record 25 times since this year started - regardless of the fact that we spent most of the year scaling back the Fed cut bets and are still not sure if the Fed will be able to cut rates this year at all.\"\n\nYesterday Goldman Sachs predicted a \"wall of money\" from passive equity allocations will pour into the stock market in early July, setting up a rally through the early summer.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_haill@proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "name":

Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\"\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, the ECB noted that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\"\n\nTranslation: goodbye 2% inflation target.\n\nFinally, in conclusion for those expecting guidance about more rate cuts, this is how the ECB previewed its next actions:\n\nThe Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nAlso of note, here are the ECB's new economic projections:", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-06/ECB%20deposit%20rate.jpg?itok=4YF4FDDk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs, encouraging both consumer spending and business investment. This increased liquidity can boost investments in higher-yielding assets, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, lower returns on traditional savings can drive investors toward riskier assets like crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the rate cuts might lead to higher prices for crypto. With safer investments offering lower returns, investors often seek higher returns in the crypto market. This shift can increase demand for digital assets, potentially driving up their value.\n\nRead more: 11 Cryptos To Add To Your Portfolio Before Altcoin Season\n\nHowever, the moves by the ECB and BoC come with caution.

This move has long been telegraphed to markets,\" said Frederik Ducrozet, chief economist at Pictet Wealth Management.\n\n\"The focus will now shift to what is going to happen after June.\"\n\nThe ECB's tightening campaign began after inflation was driven higher by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pandemic-related supply chain woes, with the bank hiking 10 consecutive times.\n\n- Rapid easing not expected -\n\nBut Thursday's expected cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nMore from this section The scars of D-Day 80 years later Mostly cloudy, humid in New Jersey; thunderstorms arrive tonight into Thursday Prince Andrew was 'not invited' to famous Beckham wedding, Levin claims\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB president Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nThe central bank will also release its own updated forecasts for growth and inflation on Thursday, which will feed into rate-setters' debate about their next move.\n\nBerenberg bank economist Holger Schmieding expects, however, that the \"ECB will probably provide little clarity on the further outlook for its monetary policy\", and continue to insist that it will respond to incoming data.\n\nBut given the volatility of recent data, the chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting in mid-June -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nsr/hmn/lth/dhw", "source": {"uri":

With a rate cut effectively guaranteed (absent some shock) focus will be on hints over future rate cuts, with markets not fully pricing in another move until December. Changes to staff projections are likely to be minimal. In their preview, Bank of America strategists agree that a 25bps rate cut is coming, and expect \"a lot more to come by mid-2025.\" That said, guidance for a meeting-by-meeting approach and data dependence probably won't change. Small forecast revisions higher to 2024/25 are likely, but 2% core inflation in 2026 should stay, providing a soft signal to a September cut, data permitting.\n\nIn rates markets, a cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday is already fully baked into the curve, with forward pricing nearly 25bp. But as ING Economics notes, it's the outlook beyond June that is still open, despite communication from officials having started to move out the curve. A back-to-back cut in July is deemed unlikely, with markets attaching only a roughly 10% chance to that scenario. A second cut is almost fully priced by October, but it's a third cut this year that is hanging in the balance. The pricing further out the curve is also influenced by drivers from abroad: weaker US data as well as sliding oil prices have also helped push rates lower in the eurozone. While EUR markets have been leaning towards a three-cut scenario for this year again, the domestic data on negotiated wages and the latest CPI print over the past weeks would argue for a more hawkish line at the upcoming meeting.\n\nTherefore, there is room for markets to reprice higher - but in the end, they will oscillate around the two or three-cuts scenario for now unless we get more evidence from the data. This will also spill out into the longer end of the curve, but here the factors from abroad should be felt even more with the US jobs data looming large. This will then determine whether we can get above 2.6% more lastingly in the 10Y Bund yield on a hawkish ECB.\n\nCourtesy of Newsquawk, here are some other key considerations ahead of the ECB's first rate cut in five years:\n\nPRIOR MEETING: As expected, the ECB opted to stand pat on rates once again. The policy statement reaffirmed guidance that rates will be kept sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long. Furthermore, policymakers will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach and will not pre-commit to a particular rate path. That being said, and what was a new inclusion for the statement, it was noted that if the Governing Council was to gain further confidence that inflation is converging to the target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In the follow-up press conference, when questioned about a potential rate cut in June, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB will have a lot more data by the time of the June meeting. In terms of the unanimity of the announcement, Lagarde stated that \"a few\" dissenters felt \"sufficiently confident\" about altering policy at the meeting, however, they ultimately rallied around the consensus. This could potentially be in-fitting with source reporting in the wake of the previous meeting which suggested some policymakers floated the idea of a second cut in July to win over a small group still pushing for an April start.\n\nRECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: In terms of developments since the prior meeting, inflation in May rose to 2.6% from 2.4% with the super-core measure increasing to 2.9% from 2.7% with some of the increases related to base effects. The ECB's consumer expectations survey for April saw the 12-month inflation forecast nudge lower to 2.9% from 3.0%. For market gauges, the 5y5y forward has ticked marginally higher from 2.35% to 2.36%. Elsewhere, Q1 Eurozone wages rose to 4.69% from 4.45% with the release followed up by an ECB blog stating that \"wage growth reflects multiyear adjustment and wage pressures look set to decelerate in 2024\". From a growth perspective, Q1 GDP came in at 0.3% Q/Q vs. prev. 0.0%, whilst more timely survey data showed the EZ-composite PMI moved further into expansionary territory (52.3 vs. prev. 51.7) thanks to a pick up in the manufacturing sector. The accompanying report noted \"considering the PMI numbers in our GDP nowcast, the Eurozone will probably grow at a rate of 0.3% during the second quarter, putting aside the spectre of recession\". Elsewhere, the EZ unemployment rate sits at a historic low of 6.4%.\n\nRECENT COMMUNICATIONS: Rhetoric since the April meeting has seen President Lagarde remark that the ECB will cut rates soon, barring any major surprises, whilst she is \"really confident\" that they have inflation under control. Chief Economist Lane noted that keeping rates overly restrictive for too long could push inflation below target in the medium-term which would require corrective action. Furthermore, he notes that the ECB thinks inflation over the coming months will bounce around at the current level and then will see another phase of disinflation bringing them back to the target later next year. Thought-leader Schnabel of Germany remarked that some elements of inflation are proving persistent and would caution against moving too fast on rates. At the hawkish end of the spectrum, Austria's Holzmann has tried to make the case for pausing the July meeting, whilst Netherland's Knot has stated that projection round meetings will be the key for interest rate decisions. For the doves, Italy's Panetta commented that the ECB must weigh risk of monetary policy becoming too tight, adding that timely and small rate cuts would counter weak demand, whilst Greece's Stournaras is of the view that three rate cuts are more likely this year.\n\nRATES: Expectations are for the ECB to lower the deposit rate for the first time since September 2019. Analysts are unanimous in their view that the deposit rate will be lowered from 4.0% to 3.75% with markets assigning a roughly 94% chance of such an outcome. With a 25bps cut so widely expected, the fight on the GC between the hawks and doves will be what comes thereafter with the former likely to make the case for pausing on rates in July given potential emerging upside risks to inflation, whilst the latter is set to argue that keeping policy too tight could push inflation below target. As such, any tweaks to the policy statement, hinting at further action will be of note to the market. Accordingly, focus for the release will be on how pricing beyond June evolves with the next rate cut thereafter not fully priced until December (total of 56bps of cuts seen by year-end). However, ING cautions that given the data dependency of the Bank, this debate is unlikely to be resolved in June.\n\nMACRO PROJECTIONS: For the accompanying macro projections, ING notes that since the prior forecast round in March, oil prices have risen (from roughly USD 75/bbl at the time), which would be pro-inflationary. However, offsetting this, is the more hawkish market curve which sees around 113bps of cuts by the end of 2025 vs. around 150bps in March. Overall, the bank expects \"a slight upward revision of growth and inflation for this year but no changes to the profile and the timing of inflation dropping below 2%\". That being said, economists at the Bank note \"the risks of inflation remaining sticky and not being entirely under control are increasing\".\n\nFinally, courtesy of ING, here is a scenario analysis

Officials led by President Christine Lagarde lowered the key deposit rate by a quarter-point to 3.75 per cent on Thursday, as expected. Having kept it at four per cent for nine months, they said the inflation outlook has improved \"markedly,\" though they also raised projections for prices.\n\n\"The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nThe decision begins to roll back the unprecedented barrage of hikes deployed to quell the euro zone's worst-ever spike in prices. The step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nWhile Lagarde last month declared inflation \"under control,\" a string of recent data has pointed to enduring price pressures. That's prompted investors and economists to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024 to two or three in total.\n\nMoney markets held onto bets that the next cut will probably be in September. The euro rose 0.1 per cent to $1.0880 and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55 per cent.\n\nAn updated quarterly outlook published alongside the ECB's policy statement forecasts inflation averaging 2.2 per cent in 2025, with this year's projection for economic expansion lifted to 0.9 per cent from 0.6 per cent before.\n\nLagarde will hold a news conference at 2:45 p.m. in Frankfurt to elaborate on the ECB's decisions. The run-up to Thursday's meeting saw policymakers leave little room for doubt in their intention to lower rates -- even after some of the economic numbers they'd hoped would back their case moved in the wrong direction.\n\nInflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, with a gauge of underlying trends also wrong-footing analysts by edging higher. Elsewhere, wage rises failed to moderate in the first quarter -- suggesting elevated growth in services prices will persist. Another crucial measure of pay is due Friday and may paint a similar picture.\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, has bounced back more forcefully than expected from its malaise. Aside from the outperformance in growth, unemployment hit an all-time low in April and the troubled manufacturing sector is finally showing signs of life.\n\nECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has said inflation and wage gains will \"bounce around\" this year, even as the general trend is for them to abate. Policy must continue to restrict activity throughout 2024, he says.\n\nWhile the ECB has now cut before both the Fed and the BOE, which are grappling with more stubborn price pressures and are only expected to follow suit in the coming months, counterparts in other parts of the world have already started easing.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate on Wednesday and said more moves may come -- becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to do so since the biggest global inflation shock since the 1970s erupted.

The services component, which more accurately captures home-grown price pressures, jumped back over four per cent.\n\nWage growth meanwhile climbed back up to record levels in the first quarter of 2024, with negotiated pay settlements rising 4.7 per cent from a year ago. Most economists had expected pay growth to ease.\n\nThis means that although a cut tomorrow is a near certainty, markets have scaled back their expectations for cuts later in the year. Most economists now think that the ECB will only cut rates twice, although a third is a possibility.\n\n\"It's the outlook beyond June that is still open,\" analysts at ING said. \"We expect the ECB to scale back its guidance endeavour and swing back towards data dependency after stronger-than-expected wages and inflation figures.\"\n\nAlongside its latest rate decision, the ECB will publish its quarterly economic forecasts, which are likely to show more persistent inflation. Gabriele Fo\u00e0, portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, said this would create \"an awkward backdrop for the cut\".\n\n\"As things stand, we believe an ECB cut this week may soon be viewed as a policy mistake,\" he said.\n\nAnother factor constraining the potential pace of rate cuts is how much the ECB will diverge from the US Federal Reserve. Markets do not think the Fed will cut rates until at least September, reflecting the underlying strength of the US economy.\n\nHowever, if the ECB were to take a markedly different approach to the Fed, then the euro would likely weaken significantly against the dollar, making imports more expensive.\n\nThe Bank of England meanwhile is likely to cut rates in either August or September.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_dorrell@cityam.com", "name": "Chris Dorrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wage growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dependent territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GERMANY-EU-EUROZONE-BANKING-ECB-scaled-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Despite this, the recent decision has prompted discussions over the possibility of the Federal Reserve of the United States taking a similar action during their next meetings, as per Coingape.\n\nECB Declares Its First Rate Cut Following the Year 2019\n\nThe European Central Bank's most recent announcement, which brought the interest rate down by 0.25% to 4.25%, increased market optimism during the central bank's most recent meeting. At the same time, the market was expecting the European Central Bank to make an announcement of a similar nature.\n\nTo bring the raging inflation under control, the European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the interest rate to 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023. The headline inflation rate in the Euro Zone reached its highest point of 10.6% in October, but the European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced prices to 2.6% in the most recent month thanks to the increased interest rates.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is that the interest rates for the primary refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility all dropped to 42.5 percent, 4.5 percent, and 3.75 percent, respectively.\n\nThe large decline, observed in May 2024, has assisted the authorities in lowering the policy rates, although inflation has remained at the highest point of the bank's goal range of 2%. According to the most recent predictions by the European Central Bank (ECB), the average inflation rate is projected to decrease to 2.2% by the next year and then to 1.9% in 2026.\n\nOn the other side, the projection indicated that the core inflation rate, which does not include food and energy prices, is expected to decline to 2.2% in 2025 and then to 2% in the following year.\n\nWill the Federal Reserve in the United States Follow Suit?\n\nBecause of the epidemic caused by the COVID-19 virus and other geopolitical unrest, inflation has been one of the most significant concerns worldwide, which has hurt investors' sentiment up until now.\n\nWith the European Central Bank (ECB) announcing its first rate decrease in years, expectations have skyrocketed over a similar move by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the United States scheduled for the following week.\n\nEven though the Federal Reserve has maintained its skepticism about its policy rate intentions, the most recent data from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicates that inflation is decreasing. The persistent inflation rate, on the other hand, casts a shadow over the Fed's decision to reduce interest rates. The most recent PCE data is still at 2.7%, which is greater than the Fed's target range of 2%.\n\nHaving said that, investors will be keeping a careful eye on the impending work statistics for the United States, which are due to be released tomorrow. Following that, attention will move to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation statistics and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) interest rate decision in the following week.\n\nThe European Central Bank's decision skyrocketed the Euro-US Dollar by 0.18%. On the other hand, the yield on the 10-year US bond increased by 0.54%, while the average value of the US dollar index decreased by 0.07%.\n\nA look at the cryptocurrency market reveals that the price of Bitcoin increased by 0.80% to $71,308.30, while the price of Ethereum increased by 1.37% to $3,857.54. Additionally, the total value of the global cryptocurrency market increased marginally to $2.64 trillion.

This is the first interest rate cut since September 2019.\n\nMore specifically, the European Central Bank cut the key deposit rate to 3.75% from 4%, marking the start of the downward cycle.\n\nRecall that in 14 months, interest rates had risen 10 times, reaching record levels, and for a further 9 months, they had remained unchanged.\n\nAt the same time, it is the first time in recent years that the European Central Bank has cut rates before the US Fed has cut its own dollar rates.\n\nRelaxing announcements on the European Central Bank's rationale are expected to be made by Christine Lagarde in a few hours.\n\nToday's cut marks the end to the interest rate hikes that began after the pandemic as inflation soared. However, investors' attention seems to have already begun to turn to what will happen in the next few sessions.\n\nEurozone inflation in May was slightly higher at 2.6%. In addition, negotiated wage growth accelerated again in the first quarter to 4.7% after 4.5% in Q4 2023.\n\nAlthough a new rate cut in July cannot be ruled out, given recent comments from ECB policymakers, it does not seem very likely.\n\nThe ECB statement\n\nThe Governing Council decided today to cut the ECB's three key interest rates by 25 basis points. In line with the updated assessment of the outlook for inflation, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the intensity with which monetary policy is transmitted, it now seems appropriate to moderate the degree of contractionary change in monetary policy after nine months of keeping interest rates fixed.\n\nSince the September 2023 Board meeting, inflation has declined by more than 2.5 percentage points and the outlook for inflation has improved significantly.\n\nUnderlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing evidence that price pressures have eased, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. The moderation in demand and the stabilisation of inflation expectations have made a significant contribution to bringing inflation back to lower levels.\n\nAt the same time, despite progress in recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as the pace of wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to remain above target for much of next year as well.\n\nThe Eurosystem's most recent expert projections for headline and core inflation have been revised upwards for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. The experts now expect headline inflation to average 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. As for inflation excluding energy and food, they forecast it to average 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that inflation returns to its medium-term target of 2% in time. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as deemed necessary to achieve this target.\n\nSee Also\n\nTasos Birsim: The Mastermind Behind Andreas Papandreou's Electoral Campaigns Has Passed Away\n\nThe Governing Council will continue to follow an evidence-based approach and take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis to determine the appropriate size and duration of the contractionary change in monetary policy.\n\nIn particular, its decisions on interest rates will be based on its assessment of the outlook for inflation in light of incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the intensity with which monetary policy is transmitted. The Board is not committed in advance to a specific path for interest rates.\n\nThe Governing Council also confirmed today that it will reduce the securities held by the Eurosystem under the Pandemic Exceptional Asset Purchase Programme (PEPP) by an average of EUR 7.5 billion per month in the second half of this year.

The Euro's strength contributed significantly to the Index's performance. Concurrently, U.S. Treasury yields showed minimal movement, with investors assessing economic data and future interest rate expectations.\n\nThe ECB announced a reduction in its key interest rate to 3.75%, down from the previous 4%, despite persistent inflationary pressures within the euro zone. This move was anticipated by markets, marking the first rate cut since September 2019. The ECB cited an updated assessment of inflation and the effectiveness of its monetary policy as reasons for this adjustment.\n\nIn updated macroeconomic projections, the ECB staff increased the inflation forecast for 2024 to 2.5% from 2.3% and for 2025 to 2.2% from 2%. The 2026 forecast remains steady at 1.9%. Although markets had fully priced in the 25 basis point cut, there is only one further reduction expected this year, with economists predicting up to two more cuts over the period.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields remained flat-to-lower as investors processed recent economic data and looked forward to the upcoming May jobs report. The ADP report released earlier in the week showed private payrolls increased by 152,000 in May, falling short of the 175,000 forecast. Additionally, April job openings hit a three-year low at 8.059 million.\n\nMeanwhile, ISM's purchasing managers index for the services sector rose to 53.8 in May, surpassing the expected 50.7, indicating an expansion. Investors also awaited import and export data, along with initial jobless claims figures, due later on Thursday.\n\nThe ECB's rate cut positions it ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve in terms of easing monetary policy. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized the ECB's data-dependent approach, distinct from the Fed's strategy. Canada also cut rates recently, becoming the first G7 nation to do so in this cycle, following similar moves by Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nThursday's ECB rate cut and the subsequent rise in the Euro suggest a bearish outlook for the U.S. Dollar Index in the short term.

The ECB has kept rates unchanged for the past nine months and tightened policy from July 2022 to September 2023, raising rates by a combined 450 basis points.\n\nIn May, overall eurozone inflation added 0.2 percentage points to 2.6%. However, that didn't stop the ECB, which has been preparing markets for months for today's move. However, the move to ease ECB policy is supported by other data.\n\nProducer prices have been falling every month for the past six months, and in April were 5.7% lower than a year earlier. This decline creates room for final retail prices to fall.\n\nThe euro-region economy is also on the side of the doves at the ECB, as GDP for Q1 2024 added 0.3% after two quarters of contraction at 0.1% and is now higher by a modest 0.4% y/y. This weak performance allows for little fear of inflationary risks from strong domestic demand. Rather than the opposite, Europe needs mild stimulus to avoid slipping further into recession due to tight policy.\n\nThe fall in prices of a wide range of commodities makes it unnecessary to fear a return of 2022-style inflation. However, recent trends in container shipping prices make us wary of a possible repeat of the logistical problems seen in 2020-2021.\n\nIt is almost certain that the ECB is not done with rate cuts this year, but whether we see two more rate cuts or more depends on inflation data. Current trends in inflation and economic activity are setting us up for the ECB to \"reduce monetary policy tightness\" faster than the Fed.

This move has long been telegraphed to markets,\" said Frederik Ducrozet, chief economist at Pictet Wealth Management.\n\n\"The focus will now shift to what is going to happen after June.\"\n\nThe ECB's tightening campaign began after inflation was driven higher by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pandemic-related supply chain woes, with the bank hiking 10 consecutive times.\n\n- Rapid easing not expected -\n\nBut Thursday's expected cut is unlikely to herald the start of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10 percent in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult.\n\nData last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year, up from April's 2.4-percent increase.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nInvestors will be keenly watching to see if ECB president Christine Lagarde provides any guidance about the pace of cuts going forward in her post-meeting press conference.\n\nThe central bank will also release its own updated forecasts for growth and inflation on Thursday, which will feed into rate-setters' debate about their next move.\n\nBerenberg bank economist Holger Schmieding expects, however, that the \"ECB will probably provide little clarity on the further outlook for its monetary policy\", and continue to insist that it will respond to incoming data.\n\nBut given the volatility of recent data, the chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, many analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nThis view was strengthened by recent comments from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's rate-setting governing council, who said rates would be reduced gradually with a focus on quarterly meetings.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting in mid-June -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns if the ECB cuts faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nsr/hmn/lth/dhw\n\nMore from this section\n\nLuvme

Central banks in Switzerland and Sweden have also cut interest rates this year.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference later Thursday.\n\nAnalysts doubt the central bank will cut rates again at its next meeting in July. Eurozone inflation ticked up more than expected in May, to 2.6% from 2.4% the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also accelerated as wages grew rapidly.\n\nThe European economy, which only narrowly avoided a recession last year, is also showing signs of recovery, which could cause inflation to rise again.\n\nIn May, combined output in manufacturing and services hit a 12-month high, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank. Business confidence, meanwhile, reached its strongest level in more than two years.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said the data \"indicates... that the eurozone's economy is gathering further strength.\"\n\nAnother factor that could influence the ECB's thinking is the timing of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, expected later this year. Policymakers in Frankfurt will be hesitant to move too far ahead of the Fed as that could cause the euro to lose value against the dollar, which could then push up inflation in Europe by raising the price of imports.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to attract more international capital flows into a country, lifting demand for its currency.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanna_ziady@cnn.com", "name": "Hanna Ziady", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Commercial_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg Commercial Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1244264415.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

That's put the ECB on course to loosen monetary policy before either the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, where the problem is proving more stubborn.\n\nWhere the ECB goes from here is unclear, with views becoming more cautious in the wake of data showing stronger-than-anticipated economic growth, inflation and wage increases. While most economists reckon there will be three rate cuts this year, investors have pared back their expectations and are only fully pricing two.\n\nLagarde will discuss the situation at a 2.45 pm briefing in Frankfurt - 30 minutes after the ECB's policy announcement.\n\nOfficials have fuelled long-standing expectations of this week's 25 basis-point cut. Even hawkish Governing Council members such as Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel and Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel have maintained that there are sufficient grounds for such a move.\n\nThat level of commitment has raised some eyebrows following the recent batch of economic reports.\n\n\"If they were consistent with their reaction function, they should actually be holding this week,\" said Soeren Radde, an economist at Point72. \"Which tells you that it's a political compromise they came up with.\"\n\nAnatoli Annenkov, an economist at Societe Generale, called the latest data \"not unambiguously supportive of policy easing, leaving a question mark as to why policymakers have been so focused on June, already since early this year\".\n\nSome have spoken out against a second straight cut in July, though Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau wants that option to remain available and Italy's Fabio Panetta argues that policy will remain tight even after several cuts.\n\nThe focus is increasingly on the quarterly meetings for which fresh economic projections are produced - June, September and December - because that's also when more of the relevant data on wages, corporate profits and productivity is available, as Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot has stated.\n\nEconomists do not expect material shifts in this round of ECB forecasts, which they reckon will again show inflation returning to target in 2025. There may be an upward revision for growth this year, however, after first-quarter gross domestic product topped estimates.\n\nOne figure to watch is core inflation for 2026, which is currently seen at 2 per cent. An increase may be taken as a signal that the bar for further monetary easing is high.\n\nAnother wrinkle is that these projections are put together by national central banks, alongside ECB staff. In the past, \"there has been a sense\" that this setup can lead to more hawkish outcomes, according to JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi.\n\nWhile the ECB looked set to diverge from the Fed until recently, the stickiness of some inflation categories in Europe is prompting comparisons to the challenge faced by officials on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nUS policymakers have to had to rethink monetary loosening after price gains surpassed expectations, even if traders are still hopeful of a rate cut this year. The Bank of England is also unlikely to cut this month, while the Bank of Canada did so on Wednesday.\n\nWithin Europe but outside of the eurozone, Sweden's Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are among those to have already begun to ease policy.

Euro zone bond yields rose, with Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield last up 6 basis points at 2.56%, versus 2.53% earlier.

They are not committing to further rate cuts and a July move is off the table.\"\n\n\"The focus for markets is whether they will find room to cut in September.\"\n\n\"The ECB revised up their inflation forecasts and I am not surprised.

The outlook for inflation, as indicated by the ECB's latest projections, point to further interest rate reductions later this year.\"\n\n\"Of course, the timing of the next move from the ECB is uncertain, as this will be dependent upon incoming data. But with the disinflationary process firmly underway, the ECB, along with other central banks, should feel confident enough to ease policy, most likely at a pace of one cut per quarter. Moreover, we should expect this rate-cutting cycle to continue into 2025.\"", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEK550IX_M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

This will mean that the ECB is likely to be one of the first major central banks to cut rates. The market has been betting heavily that the ECB will lower its benchmark deposit rate by a quarter percentage point from its record high of 4% after eurozone inflation fell close to the bank's 2% target in recent months. Eurozone inflation has fallen from above 10% at its peak in 2022 to a near three-year low of 2.4% in April. However, the May figures, published last week, indicate an upturn in eurozone inflation, which accelerated for the first time this year from 2.4% in April to 2.6% in May.\n\nDoes this imply that despite the signals given in recent days, the ECB might now hesitate to cut rates? It does not seem like it. Although, the European Central Bank had pledged to take a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, the sensation is that it will brush off the recent upturn in eurozone inflation and start cutting rates anyway.\n\nLooking globally, the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary have lowered borrowing costs this year in response to declining inflation. In contrast, however, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are not expected to cut rates before the summer, while the Bank of Japan is more likely to continue raising them. Some analysts have warned that if the ECB diverges from the Fed by cutting rates more aggressively it could cause the euro to depreciate and push up inflation by raising the price of imports into the bloc. Some analysts argue risks are skewed towards less cuts, mainly on the back of sticky services inflation and a resilient labour market. They believe the ECB's likely action could be a mistake if eurozone inflation continues to deviate from its 2% target, especially as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England delay their rate cuts.\n\nAll types of analysis indicate that inflation had fallen faster in the eurozone than the US, because the region had been hit harder by the energy shock triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, beyond whether the ECB cuts interest rates, such interest rates will remain in restrictive territory this year to ensure that inflation keeps easing. That is what theory suggests.\n\nReality on the ground is that data is showing that eurozone wage growth picked up to a near-record pace at the start of this year, but is now showing some signs of deceleration, although still on the increase.\n\nPersonally, my view is that with the record climb of interest rates, this did pretty nothing to dent one of the main factors effecting eurozone inflation, that is, service inflation. As we all know, service inflation does not respond to monetary policy as quickly as other types of inflation. Add to that the fact that I personally believe we have a choice to make to really understand the new reality of eurozone economies and their composition.\n\nOn one hand, maybe it is time to revisit whether the holy grail of the 2% inflation target is something still feasible considering that most eurozone economies have a heavy composition of services, and the underlying reasons of services inflation is linked to long-term issues related to demography, skills and investments in technology. This brings me to the second linked point. One of the ways to ease pressures on wage growth, is by investing in technology to increase efficiencies and possibly automate certain processes, enabling businesses to do more with less people. However, when interest rates are high they are also deterring such much-needed investments in technology. Which means that it is likely that the tightened monetary policy \"medicine\" to bring down inflation, is having a reverse effect within the background of having many eurozone economies being heavily service-based.", "source": {"uri": "maltabusinessweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "maltabusinessweekly.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "silvan_mifsud@maltabusinessweekly.com", "name": "Silvan Mifsud", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2.wp.com/maltabusinessweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/12-13-op-Silvan-Mifsud.jpg?fit=709%2C456&ssl=1&p=26215", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Fed also has a wider remit to protect employment.\n\nBut there are bigger structural forces at play than the predilections of policymakers.\n\nAt one point early this year, the Fed was forecast to make up to seven interest rate reductions this year but in the face of stubbornly strong inflation, it may now not even make one. Part of the problem is the strength of the US economy which continues to grow strongly despite the Fed's efforts to slow it down.\n\nECB policymakers have, in contrast, faced weak or anaemic growth. The euro zone economy fell into a mini recession last year under the weight of stalling demand driven by higher interest rates. Hence Frankfurt rate setters are perhaps more comfortable lifting the interest rate anvil than their Fed counterparts.\n\nBut this transatlantic divergence on inflation may soon begin to narrow again.\n\n[ ECB cuts interest rates by 0.25 percentage points after two years of hikes ]\n\nHeadline inflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, accelerating from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent. Wage growth across the EU has also failed to moderate as policymakers would have liked. This explains why price growth in the services sector, where wages play a bigger role, remains a key concern.\n\nThe euro zone economy has also rebounded stronger than expected from last year's reversal, growing by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter (it had contracted by 0.1 per cent in the previous two quarters). While much of the growth was generated by a bounce back in services, the continent's troubled manufacturing sector, which has been battered by the surge in energy prices, showed signs of life.\n\n[ Interest rates will remain high, even as the ECB starts cutting ]\n\nAt the post rate-setting press conference, ECB president Christine Lagarde was asked if Frankfurt had over-committed in signalling a rate cut and was it at odds with increasing the bank's own inflation forecasts.\n\nShe gave a long-winded answer, insisting the bank's confidence in its projections had grown in recent months.

President Lagarde will want to strike a balance that tempers excessive rate cutting expectations seen earlier this year but also acknowledging the ongoing restrictive policy stance and transmission effects.\n\n\"Although inflation expectations remain quite well anchored, recent hard data has not been entirely helpful to those of a more dovish persuasion - early estimates for the month of May showed inflation increasing by more than forecast by markets. Admittedly this is just one datapoint and it won't jeopardise the overall direction of travel for the central bank. Nevertheless, it does remind markets that the last leg of the disinflation journey can be the most difficult - services price inflation is still running at an annual rate of just over 4%.\n\n\"The ECB would like to have greater confidence that inflation is converging sustainably towards target as it embarks on rate cuts. It looks like it may take a little longer for that confidence to increase sufficiently to allow it to relax policy further. The ECB's latest macroeconomic forecasts are also being published today and will be closely scrutinised for any significant changes in key projections. We may be entering a holding phase in the coming months but we do expect further policy easing by year end assuming the disinflation trend continues as we expect.\"\n\nKaspar Hense, senior portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management said: \"The ECB has cut rates as expected to 3.75% after having been at the highest level since its existence for more than half a year. Even though headline inflation has come down significantly, we do not expect a cutting cycle to follow. While Europe has been hit even more so by the increase in gas prices after the Russian invasion into Ukraine, these base effects have indeed faded nicely.\n\n\"On one hand, we believe that growth will remain solid this year due to real disposable income turning positive and expectations around more fiscal unity after the EU election in H2. However, on the other hand, we think that the unemployment rate will remain low, or even go lower from here, with military spending (and in some cases compulsory military service) driving youth unemployment rate even lower. This we anticipate will result in leaving core inflation around 2.5% for the coming 12 months.\"\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown said: ''The European Central Bank has, as widely predicted, cut the eurozone's key interest rate to 3.75%, moving faster than the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. The reduction will come as a relief for many consumers and companies, whose finances have been stretched to breaking point by the rapid ratcheting up of interest rates. But ECB policymakers are expected to hit the pause button now, as sticky inflation has returned as a worry. While rates went straight up like a rocket, they look likely to descend in bumpy fashion.\n\n\"Financial markets have been pricing in two to three rate cuts in total by the ECB by the end of the year, but it's looking unlikely that that policymakers will vote for another move lower next month. Caution is set to stay the name of the game, as they await fresh indications about inflation's path. Headline inflation went in the wrong direction at the last count, heading away from the ECB's 2% target. It rose by 2.6% year-on-year in May, compared to 2.4% for the previous two months, a larger increase than expected. Prices in the services sector, seen as a good indicator of domestic demand, also jumped to 4.1% from 3.7%.\n\n\"However, the overall direction of travel is clear - and it's downwards. The ECB decision will raise hopes that UK interest rates will also be brought down sooner rather than later. The data coming in over the past few days has been more positive for the Bank of England, indicating that price pressures are easing. So an interest rate cut in August is still a very real possibility, although the financial markets have not been fully pricing in a cut until November.\n\nShe continued: \"The Eurozone is in the recovery stage, with growth rising by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, after six quarters of stagnation or contraction. Unlike previous economic rough patches, firms have retained workers - with unemployment now at an all-time low. This means that stubborn pay growth remains a concern for policymakers, following a rise in negotiated salaries.\n\n\"There are concerns that it could feed further into higher prices, which is why policymakers are expected to stay more cautious in the months ahead.\n\n\"If higher borrowing costs persist, this is set to have a further knock-on effect on the bloc's economy, which is only just on the mend. Unemployment is forecast to rise, which may help ease pay pressures, but could cause a fresh weakening in economic activity. Even if interest rates creep down again later this year, as expected, it may not stop further problems for the commercial property sector, given the jump in refinancing costs that many firms will still be facing.\n\n\"The International Monetary Fund has warned that Europe's lacklustre growth prospects risk causing economic instability. On the face of it, European economies are constrained by growing deficits and strict rules on borrowing, which makes it difficult to spend big to boost fragile economies.\n\n\"This is especially the case given the demands on budgets from increased military spending and the need to support the green transition to meet agreed targets. Eleven countries, including France, Italy and Belgium, had deficits last year above 3% of GDP, the official high limit for debt. But there may be some room for manoeuvre given new rules that give a four-year grace period, with an option of extending to seven years - if governments show they are making investments aimed at boosting growth in the economy.''\n\nLindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors: \"The starting gun has been fired and the European Central Bank is the first out of the major three banks to start cutting rates. This is a significant move given it is the first rate cut from the ECB in five years, and ends what has been one of the most aggressive and swift rate hiking cycles in modern times.\n\n\"Importantly, this is not likely to be a single cut and done for a while, with signals suggesting a further cut or two are on the horizon this year as inflation has subsided. The ECB has stolen a march on the Bank of England and Federal Reserve - who are both potentially still a few months away from cutting - and will breathe life into an economy that desperately needs some form of stimulus.\n\n\"While this news was well expected, it will no doubt provide relief to consumers and businesses on the continent. Ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europe has struggled to combat the economic shock this produced, but signs are now improving, although uneven across the continent. While inflation has ticked up in recent months, the economic recovery is beginning to play out. This puts the ECB in a good position to cut further into a slowly improving picture, although the messaging is likely to remain restrained and cautious. As such, there may be some pauses on the way back down for rates in order to limit the scope of any divergence with the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"This move also focuses eyes on the BoE, who will make its decision in a couple of weeks. The major central banks will not want to diverge too far from one another, and with political risk being ratcheted up, they also won't want to be seen as too influential.\"\n\nBen Nichols, interim managing director of RAW Capital Partners, said: \"The ECB's decision will resonate with consumers and investors not just in the EU, but globally. While the impact of the cut is unlikely to be felt immediately, the move adds to the growing feeling that the global economy has turned a corner, and should provide some impetus to the Eurozone's business investment, consumer spending and housing markets. We could also see investor sentiment experience something of an uptick in the aftermath of this decision, which could instigate a pick-up in global trade and investment.\n\n\"However, the risk remains that the ECB is cutting rates too early, and it will be intriguing to see if the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England follow suit in the coming months. The outlook for energy prices is unreliable and geopolitical conflict in Europe and the Middle East could create major challenges further down the line. What's more, the Eurozone's labour market remains surprisingly strong. Therefore, a rekindling of inflationary pressures remains a significant risk factor if the bank cuts rates too quickly.\n\n\"As a result, investors must watch on with keen interest. The challenge remains ensuring that portfolios can withstand any turbulence that arises from central banks' interest rates decisions by diversifying across a range of uncorrelated asset classes, territories and sectors. This includes building a portfolio of both traditional and alternative investments, which will help reduce volatility, provide down-side protection, and protect recent gains.\"", "source": {"uri":

What it means for markets.", "body": "European Central Bank seen cutting rates for the first time this cycle\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely expected on Thursday to be the first major central bank to cut rates since the end of the pandemic, signaling a sea-change in monetary policy that should see the Bank of England do the same in the summer and the Federal Reserve possibly follow suit in the fall.\n\nMarkets have for many weeks been pricing in a 25 basis point reduction in the ECB's deposit rate from a record high of 4% to 3.75%. Most ECB officials have done little to push back against that assumption.\n\nConsequently, it's what clues the ECB and its President Christine Lagarde provide for future policy trajectory that will be the focus for traders on Thursday.\n\nIn that regard the event this week is being characterized by many analysts as a \"hawkish cut\" - a trimming of borrowing costs accompanied by rhetoric and projections to dissuade the market from expecting any more anytime soon.\n\n\"There is a 95% chance that the ECB will cut interest rates this Thursday,\" says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. \"[H]owever, it's what comes next that matters more for financial markets and for the euro, in particular,\" she adds.\n\nA back-to-back cut in July is deemed unlikely, with markets attaching only a roughly 10% chance to that scenario, according to Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING. \"A second cut is almost fully priced by October, but it's a third cut this year that is hanging in the balance,\" Pesole added.\n\nMost analysts expect ECB President Christine Lagarde will not commit to the timing of further policy loosening, particularly as inflation in the eurozone rose last month from 2.4% to 2.6%.\n\n\"We expect questions during the press conference to focus on the path for rates beyond June, and we believe Mme, Lagarde will underscore data dependency and taking a meeting-by-meeting approach,\" said Nomura's economics team led by Andrzej Szczepaniak.\n\nClaus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics goes further in a recent note: \"The ECB will cut its policy rate by 25bp this week, but the communication will be hawkish.\"\n\nThere are three reasons why Lagarde may wish to imply this month's rate cut will be all for now.\n\nThe first is that along with last month's pick up in the pace of consumer price rises, recent economic surveys have shown signs of improvement that may make it harder to get inflation down to the ECB's 2% target.\n\nEurozone first-quarter 2024 gross domestic product increased by 0.3% from the previous three months, the strongest expansion in a year-and-a-half, while negotiated wage growth returned to a multi-year high of 4.7% compared to the same period in 2023.\n\n\"This signals that negotiated wage growth has remained elevated in the euro area,\" said the ECB in late May, raising fears that services inflation in particular will stay sticky.\n\nSecond, it's believed the ECB does not want to signal another rate cut at the next meeting in July, lest the markets assume that such regularity will continue and will end up disappointed.\n\nFinally, there remains some wariness about how markets may react to a divergence in policy between the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which may not consider trimming rates for several months.\n\nSuch a widening differential between eurozone and U.S. interest rates might punish the euro. That may be good for exporters in Europe but may also make the ECB's task harder by lifting inflation via more expensive imports.\n\n\"[I]f we are right with our call for a first Fed cut in September, then the dollar should have a bad summer,\" said ING's Pesole. \"While the euro...may lag other pro-cyclical G10 currencies in a USD decline, EUR/USD (EURUSD) should still be able to make it to 1.10 in the coming months.\"\n\nA hawkish ECB on Thursday could help push the 10-year German Bund yield BX:TMBMKDE-10Y back, currently 2.52%, back above 2.60%, Pesole added.\n\nAnd with regards to eurozone stocks, providing Largarde and colleagues don't push back too heavily against future rate cuts, then the outlook is positive, according to analysts at Citi.\n\n\"Historically, 12-month forward price/earning multiples for the MSCI Europe are up 10% on average one year after cuts begin,\" said the U.S. bank. \"Combined with an inflecting earnings picture, this should help justify some additional upside for the STOXX 600 XX:SXXP to year-end.\"\n\nThe European stock market index has gained 9% this year, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 SPX, which is up 11%.\n\n-Jamie Chisholm\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

This cut follows a 9-month period with unchanged policy rates on the back of the rapid hiking cycle since mid-2022. The rate cut was widely expected and thus focus was on the communication.\n\nThe updated staff projections showed inflation to hit 2% one quarter later (Q4 25) than at the time of the March meeting.\n\nWith the rate cut fully anticipated, some initial volatility was quickly replaced with markets trading in a tight range, with no commitment on the timing of the next policy rate cut, although the meeting with staff projections (September, December, March, and June) seems preferable with a lot more information provided.\n\nWe continue to look for the next policy rate cut in December in our baseline scenario, although we do not rule out a potential rate cut in September.\n\nAcknowledging the progress - not confirming the dialling back phase\n\nThe ECB's decision to cut rates was widely expected by market participants and did not come as a surprise. The decision itself was agreed by most GC members, except one member (Reuters sources reported this to be Holzmann). The staff projections showed an upward revision of growth and inflation this year with a direct reference to inflation still above 2% next year. Coupled with guidance of \"keeping\" the policy rates restrictive to bring inflation to the target, we maintain our call for the next policy rate cut to occur in December, contrary to market pricing and consensus among analysts who expect a September rate cut.\n\nAs discussed in COTW: staying restrictive - not yet entering the dialling back phase, we did not expect Lagarde to confirm that they have entered the dialling back phase, which in our reading would be a commitment to a string of policy rate cuts. When asked about it, she did 'volunteer' that we have entered the dialling back phase, although she pointed to a \"strong likelihood\" of this being the dialling back phase, but she would not confirm this. To us this means that the ECB does not want to pre-commit to a specific meeting or policy rate path. The ECB kept its meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach for its threetiered reaction function (inflation outlook, underlying inflation, and strength of the monetary policy). Markets are now pricing an additional 36bp of rate cuts by year-end (on top of today's rate cut, which takes effect on Wednesday next week).\n\nStaff projections show higher inflation and growth\n\nThe ECB expects the economy to continue its recovery as the manufacturing sector stabilises, exports pick up, and monetary policy will exert less of a drag on activity. The updated staff projections show higher inflation both this year and next year due to the persistent pressure from domestic inflation and elevated wage growth. HICP is now expected to average 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, which is 0.2pp. higher than the March projections in both years. Likewise, expectations for core inflation were revised up to 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% next year from 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Lagarde noted that inflation will fluctuate around the current levels for the rest of the year before settling towards the 2% target next year.\n\nThe sticky expected inflation outlook is largely driven by the elevated wage growth. The ECB staff expect wage growth of 4.8% this year (previously 4.5%), 3.5% in 2025 (previously 3.6%), and 3.2% in 2026 (previously 3.0%). Lagarde noted that wages will remain elevated, but this is largely due to catching up with previous inflation, while the forward-looking wage tracker shows declining wage pressures. Rising economic activity also adds to inflationary pressures. The GDP growth expectation for 2024 was increased to 0.9% y/y from 0.6%, reflecting stronger-than-expected growth in Q1, as well as marginally higher future growth expectations. The ECB now sees balanced risks to the growth outlook in the short-term, which are changed from downside in March, while all expectations for 2026 were unchanged (see chart).", "source": {"uri": "actionforex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Action Forex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danske_bank@actionforex.com", "name": "Danske Bank", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonised_Index_of_Consumer_Prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/f-ecb46.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

first rate cut since 2019 but sees 'bumpy road'", "body": "The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the first time since 2019 on Thursday as eurozone inflation gradually eases, but president Christine Lagarde said the path ahead was unclear and warned of a \"bumpy road\".\n\nThe key deposit rate was lowered a quarter point to 3.75 percent, bringing it down from a record high.\n\nFollowing an unprecedented streak of eurozone rate hikes beginning in mid-2022 to tame runaway energy and food costs, inflation has been slowly coming down towards the ECB's two-percent target.\n\nThursday's cut, the first since September 2019, came after the central bank kept rates on hold since October and will provide a much-needed boost for the beleaguered eurozone economy.\n\nThe move marks the ECB diverging from the US Federal Reserve, which has also hiked rates aggressively but is not expected to start cutting for months due to stronger-than-expected data.\n\nAll eyes are on what happens next but the path ahead has been complicated by recent stronger-than-expected inflation and growth data, which has lowered the chances of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nAt a press conference following the rate decision, Lagarde insisted that the Frankfurt-based institution was not \"pre-committing to any particular rate path\".\n\n\"What is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she said. \"We know its going to be a bumpy road.\"\n\n- Sticky inflation -\n\nThe ECB's updated forecasts released Thursday highlighted the challenges.\n\nThe central bank hiked its inflation projections for this year and next, saying it no longer expects the indicator to hit the two-percent target in 2025, as previously anticipated, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nIt came after data released last week showed inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession.\n\nWhile inflation has eased, Lagarde noted that it still remained high, pointing to the fact that \"wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge.\"\n\nBut she also said that some indicators suggested that wage growth would ease over the course of the year.\n\nThe eurozone economy is expected to continue recovering, Lagarde said.\n\nBut she also warned of risks ranging from a weaker world economy to escalating trade tensions, and noted that the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are \"major sources of geopolitical risk\".\n\n- Divergence worries -\n\nWith data volatile and uncertainty clouding the horizon, the chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, some analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski believed the central bank could follow this path but also cautioned things could turn out differently.\n\n\"It wouldn't take a lot of negative inflation surprises for the ECB to tread more carefully or even reverse today's cut,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns about the ECB cutting faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nFor the ECB, \"there may be some pauses on the way back down for rates in order to limit the scope of any divergence with the Federal Reserve,\" predicted Lindsay James, from Quilter Investors.\n\nsr/hmn/lth", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news",

The US' inflation rate for May will be published on 12 June.\n\nYesterday, the Bank of Canada was the first central bank in the G7 to reduce interest rates, with a cut to 4.75%. Earlier this year, Switzerland's central bank made a reduction from 1.75% to 1.5%, while Sweden's fell from 4% to 3.75%.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this move brought about the \"long-awaited pivot in monetary policy\" and signalled \"the start of a new era\".\n\nHe added: \"We're now beginning the next phase in the cycle where inflationary pressures ease and central banks move to a new playbook to help prop up a flagging economy and make life easier for consumers and businesses who have had to stomach sky-high borrowing costs.\n\n\"The Bank of England and Federal Reserve might give the impression they aren't swayed by what the ECB and other countries do, but the greater the number of central banks cutting, the more pressure they will be under to do the same.\"\n\nLindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the \"starting gun had been fired\" by the ECB, adding that this was significant as it was the first cut by the central bank in five years and ended \"what has been one of the most aggressive and swift rate-hiking cycles in modern times\".\n\nShe added: \"Importantly, this is not likely to be a single cut and done for a while, with signals suggesting a further cut or two are on the horizon this year as inflation has subsided. The ECB has stolen a march on the Bank of England and Federal Reserve - who are both potentially still a few months away from cutting - and will breathe life into an economy that desperately needs some form of stimulus.\n\n\"This move also focuses eyes on the BoE, who will make its decision in a couple of weeks. The major central banks will not want to diverge too far from one another, and with political risk being ratcheted up, they also won't want to be seen as too influential.\"\n\nBen Nichols, interim managing director of RAW Capital Partners, said: \"While the impact of the cut is unlikely to be felt immediately, the move adds to the growing feeling that the global economy has turned a corner, and should provide some impetus to the Eurozone's business investment, consumer spending and housing markets.\"\n\nHowever, Nichols added: \"The risk remains that the ECB is cutting rates too early, and it will be intriguing to see if the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England follow suit in the coming months.\"\n\nHe said the outlook for energy prices was still \"unreliable\" and geopolitical conflict could create challenges in the future. Nichols also said the Eurozone's strong labour market could see inflationary pressures return if rates have been lowered too quickly.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ECB had moved faster than the BoE and Federal Reserve, but was \"expected to hit the pause button now, as sticky inflation has returned as a worry\".\n\n\"While rates went straight up like a rocket, they look likely to descend in bumpy fashion,\" Streeter said.\n\nShe added: \"Financial markets have been pricing in 2-3 rate cuts in total by the ECB by the end of the year, but it's looking unlikely that policymakers will vote for another move lower next month.\n\n\"Caution is set to stay the name of the game, as they await fresh indications about inflation's path.\"\n\nStreeter said the Eurozone's headline inflation rate \"went in the wrong direction\" and moved further away from the ECB's 2% target when it rose from 2.4% in March and April to 2.6% in May.\n\n\"However, the overall direction of travel is clear - and it's downwards. The ECB decision will raise hopes that UK interest rates will also be brought down sooner rather than later. The data coming in over the past few days has been more positive for the Bank of England, indicating that price pressures are easing.\n\n\"So an interest rate cut in August is still a very real possibility, although the financial markets have not been fully pricing in a cut until November,\" she added.\n\nThe BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will make its next base rate decision on 20 June.", "source": {"uri": "mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mortgage Solutions"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shekina_tuahene@mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "name": "Shekina Tuahene", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_James_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsay James (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2024/05/2361438-bank-of-england-front-764x399-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 471, "textEnd": 478}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 4532, "textEnd": 4539}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

It is true to say, however, that the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a rate cut of 0.25 per cent to its key rate, which will be welcome news for some people.\n\nTracker mortgage holders, basically. There are more than 100,000 homeowners still on the loan arrangements that Irish banks were throwing around like confetti until the crash in 2008. And as you probably know by now a tracker mortgage is tied to ECB rates so when those rates go up trackers automatically go up and when the ECB rates go down, Irish mortgage holders' tracker rates automatically go down.\n\nNot remotely, it was widely anticipated and it would have been a shock had the bankers in Frankfurt not cut rates by that margin.\n\nIt has a number of different rates but the refinance rate is the one that is key to what you pay for your loans. It is currently 4.5 per cent and with this cut it will come down to 4.25 per cent which is still a long, long way off the zero per cent interest rates of times past.\n\nThe ECB has long sought to steady inflation across the euro zone at a rate of 2 per cent. For a decade, inflation was running at substantially less than which is why rates fell to zero and, for banks depositing money with the ECB, even less than zero for long periods. Then, with the end of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, inflation spiralled - to close to 10 per cent in some instances. That saw the ECB adopt an aggressive monetary policy with rates increasing 10 times in less than two years starting in July 2022.\n\nThat very much depends on a person's circumstances. Tracker mortgage holders were the worst hit and there were few of that cohort who were left with much change out of \u20ac3,500 once the annual higher cost of their loans were totted up.\n\n[ Cliff Taylor: Interest rates will remain high, even as the ECB starts cutting ]\n\nAnd those figures are net, so people needed to earn almost twice the level of the mortgage increases just to stay in the same financial position they were\n\nNo. Variable rate holders, and people with fixed-rate mortgages that were coming to the end of agreed terms, first-time buyers trying to climb on to the property ladder and people who had loans controlled by mortgage service providers - sometimes referred to as vulture funds - also had to confront a very different and expensive new reality as a result of ECB policies. Higher interest rates also restricted how much house-hunters have been able to borrow with the amount of demonstrated repayment capacity banks are looking for climbed by as much as \u20ac600 a month for a \u20ac300,000 mortgage\n\nIt will mean very little - nothing really - if you have no mortgage or are on a long-term fixed rate. It will, most likely, mean very little if you are on a variable rate - at least in the short term. If, however, you have a tracker mortgage, you will stand to benefit from the rate cut almost immediately.\n\nTracker holders will see their rates fall by the quarter point within 30 days.\n\nAgain, that depends on multiple factors - the key one being the size of the loan. The average tracker rate will fall from 5.9 per cent to 5.65 per cent which will amount to a reduction in monthly repayments of just over \u20ac13 per month for every \u20ac100,000 outstanding over a 15-year term. To save you having to do the maths, a person with a \u20ac250,000 mortgage will save around \u20ac33 a month or just over \u20ac350 a year.\n\nSpiral might be too strong a word but rates do look like they are heading down. The rate at which they do that very much depends on what happens in the broader economy - particularly in France, Germany and the other big players in the euro zone.\n\nWe might like to think so but in pure numeric terms we are quite the small fish.\n\nThe ECB is likely to be cautious when it comes to rate moves and it has made it clear that it will continue to monitor inflation with the aim of getting it to that magic 2 per cent figure - right now it is 2.4 per cent. The ECB's monetary policy committee meets again in July, September, October and December and in advance of these meetings data on inflation will be monitored. If inflation is stable or falling and/or economic growth is sluggish rates, may fall quicker than anticipated or they may fall more slowly if the reverse is true.\n\nHad you asked this question six months ago, we might have said there could be multiple rate cuts amounting to as much as 1.5 percentage points over the course of 2024. That seems like wishful thinking now. Most analysts are saying that - at best - the cumulative rate cuts between now and the end of the year will not be more than 0.75 percentage points. In that scenario, the mortgage holder with an outstanding loan of \u20ac250,000 would see their repayments fall by around \u20ac100 a month. That will still leave them worse off by more than \u20ac300 compared to the situation before the ECB started hiking its rates.\n\nAnyone who took out a mortgage after 2008 does not have a tracker rate and this ECB rate cut won't automatically be passed on. While fixed rates being offered to new customers are now much higher than they were three years ago when 10 year fixed rates of as little as 2 per cent were on the table, they have, generally speaking, not climbed as dramatically as tracker rates. Rates of 3.5 per cent are available to certain borrowers. Variable rates climbed too but, again, not by as much as might have been feared. Many Irish banks have already announced rate decreases in recent weeks that have factored in the latest ECB decrease.\n\nBanks were very slow to pass on the ECB rate increases to people with money on deposit - although there has been some upward movement on that front in recent months.

makes first rate cut since 2019 but sees 'bumpy road'", "body": "The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the first time since 2019 on Thursday as eurozone inflation gradually eases, but president Christine Lagarde said the path ahead was unclear and warned of a \"bumpy road\".\n\nThe key deposit rate was lowered a quarter point to 3.75 percent, bringing it down from a record high.\n\nFollowing an unprecedented streak of eurozone rate hikes beginning in mid-2022 to tame runaway energy and food costs, inflation has been slowly coming down towards the ECB's two-percent target.\n\nThursday's cut, the first since September 2019, came after the central bank kept rates on hold since October and will provide a much-needed boost for the beleaguered eurozone economy.\n\nThe move marks the ECB diverging from the US Federal Reserve, which has also hiked rates aggressively but is not expected to start cutting for months due to stronger-than-expected data.\n\nAll eyes are on what happens next but the path ahead has been complicated by recent stronger-than-expected inflation and growth data, which has lowered the chances of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nAt a press conference following the rate decision, Lagarde insisted that the Frankfurt-based institution was not \"pre-committing to any particular rate path\".\n\n\"What is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she said. \"We know its going to be a bumpy road.\"\n\n- Sticky inflation -\n\nThe ECB's updated forecasts released Thursday highlighted the challenges.\n\nThe central bank hiked its inflation projections for this year and next, saying it no longer expects the indicator to hit the two-percent target in 2025, as previously anticipated, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nIt came after data released last week showed inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession.\n\nMore from this section New Rochelle celebrates opening of 'Socceroof' sports facility X formally allowing users to post consensual adult content Hunter Biden's Federal Firearms Trial Begins\n\nWhile inflation has eased, Lagarde noted that it still remained high, pointing to the fact that \"wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge.\"\n\nBut she also said that some indicators suggested that wage growth would ease over the course of the year.\n\nThe eurozone economy is expected to continue recovering, Lagarde said.\n\nBut she also warned of risks ranging from a weaker world economy to escalating trade tensions, and noted that the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are \"major sources of geopolitical risk\".\n\n- Divergence worries -\n\nWith data volatile and uncertainty clouding the horizon, the chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, some analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski believed the central bank could follow this path but also cautioned things could turn out differently.\n\n\"It wouldn't take a lot of negative inflation surprises for the ECB to tread more carefully or even reverse today's cut,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns about the ECB cutting faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nFor the ECB, \"there may be some pauses on the way back down for rates in order to limit the scope of any divergence with the Federal Reserve,\" predicted Lindsay James, from Quilter Investors.\n\nsr/hmn/lth",

It also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nWhile noting that \"the inflation outlook has improved markedly,\" the ECB said in a statement that \"domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\" It reiterated typical language that it would \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to hit its inflation target, and that it would take a \"data-dependent\" approach to is decisions. Decisions would be based on the inflation outlook, it said, while adding that the rate-setting governing council \"is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nDespite consumer price rises having slowed from peaks of over 10% in late 2022, when Europe was rocked by an energy shock, bringing inflation down to the ECB's target is proving difficult. Data last week showed that inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected - to 2.6% on year, up from April's 2.4% increase. The eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession, although it is still slow compared to the robust growth of the US economy.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed - which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 - will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand. But eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/06/06/743/0/7864/3932/1440/720/60/0/e88d814_5699331-01-06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "dateEnd": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2441, "textEnd": 2451}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 89}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 386, "textEnd": 400}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Having kept it at 4% for nine months, they said the inflation outlook has improved \"markedly,\" though they also raised projections for prices.\n\n\"The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nThe decision begins to roll back the unprecedented barrage of hikes deployed to quell the eurozone's worst-ever spike in prices.\n\nThe step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nWhile Lagarde last month declared inflation \"under control,\" a string of recent data has pointed to enduring price pressures. That's prompted investors and economists to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024 to two or three in total.\n\nMoney markets held onto bets that the next cut will probably be in September. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.0880 and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55%.\n\nAn updated quarterly outlook published alongside the ECB's policy statement forecasts inflation averaging 2.2% in 2025, with this year's projection for economic expansion lifted to 0.9% from 0.6% before.\n\nLagarde will hold a news conference at 2:45pm in Frankfurt to elaborate on the ECB's decisions.\n\nThe run-up to Thursday's meeting saw policymakers leave little room for doubt in their intention to lower rates - even after some of the economic numbers they'd hoped would back their case moved in the wrong direction.\n\nInflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, with a gauge of underlying trends also wrong-footing analysts by edging higher. Elsewhere, wage rises failed to moderate in the first quarter - suggesting elevated growth in services prices will persist. Another crucial measure of pay is due Friday and may paint a similar picture.\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, has bounced back more forcefully than expected from its malaise. Aside from the outperformance in growth, unemployment hit an all-time low in April and the troubled manufacturing sector is finally showing signs of life.\n\nECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has said inflation and wage gains will \"bounce around\" this year, even as the general trend is for them to abate. Policy must continue to restrict activity throughout 2024, he says.\n\nWhile the ECB has now cut before both the Fed and the BOE, which are grappling with more stubborn price pressures and are only expected to follow suit in the coming months, counterparts in other parts of the world have already started easing.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate on Wednesday and said more moves may come - becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to do so since the biggest global inflation shock since the 1970s erupted.

interest rates.\n\nECB president Christine Lagarde and other officials have been pretty strong in their suggestions that a cut of a quarter of a percentage point will be made at the meeting.\n\nYesterday the Bank of Canada followed recent moves by the Swiss National Bank and Sweden's Riksbank in making the first interest rate cuts since the pandemic.\n\nEconomist Francesco Pesole at ING says the ECB has \"virtually pre-announced\" that a 25 basis point rate cut will be made at today's meeting.\n\nA cut has been fully priced in by markets, meaning the attention will be on communication from Lagarde, says Pesole.\n\nWhile holding rates \"could make sense\" given the latest wages and inflation data, \"the reputational risk is too high\" and in the event of a surprise hold \"the euro could face a brief earthquake\".\n\nHe added: \"We think it is likely there will be almost no new forward guidance, with the ECB potentially signalling any further easing would only be gradual (in line with off-meeting comments) and that there are still risks to inflation.\n\n\"Inflation forecasts will be watched closely, although the ECB should backpedal towards short-term data dependency, so building policy expectations on new projections would be quite speculative, if not misleading.\"\n\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, said major central banks are looking for a \"narrow path\" for delivering interest rate cuts despite global inflation still running at 3.0% a year, with this path needing to provide some economic stimulus while still remaining moderately restrictive in terms of policy and not weakening currencies too much against the US dollar.\n\nAhead of the June policy meetings for the ECB and Bank of England, the Bank of Canada has \"provided the policy and rhetorical template\", French added.\n\n\"Moving as a herd is an attractive feature for central bankers privately worried about being labelled the Jean-Claude Trichet of this economic cycle.\n\n\"The BoC has just made that task easier for its European counterparts,\" he said.\n\nThere's also a meeting later in the day at Denmark's central bank, whose mandate is to keep stability in the EUR/DKK exchange rate, so it is likely to also cut rates by the same 25 bps a few hours after the ECB.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Market participants will closely scrutinize the language in the policy statement, as well as ECB President Christine Lagarde's words during the press conference to gauge the scope and timing of the next rate cuts this year.\n\nAlthough the Eurozone's inflation has come close to the central bank's 2.0% target, the sticky services inflation (back above 4.0% annually in May) raised expectations that the ECB won't embark upon an aggressive easing cycle. Meanwhile, Eurozone annual inflation rose from 2.4% in April to 2.6% in May, beating the forecast for a 2.5% increase.\n\nFurther, a strong economic recovery and a tight labor market in the old continent will likely compel the ECB to refrain from committing to additional rate cuts in the meetings beyond June.\n\nLagarde could, therefore, stick to the Bank's data-dependent stance and avoid providing any guidance on the policy outlook.\n\n\"I think they will be far less prescriptive about what comes next than they have been around the June meeting,\" said BNP Paribas' chief Europe economist Paul Hollingsworth in a research note.\n\nMarkets are expecting fewer than 60 bps of cuts this year, implying two moves and less than a 50% chance of a third one. This is down from three rate cuts projected when the ECB last met in April and at least five rate cuts expected in 2024 in January, according to Reuters.\n\nHeading into the ECB showdown, the Euro is consolidating below a three-month top of 1.0916. The US Dollar (USD) struggles to sustain the upside momentum amid the revival of bets for a Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut in September after weak US ISM Manufacturing PMI data for May.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde's non-commital stance on the timing of the next rate cut could add extra legs to the EUR/USD recovery, as it would imply that the Bank could maintain rates higher for longer amid the persistence of inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, if Lagarde dismisses concerns about sticky inflation, it could be read as a bit dovish by market participants, eventually rendering negative for the EUR/USD pair.\n\nDhwani Mehta, FXStreet's Senior Analyst, offers a brief technical outlook for trading the Euro on the ECB policy announcements: \"EUR/USD extends its battle at around the stiff resistance near 1.0890, suggesting that buyers are gathering strength. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) holds strongly above the midline, near 60, adding credence to the pair's upside potential.\"\n\n\"Acceptance above the 1.0950 level is critical to unleashing further upside towards the 1.1000 psychological level. EUR buyers will then aim for the static resistance at 1.1050. Conversely, the initial demand area is seen around the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.0833, below which the 1.0800 support could be tested. The 100-day SMA aligns at that level. Further south, the confluence zone of the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA near 1.0775 could act as a tough nut to crack for Euro sellers,\" Dhwani adds.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BNP Paribas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Social_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Social Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacifism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Resources/Discover/Discover_29_1_Large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

makes first rate cut since 2019 but sees 'bumpy road'", "body": "The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the first time since 2019 on Thursday as eurozone inflation gradually eases, but president Christine Lagarde said the path ahead was unclear and warned of a \"bumpy road\".\n\nThe key deposit rate was lowered a quarter point to 3.75 percent, bringing it down from a record high.\n\nFollowing an unprecedented streak of eurozone rate hikes beginning in mid-2022 to tame runaway energy and food costs, inflation has been slowly coming down towards the ECB's two-percent target.\n\nThursday's cut, the first since September 2019, came after the central bank kept rates on hold since October and will provide a much-needed boost for the beleaguered eurozone economy.\n\nThe move marks the ECB diverging from the US Federal Reserve, which has also hiked rates aggressively but is not expected to start cutting for months due to stronger-than-expected data.\n\nAll eyes are on what happens next but the path ahead has been complicated by recent stronger-than-expected inflation and growth data, which has lowered the chances of a rapid easing cycle.\n\nAt a press conference following the rate decision, Lagarde insisted that the Frankfurt-based institution was not \"pre-committing to any particular rate path\".\n\n\"What is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take,\" she said. \"We know its going to be a bumpy road.\"\n\n- Sticky inflation -\n\nThe ECB's updated forecasts released Thursday highlighted the challenges.\n\nThe central bank hiked its inflation projections for this year and next, saying it no longer expects the indicator to hit the two-percent target in 2025, as previously anticipated, but rather to come in at 2.2 percent.\n\nIt also raised its growth forecast for 2024, although lowered it slightly for next year.\n\nIt came after data released last week showed inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose in May, and faster than expected -- to 2.6 percent on year.\n\nThe eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected in the first quarter as it emerged from recession.\n\nWhile inflation has eased, Lagarde noted that it still remained high, pointing to the fact that \"wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge.\"\n\nBut she also said that some indicators suggested that wage growth would ease over the course of the year.\n\nThe eurozone economy is expected to continue recovering, Lagarde said.\n\nBut she also warned of risks ranging from a weaker world economy to escalating trade tensions, and noted that the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are \"major sources of geopolitical risk\".\n\n- Divergence worries -\n\nWith data volatile and uncertainty clouding the horizon, the chances of another cut at the ECB's next meeting in July are now viewed as low.\n\nInstead, some analysts believe policymakers are hoping to reduce rates every other meeting -- so once a quarter, as the bank meets every six weeks -- at the same time as they release their regularly updated projections.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski believed the central bank could follow this path but also cautioned things could turn out differently.\n\n\"It wouldn't take a lot of negative inflation surprises for the ECB to tread more carefully or even reverse today's cut,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, stronger-than-expected data pushed back expectations of when the Fed -- which holds its next meeting on June 11-12 -- will begin reducing borrowing costs, fuelling speculation the ECB might also stay its hand.\n\nBut eurozone rate-setters have stressed they plot their own course.\n\nThere are nevertheless concerns about the ECB cutting faster than its US counterpart, as this could lead to a depreciation of the euro and fuel inflation by pushing up the cost of imports into the eurozone.\n\nFor the ECB, \"there may be some pauses on the way back down for rates in order to limit the scope of any divergence with the Federal Reserve,\" predicted Lindsay James, from Quilter Investors.\n\nsr/hmn/lth\n\nMore from this section\n\nImaget v2.0.0 Released: Bulk Download Images from URL List\n\nA Legacy of Excellence: HMF Express Marks 35 Years of Custom, Quick Ship Hollow

It cut its policy rates by 25bps, bringing the deposit rate from 4.0% to 3.75%. ECB assesses that the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission after nine months of holding rates steady, justifies to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction. However, despite the progress inflation, the ECB admits that domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated with inflation likely holding above target well into next year. Staff projections even were upwardly revised both headline (2024 2.5% from 2.3%; 2025 2.2% from 2.0%) and core (2024 2.8% from 2.6%, 2025 2.2% from 2.1%) inflation. Forecasts were left unchanged for 2026 (1.9 % headline; 2.0% core). Growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. Looking forward, the ECB commits to keep rates sufficiently restrictive as necessary to bring inflation to 2.0% in a timely manner. In a data-dependent approach, the bank doesn't commit to any particular rate path. The ECB continues to run-off of its APP portfolio and from H2 2024 will also reduce the PEPP portfolio by \u20ac 7.5 bln p/month as earlier announced. From a communication point of view, it wasn't that easy to explain less policy restriction as inflation is expected to stay longer above target than initially expected and as wage growth remains elevated. This complicates the pace/timing of further steps. EMU/German yields rebounded up to 5 bps after the release of the policy statement and this rise was maintained during Lagarde's press conference as the ECB Chair indicated that further easing needs the backing of data and that the ECB is not in in a phase of (automatically) dialing back. German yields currently rise between 6.0 bps (5-y) and 4.0 bps (30-y). Markets still see a 90% change of next step in September and about 70% of two additional cuts by the end of the year. US Treasuries outperform Bunts with yields adding about 1-2 bps across the curve. Jobless claims printed higher than expected at 229k and Q1 unit labour costs was substantially downwardly (4.0% from 4.7%) wiht markets looking forward to tomorrow's US payrolls. The ECB decision had little impact on EMU equities. EuroStoxx 50 still holds a 0.65% again. EUR/USD dropped to the 1.0865 area going into the ECB decision, but again trades near 1.088 as the timing of further cuts stays (highly) conditional. The rebound of the euro also helped EUR/GBP to create some breathing space from the key 0.8490/8500 support area (currently 0.8520).\n\nBritish CFO's in the Bank of England's Decision Maker Panel (DMP) for May expect output prices to rise 3.9% (three-month smoothed average) in the year ahead. That's slightly down from the 4% in the DMP's previous edition. Consumer price inflation for the upcoming year is seen rising 3% in the three months to May, easing further from the 3.1% in April. The gauge for three-year ahead CPI dropped further from 2.7% to 2.6% and should be welcomed by the Bank of England as it suggests the risk of unanchored inflation expectations so far does not materialize. Firms reported 1.5% employment growth in May, slower than the 1.7% in April as well as the slowest pace since November 2021. Employment growth for the year ahead is anticipated at 1.3%, the same as in April. Expected year-ahead wage growth fell by 0.3 ppts to 4.5% on a three-month moving-average basis in May.\n\nSticking to the UK, the central bank said it allotted more than \u00a319bn in its weekly repo operation on Thursday. That's up from \u00a317.2bn in the week before and the seventh straight week of record demand. The uptick is at least partially the result of the BoE's quantitative tightening programme through which it reduces excess liquidity in the market. Contrasting with the ECB and the Fed, the BoE sets an annual QT target in September for the year ahead and effectively sells gilts if bond expiries alone are not enough to hit that mark. The Bank of England is moving the fastest of all three, currently holding \u00a3700bn of bonds compared to a peak of <\u00a3900bn in early 2022. While the huge uptake could be viewed as signs of emerging liquidity scarcity, other metrics (e.g. minimal market repo rate premium over the Bank Rate) offer no reason to worry just yet. Moreover, the shift is exactly what the central bank wants. Its governor Bailey end May revealed the aim to provide liquidity the traditional way through repo's instead of (unconventional) QE in order to avoid interest rate risk.\n\nGerman 10-y yield holding

The rate statement also communicated that the ECB would not commit to a particular rate path following the cut and would still adopt a meeting-by-meeting approach while closely monitoring incoming data.\n\nThere was a marginal upside move in the euro (EUR) following the announcement, though this was largely expected as there was little edge for traders to exploit given the cut was baked in: a hawkish cut. Regarding market pricing, little change was seen after the rate announcement; the OIS market continued to price in another 25bp cut at September's policy-setting meeting.\n\nThe rate cut comes on the heels of an increase in inflation. The May inflation reported a rise for the euro area, following an acceleration in regional prints (Germany, Spain and France). According to the Flash estimate from Eurostat, euro area inflation increased to a four-month high.\n\nYear-on-year CPI (Consumer Price Index) for May inflation rose by +2.6% from +2.4% in April, bettering the +2.5% median estimate. Core inflation also rose above consensus at +2.9% from the prior +2.7% over the same period. The increase was largely due to a rise in services inflation, jumping +4.1% in the twelve months to May from +3.7% in April. Irrespective of the increase in inflation data, many desks believe this is not considered the start of an acceleration in inflation.\n\nThe rise in inflation, however, did see ECB staff raise inflation forecasts, though there was not really anything surprising here. According to the ECB forecasts, inflation is expected to average +2.5% this year, slow to +2.2% in 2025, and subsequently to +1.9% in 2026. In terms of economic activity, growth is expected to increase to +0.9% this year, +1.4% the following year, and moderate around +1.6% in 2026.", "source": {"uri": "fxempire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXEmpire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_hill@fxempire.com", "name": "Aaron Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurostat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/06/ECB2.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

That's put the ECB on course to loosen monetary policy before either the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, where the problem is proving more stubborn.\n\nWhere the ECB goes from here is unclear, with views becoming more cautious in the wake of data showing stronger-than-anticipated economic growth, inflation and wage increases. While most economists reckon there'll be three rate cuts this year, investors have pared back their expectations and are only fully pricing two.\n\nLagarde will discuss the situation at a 2:45 p.m. briefing in Frankfurt -- 30 minutes after the ECB's policy announcement.\n\nOfficials have fueled long-standing expectations of this week's 25 basis-point cut. Even hawkish Governing Council members like Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel and Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel have maintained that there are sufficient grounds for such a move.\n\nThat level of commitment has raised some eyebrows following the recent batch of economic reports.\n\n\"If they were consistent with their reaction function, they should actually be holding this week,\" said Soeren Radde, an economist at Point72. \"Which tells you that it's a political compromise they came up with.\"\n\nAnatoli Annenkov, an economist at Societe Generale, called the latest data \"not unambiguously supportive of policy easing, leaving a question mark as to why policymakers have been so focused on June, already since early this year.\"\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"The ECB will almost certainly lower rates by 25 basis points on June 6. The focus at the press conference is likely to be on what will happen in the months ahead. President Lagarde is unlikely to explicitly signal another move in July, but she may give a gentle nod to more action in September.\"\n\n-- David Powell, senior euro-area economist. Click here for full preview.\n\nSome have spoken out against a second straight cut in July, though Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau wants that option to remain available and Italy's Fabio Panetta argues that policy will remain tight even after several cuts.\n\nThe focus is increasingly on the quarterly meetings for which fresh economic projections are produced -- June, September and December -- because that's also when more of the relevant data on wages, corporate profits and productivity is available, as Dutch central-bank chief Klaas Knot has stated.\n\nNew Forecasts\n\nEconomists don't expect material shifts in this round of ECB forecasts, which they reckon will again show inflation returning to target in 2025. There may be an upward revision for growth this year, however, after first-quarter gross domestic product topped estimates.\n\nOne figure to watch is core inflation for 2026, which is currently seen at 2%. An increase may be taken as a signal that the bar for further monetary easing is high.\n\nAnother wrinkle is that these projections are put together by national central banks, alongside ECB staff. In the past, \"there has been a sense\" that this setup can lead to more hawkish outcomes, according to JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi.\n\nGlobal Backdrop\n\nWhile the ECB looked set to diverge from the Fed until recently, the stickiness of some inflation categories in Europe is prompting comparisons to the challenge faced by officials on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nUS policymakers have to had to rethink monetary loosening after price gains surpassed expectations, even if traders are still hopeful of a rate cut this year. The Bank of England is also unlikely to cut this month, while the Bank of Canada did so on Wednesday.\n\nWithin Europe but outside of the euro zone, Sweden's Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are among those to have already begun to ease policy.\n\n--With assistance from Joel Rinneby, Harumi Ichikura and Barbara Sladkowska.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

We've seen it from some of the smaller ones in emerging markets, but it is sort of a milestone when you get one of the big boys moving,\" said Eric Winograd, director of developed market economic research for AllianceBernstein. \"It is a foreshadowing of what we expect from other central banks.\"\n\nIndeed, investors remain anxious for the Federal Reserve to join the parade. As the year began, markets expected the Fed to lower rates seven times in 2024. But inflation, while down significantly from its mid-2022 peak, remains higher than the Fed's 2 percent target for price stability.\n\nAlmost no one expects the Fed to cut when its policymaking committee meets June 12. But there is a 70 percent chance of a Fed cut in September, according to CME FedWatch, which tracks investor bets in the futures market.\n\nEuropean interest rates have followed an extraordinary trajectory over the past decade. Amid chronic economic weakness, the ECB lowered its benchmark rate into negative territory in 2014 and held it there until the post-pandemic surge of inflation. Then European monetary authorities raised rates nine times, eventually reaching a record high of 4 percent in September.\n\nEurope's inflation problem in recent years was largely driven by higher energy prices, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Those costs have ebbed. But growth in the 20-nation euro zone has lagged. Since the start of 2022, the size of the U.S. economy has grown by 4.7 percent compared with just 1.7 percent in Europe, according to TD Securities.\n\nECB officials are likely to pause before implementing additional rate cuts, according to Jacob Kirkegaard, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"They'll wait and see -- possibly cut in September, possibly cut three times in 2024,\" he said.\n\nThe ECB action came one day after the Bank of Canada became the first member of the Group of 7 democracies to lower rates. In its first cut since 2020, the Canadian central bank dropped its policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 4.75 percent.\n\n\"We've come a long way in the fight against inflation,\" said Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada.\n\nFurther rate cuts are likely if inflation continues to decline. But progress in eradicating inflation is likely to be \"uneven,\" Macklem said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_j_lynch@washingtonpost.com", "name": "David J.

It is a payment that has risen substantially for many over the last two years thanks to those interest rate increases from the ECB.\n\nIn the 12 months to April, mortgage interest payments in Ireland grew by 21% according to the Central Statistics Office. That was on top of a 41% increase between April 2022 and April 2023. A clear demonstration of how interest rate hikes hurt mortgage holders.\n\nBut from today a change is coming. Right now the ECB's deposit rate is 4%. That is expected to drop to 3.75% following the bank's governing council June monetary policy meeting taking place in Frankfurt. It will have an immediate knock-on effect on the banks main refinance rate of 4.5%.\n\nIt is a cut that has been well signaled in advance by senior members of the bank including President Christine Lagarde and ECB Chief Economist, and former governor of the Irish Central Bank Phillip Lane.\n\nMr Lane spoke of the impeding cut in a recent speech at the IIEA in Dublin.\n\n\"It has been reasonable for us in the last few weeks to basically signal that barring major surprises, many people on the Governing Council, including myself this morning, have indicated there may be enough in the data to say we can remove the top layer of restrictiveness.\"\n\nSo now the day has arrived what can mortgage holders expect? Those on trackers will immediately feel the benefit according to Martina Hennessy, CEO of mortgage sales and switching website doddl.ie.\n\n\"It is widely expected that the ECB will announce a 0.25% rate reduction this Thursday. This will offer some relief to tracker mortgage holders, resulting in a decrease in monthly repayments by just over \u20ac13 per month for every \u20ac100,000 outstanding over a 15-year term.\"\n\nThat's a cool saving of \u20ac470 per annum for a tracker holder who borrowed \u20ac300,000 and will be welcome news. However, payments on that mortgage are still \u20ac4,000 higher per annum than they were in 2021.\n\nThe picture for non-tracker mortgage holders will be more nuanced. Many who have mortgages with pillar lenders did not see all of the rate increases passed on over the last two years. It could be the same with rate reductions according to Joey Sheahan Head of Credit with mymortgages.ie.\n\n\"Borrowers with fixed and variable rate mortgages have rates that are not directly linked to the ECB rates. However, the overall cost of funds for all banks will be reduced and we would anticipate there will be downward pressure on all rates,\" he said.\n\nRegarding non-bank lenders in the Irish market, some of whom charge interest of up to 7%, Mr Sheahan said they were more directly affected when the ECB rates increased, so the rate reduction will take pressure off them.\n\n\"They should hopefully be able to pass this saving to customers,\" he said.\n\nWhatever decisions lenders take on the back of todays ECB decision, it will likely be closely watched by the Government. Both Taoiseach Simon Harris and Minister for Finance Michael McGrath have already publicly urged the banks to pass on savings to hard pressed mortgage holders still struggling with their costs.\n\nWhile today's cut now seems to be a certainty, the question of further cuts immediately arises. The ECB's stated aim of getting inflation back to 2% is close to being achieved. Inflation in the Eurozone in April was 2.4% . Although governing council members remain wary about committing to anything beyond today's change, there is an expectation that further are on the cards.\n\nConall Mac Coille, Chief Economist with Bank of Ireland said: \"Market expectation is for one or two further cuts by the end of the year, ending up at 3.25% or 3.5%\n\n\"We are leaning towards 3 rate cuts in total, Thursdays, and two more by year end,\" he said.\n\n\"Inflation looks to be on the way down but the ECB could still take a cautious approach, particularly if service prices inflation remains persistently high.\"\n\nMartina Hennessy agrees.\n\n\"The ECB is set to remain cautious in its approach to reducing rates, continuing to monitor inflation closely. Further meetings of the European Monetary Policy Committee are scheduled for September and December where they will review inflation data and the impact of the June reduction.\"", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_mag_raollaigh@rte.ie", "name": "Joe Mag Raollaigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Statistics_Office_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Statistics Office (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McGrath_(Irish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael McGrath (Irish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Ireland", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Finance_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Finance (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Harris_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simon Harris (politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/001f507a-1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Forecasters expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September, Reuters reported.\n\nEuropean Central Bank president Christine Lagarde was \"wise\" to keep the organization's cards close and not commit to any future cuts given recent swings in inflation in the Eurozone and global economic uncertainty, the Financial Times said in an editorial. It's \"clearly far too early,\" to make deeper interest rate cuts, one global finance analyst told the Guardian. That said, the ECB's decision to ease rates \"will breathe life into an economy that desperately needs some form of stimulus,\" an investment strategist told the BBC. The Eurozone languishes behind the US and China in terms of growth, productivity, and bloated public finances, Bloomberg noted If these issues go unresolved, the region \"risks sliding ever further into irrelevance,\" the outlet added.\n\nThe ECB's decision puts it ahead of the US Federal Reserve, but transatlantic differences in inflation and growth may justify the relative haste, an economist told the Associated Press. But further rate reductions by both the ECB and Bank of Canada \"could well be prematurely curtailed\" by worries over how the markets will respond if the Fed delays easing, a Bloomberg columnist argued. \"The Fed usually takes the lead on rate policy and the ECB will be hesitant to cut twice ahead of the Fed, as this could weaken the euro and send inflation higher,\" a market analyst wrote in MarketPulse.\n\nThe overall increase in interest rates by central banks since 2022 has had a \"direct impact\" on developing countries' budgets which peg their debt to the dollar or the euro. Their debt growth rate is now double that of developed countries. One in three developing countries are now spending more on debt-servicing interest payments than on crucial areas like health, education, and climate action, according to a UN report released on Wednesday. Countries that service their debt in dollars have \"widely suffered\" from higher interest rates, a fellow at the London School of Economics told Al Jazeera, and may face the \"one-two\" punch of also having their currencies depreciate, campaign group ONE Against Poverty argued.

The step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nWhile Lagarde last month declared inflation \"under control,\" a string of recent data has pointed to enduring price pressures. That's prompted investors and economists to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024 to two or three in total.\n\nMoney markets held onto bets that the next cut will probably be in September. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.0880 and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55%.\n\nAn updated quarterly outlook published alongside the ECB's policy statement forecasts inflation averaging 2.2% in 2025, up from 2% before, with this year's projection for economic expansion lifted to 0.9% from 0.6%.\n\nLagarde said price growth will slow toward the 2% goal later than previously thought.\n\n\"Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year,\" she said. \"It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next year.\"\n\nWhile the higher inflation revisions aren't a surprise, \"they add to the sticky inflation story that may limit the room for additional rate cuts,\" said Theophile Legrand, a rates strategist at Natixis SA.\n\nThe run-up to Thursday's meeting saw policymakers leave little room for doubt in their intention to lower rates -- even after some of the economic numbers they'd hoped would back their case moved in the wrong direction.\n\nInflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, with a gauge of underlying trends also wrong-footing analysts by edging higher. Elsewhere, wage rises failed to moderate in the first quarter -- suggesting elevated growth in services prices will persist. Another crucial measure of pay is due Friday and may paint a similar picture.\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, has bounced back more forcefully than expected from its malaise. Aside from the outperformance in growth, unemployment hit an all-time low in April and the troubled manufacturing sector is finally showing signs of life.\n\nLagarde said risks to the economy are balanced in the near term, with the recovery to continue thanks to stronger exports and services, alongside looser monetary policy.\n\nECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has said inflation and wage gains will \"bounce around\" this year, even as the general trend is for them to abate. Policy must continue to restrict activity throughout 2024, he says.\n\nWhile the ECB has now cut before both the Fed and the BOE, which are grappling with more stubborn price pressures and are only expected to follow suit in the coming months, counterparts in other parts of the world have already started easing.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate on Wednesday and said more moves may come -- becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to do so since the biggest global inflation shock since the 1970s erupted. In Europe, Sweden's Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are among those to have already eased.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natixis", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natixis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u20132023_inflation_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021\u20132023 inflation surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_Riksbank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sveriges Riksbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swiss National Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/412496480.jpg?w=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

approximately \u20ac402 a year in interest rates.\n\nWhile this is good news for mortgage holders who have been hit hard by the increase in mortgage interest rates, those with non-tracker mortgages who mightn't have seen their interest rates increase may also not see their interest rates decrease.\n\nIt was reported back in March that the ECB were not yet 'sufficiently confident' on reducing interest rates towards its 2% goal, but ECB President Christine Legarde added that they were 'making good progress towards our inflation target.'\n\nEY Ireland chief economist Dr Loretta O'Sullivan said the outcome of the ECB meeting in March was 'in line with expectations,' adding: 'Timing wise, the summer looks more likely [for an interest rate cut] than April at this point, partly because more wage data will be available by then.'", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/European-Central-Bank-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 367}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Even in the euro zone, the outlook for further decreasing rates has become noticeably gloomier. Inflation will be the decisive factor.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) Council to decide on a first rate cut by 25 basis points at its meeting today is still expected by the vast majority of economists. However, the warning signals from the ECB's environment in recent weeks have also changed expectations for further rate decisions this year.\n\nIt is no longer taken for granted that the ECB will return from the current level of 4.5 percent with each regular meeting.\n\nThis is likely to initiate the phase of normalization. This is made possible by the decreased inflation and the need to give the economy more breathing room again. However, how steep the rate cut path will be and where the endpoint of the cuts will lie, has become more uncertain again. Recently, inflation has picked up slightly, and price increases in the service sector have also exceeded expectations. On the other hand, the labor market situation in the euro zone has brightened, and there are signs of an economic revival.\n\nFed Rate Cut Still Distant\n\nSome analysts believe that the diminished hopes for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) could also spill over to Europe. The inflation trend in the euro zone shows a clear correlation with that in the USA, but with a two to three-month delay.\n\n\"America's troubles with sticky inflation could yet wash up on European shores,\" ING economist Carsten Brzeski is quoted by the news agency \"Bloomberg.\" \"The ECB would be well-advised not to categorically reject the risk of reflation witnessed in the US and to remain cautious.\"\n\nKonstantin Veit of Pimco also sees a connection. \"So if the US turns out to have a bigger problem, it's unlikely that the euro zone doesn't have at least a minor one.\"\n\nDifferent Inflation Drivers\n\nHowever, the economic situation in Europe and the USA differs significantly. While in America inflation is driven by the economy, the strong labor market, and rising wages, in Europe it was primarily the energy price shock following Russia's attack on Ukraine in the spring of 2022.\n\n\"The cause of US inflation hasn't yet been resolved,\" says Holger Schmieding, Chief Economist at Berenberg Bank. \"Domestic final demand continues to grow strongly. In the euro zone, however, the Putin shock has largely been overcome. Here, however, the economy is weakening.

In addition, GDP growth forecasts expect GDP to rise 0.9% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2026. The move, anticipated by money markets, marks the first cut since September 2019, when the deposit facility entered negative territory.\n\nThe unanimous decision to cut rates was made by all 20 national representatives, with ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasizing the data-driven nature of their approach. She stressed that decisions would be made meeting by meeting.\n\nLagarde revealed that while there was unanimous agreement on the data-driven path, one member abstained from voting. However, she did not disclose their identity. The governing council reasserted their commitment to analyze the inflation outlook, underlying inflation, and monetary policy transmission.\n\nFollowing the announcement, market expectations revolve around potential further rate cuts. Notably, economists predict two more cuts in the near future. This decision aligns with a broader global trend, as the Bank of Canada recently became the first major central bank to reduce interest rates this year, prompting speculations of a similar move by the ECB.\n\nIn addition to these macroeconomic conditions in the European Union, analysts at QCP Capital suggest that today's U.S. jobless claims report and the upcoming CPI release could potentially drive Bitcoin to new all-time highs.\n\nQCP Capital further asserts that market momentum might intensify if potential rate cuts are factored into the equation.

Lower rates could spur more business activity, boosting demand for materials like copper and softening USD, which also bolsters commodities.\n\n--\n\nIron ore prices edged higher in a possible technical rebound after a recent drop due to signs of weak demand from China. However, bearish sentiment may persist as the strength of China demand remains uncertain, ANZ research analysts said.\n\nTODAY'S TOP HEADLINES\n\nECB Poised to Beat Fed to Rate-Cut Punch. Why the Timing Is Awkward.\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely expected to get ahead of the Federal Reserve on Thursday and deliver its first interest-rate cut since the Covid-19 pandemic unleashed a surge of inflation.\n\nIt won't be the first central bank to cut since-Canada pulled the trigger on a reduction Wednesday, and Switzerland and Sweden moved earlier this year.\n\nBank of Canada Cuts Rates to Become First G-7 Central Bank to Ease Policy\n\nOTTAWA-The Bank of Canada cut its main interest rate by a quarter percentage point, becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to provide rate relief after global policymakers aggressively increased borrowing costs to tame inflation.\n\nCanada's central bank said a cut was warranted because officials are now increasingly confident that inflation is moving closer to their 2% target. Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said more rate cuts could be in the offing should inflation show further signs of slowing, though he added the pace of reductions would likely be gradual. He also warned households, businesses and governments that rates are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nEurope's Ascendant Right-Wing Parties Want to Remake the EU. They Can't Agree How.\n\nRight-wing nationalist parties look set to surge in elections across Europe this week, but the shock wave will travel slowly due to rifts among the political forces.\n\nMany of the parties see former President Donald Trump as a model. They pledge to peel back Brussels' power and shift European Union policy on hot-button issues including migration and climate policies.\n\nIsraeli Nationalists, Marching in Jerusalem, Balk at U.S. Cease-Fire Push\n\nJERUSALEM-The marchers waved Israeli flags alongside flags of religious seminaries and banners in support of Donald Trump. Some chanted \"Death to Arabs,\" while others called for tearing down the Al Aqsa Mosque in the heart of this ancient city and rebuilding an ancient Jewish temple in its place.\n\nThis year, the young religious nationalists at Israel's annual flag march also called for carrying on the war against Hamas in Gaza, rejecting President Biden's push for a cease-fire that could save some Israeli hostages but might help Hamas to survive.\n\nHow Apple Fell Behind in the AI Arms Race\n\nFor those who saw them, the demonstrations inside Apple earlier this decade of a revamped Siri offered a showcase of the amazing capabilities a powerful AI voice assistant could have.\n\nThe famed assistant, one of the last projects Apple co-founder Steve Jobs worked on before his death, had been given a total overhaul. Capable of running on an iPhone and without an internet connection, the new Siri impressed people with its improved speed, conversational capabilities and the accuracy with which it understood user commands. Code-named Project Blackbird, the effort also imagined a Siri with capabilities built by third-party app developers, according to people familiar with the work.\n\nNvidia Reaches $3 Trillion Market Value. It's the Latest Sign of Chip Demand.\n\nNvidia shares hit a historic milestone Wednesday afternoon, closing above $3 trillion in market value for the first time. It's the third U.S. company to do so, after Apple and Microsoft.\n\nNvidia has benefited from expectations for its next generation of artificial-intelligence chips. Both Tesla and Hewlett Packard Enterprise executives called out the chip maker as the dominant supplier in the AI boom.\n\nElon Musk's xAI Plans to Build Supercomputer in Memphis\n\nElon Musk's startup xAI is planning to build a supercomputer in Memphis, Tenn., as the young company races to catch up to rivals that have had yearslong head starts developing generative AI.\n\nTerms weren't disclosed. The amount of the investment is still being finalized, according to Ted Townsend, president of the city's chamber of commerce. The project, which would be housed at an old manufacturing facility, still needs approval of local and regional authorities.\n\nAll times in GMT.

With the markets fully expecting a 0.25% rate cut from the ECB, in what would be it's first rate cut since 2019, there will be implications for investment managers whichever way they decide to go.\n\nCommenting on the interest rate outlook, Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said: \"Markets are poised for a pivotal day as the ECB is widely expected to initiate its rate cutting cycle with a first quarter point cut. The Bank of Canada has already stolen a march by reducing its lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75%, hinting at potential further cuts after inflation fell to 2.7%, a level which still exceeds the rate of inflation in both the UK and Eurozone.\n\n\"With the risk of central bank divergence seemingly dissipating, as expectations for rate cuts in 2024 in the US have been growing in recent days and economic data has suggested that inflation is being tamed as growth is beginning to slow, this may be adding to the confidence of central bankers outside of the US to make their move, with less concern about ensuing currency risks or capital flows.\n\n\"Data out in the US yesterday underlined this point, with the ISM Services PMI Report on Business highlighting contractionary employment conditions and a slowing pace of input cost inflation. On the flip side, activity in the services sector beat expectations, with economic activity growing again in May after an initial contraction in April. This reflects an acceleration in new orders, in sharp contrast to the apparent weakness reflected in the Manufacturing survey, which remains in contractionary territory.\n\n\"In encouraging signs for the UK economy, the British Chambers of Commerce updated its growth forecasts for this year to 0.8% from an earlier prediction of 0.5%, and to 1% in 2025 from 0.7%. This is likely to be mirrored by other economic forecasters in time due to the better than expected data out in Q1 when the economy emerged from recession with quarter on quarter growth of 0.6%, amidst signs of strength coming from sectors including transportation and the scientific research as well as the retail sector. While poor weather in Q2 may dampen this contributor to an extent, with retail sales volumes reportedly having fallen 2.3% in April following a fall of 0.2% in March, a more optimistic mood through the coming months, potentially buoyed by political promises, a summer of sport and most importantly the prospect of lower interest rates could see the UK economy again beat low expectations.\"\n\nAlso sharing his thoughts ahead of the ECB decision later today, Dave Chappell, Senior Fund Manager, Fixed Income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said: \"Had the ECB not telegraphed the rate cut this week so emphatically, we believe that there would have been a heated debate around whether to wait for more data following the less than supportive wage and inflation prints over the last couple of weeks. It is highly likely that Lagarde will guide markets to a hold at July, with the next adjustment either in September or October.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sue_whitbread@ifamagazine.com", "name": "Sue Whitbread", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Globe and Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Threadneedle_Investments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Threadneedle Investments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Chambers_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Chambers of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ifamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ECB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Having kept it at 4% for nine months, they said the inflation outlook has improved \"markedly,\" though they also raised projections for prices.\n\n\"The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nThe decision begins to roll back the unprecedented barrage of hikes deployed to quell the euro zone's worst-ever spike in prices. The step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nWhile Lagarde last month declared inflation \"under control,\" a string of recent data has pointed to enduring price pressures. That's prompted investors and economists to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024 to two or three in total.\n\nMoney markets held onto bets that the next cut will probably be in September. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.0880 and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55%.\n\nAn updated quarterly outlook published alongside the ECB's policy statement forecasts inflation averaging 2.2% in 2025, with this year's projection for economic expansion lifted to 0.9% from 0.6% before.\n\nLagarde will hold a news conference at 2:45 p.m. in Frankfurt to elaborate on the ECB's decisions.\n\nThe run-up to Thursday's meeting saw policymakers leave little room for doubt in their intention to lower rates -- even after some of the economic numbers they'd hoped would back their case moved in the wrong direction.\n\nInflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, with a gauge of underlying trends also wrong-footing analysts by edging higher. Elsewhere, wage rises failed to moderate in the first quarter -- suggesting elevated growth in services prices will persist. Another crucial measure of pay is due Friday and may paint a similar picture.\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, has bounced back more forcefully than expected from its malaise. Aside from the outperformance in growth, unemployment hit an all-time low in April and the troubled manufacturing sector is finally showing signs of life.\n\nECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has said inflation and wage gains will \"bounce around\" this year, even as the general trend is for them to abate. Policy must continue to restrict activity throughout 2024, he says.\n\nWhile the ECB has now cut before both the Fed and the BOE, which are grappling with more stubborn price pressures and are only expected to follow suit in the coming months, counterparts in other parts of the world have already started easing.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate on Wednesday and said more moves may come -- becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to do so since the biggest global inflation shock since the 1970s erupted. In Europe, Sweden's Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are among those to have already eased.\n\n--With assistance from Adam Blenford, Barbara Sladkowska, Harumi Ichikura, Joel Rinneby, Lizzy

Crypto industry experts shared with Crypto Briefing that this movement is important for different reasons, as it raises important questions about stablecoins in the European Union and the demand for Bitcoin in the Eurozone.\n\nAurelie Barthere, Principal Research analyst at Nansen, explained that the ECB's rate cut was already priced in by the markets, so investors shouldn't have surprises.\n\n\"In general, the ECB has less influence than the Fed on crypto markets, and the ECB follows the Fed, not the other way around. The reason why the ECB cut earlier than the Fed is the weakness of growth in the Eurozone vs the US,\" Barthere added.\n\nAs reported by BBC, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB said the outlook for inflation had improved \"markedly\", paving the way for the rate cut. Yet, Lagarde warned investors to keep their hopes in check, as inflation might average 2.5% in 2024, and the ECB would keep interest rate policy \"sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary.\"\n\nNevertheless, the ECB decision might benefit the crypto market indirectly, highlighted Eneko Kn\u00f6rr, CEO of Stabolut. \"While European economic policies might not have a direct influence on global crypto trends, lower interest rates generally drive investors toward higher-risk, higher-return assets,\" he explained.\n\nAs a result, crypto might become more attractive as investors seek better yields. Therefore, the rate cut could boost interest in crypto as part of a broader search for higher returns.\n\nMoreover, Bitfinex analysts assessed that this move aims to stimulate economic growth amid signs of a slowdown in the Eurozone, although this might weaken the euro. This is good news for crypto, as investors in the European Union could ramp up their demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. \"The increased liquidity from this monetary easing could also support risk assets, including crypto.\"\n\nKevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, is also keen to believe that the rate cuts are a bullish signal for markets with higher risks and potential returns. Additionally, the stablecoin sector in the Eurozone might witness a significant impact.\n\n\"This move raises important questions about the future of EURO stablecoins, especially in light of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation coming into effect in June. The rate cut could significantly impact the financial outlook for EURO stablecoin issuers.\"\n\nWeighing if this decision affects the FOMC meeting next week in the US, Kn\u00f6rr stated that the Fed decisions are largely irrelevant to ECB actions, and vice-versa. However, the ECB's rate cut might signal to markets that inflation concerns may be easing.", "source": {"uri": "cryptobriefing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Briefing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gino_matos@cryptobriefing.com", "name": "Gino Matos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitfinex"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06134324/img-X0GCHi5f0DF65N0bxEqEyQvy-800x457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

US Dollar wobbles on mixed signals, Eurozone inflation complicates ECB plans.\n\nCentral banks on opposite sides of the Atlantic are facing very different situations. The European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to cut interest rates this week due to concerns about slowing economic growth in the Eurozone. Inflation, however, remains stubbornly high, creating a dilemma for policymakers. The recent weakness in manufacturing and exports is adding pressure on the ECB to act. President Draghi's comments have signaled a dovish bias, suggesting multiple rate cuts could be on the table.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) is taking a more cautious approach. Recent disappointing economic data, like lower-than-expected job growth figures, has raised concerns about a slowdown. This has shifted market expectations towards a potential rate cut by the Fed in September. However, the Fed is likely to wait and see how upcoming data unfolds. Strong data could lead them to hold rates steady, while further weakness could trigger a cut. Additionally, some market participants still believe the Fed may hold off due to a perceived normalization in the labor market, potentially easing upward pressure on inflation. This uncertainty is causing volatility in financial markets.\n\nUS Dollar: Uncertain Path Forward\n\nThe US Dollar's recent performance has been a rollercoaster ride. Initially, the currency weakened on the back of weak economic indicators in the US. However, a surprise surge in the US ISM Services PMI data, which measures activity in the service sector, boosted the Dollar. This suggests that a key part of the US economy remains healthy, potentially offsetting weakness in manufacturing. Looking ahead, the future direction of the US Dollar remains unclear. Potential rate cuts from the Fed could weaken the Dollar, but continued strength in the service sector could provide support. This mixed picture is likely to lead to continued volatility in the foreign exchange market.\n\nEurozone Inflation Throws a Curveball\n\nThe ECB's plans for easier monetary policy have been complicated by unexpectedly high inflation in the Eurozone. This inflation spike is above the ECB's target, making it difficult for them to cut rates aggressively as they originally intended. The higher inflation puts the ECB in a balancing act - they want to support slowing growth but also control inflation. This could lead them to take a more cautious approach to rate cuts compared to earlier expectations. The need to address inflation might even result in a slight hawkish tilt in ECB policy, meaning they may be less dovish than previously anticipated.\n\nTop 5 Economic Releases for This Week (June 5th to June 8th):\n\nThe subject matter and the content of this article are solely the views of the author.

U.S. economy slowdown is expected in 2024, suggesting the Fed should also be cautious with rate cuts. The ECB joins other central banks in unwinding post-pandemic rate hikes.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that the European Central Bank's rate cut is \"appropriate\" given declining inflation in the euro area, but that both ECB and Federal Reserve policy makers should maintain a data-dependent approach. IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack also told a regular news briefing that the U.S. economy needs to slow in 2024 and the Fed should remain cautious in cutting rates.\n\nThe ECB on Thursday cut interest rates for the first time in five years, joining the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in starting to unwind some of the steepest rate hikes used to tame a post-pandemic inflation surge. But it kept investors in the dark about its next move. \"Like in the U.S., we have seen significant progress in reducing inflation in Europe. We assess that ECB policy is appropriate,\" Kozack said, adding that the IMF previously recommended ECB cuts starting in June.\n\n\"But it's also important for the ECB to maintain its data dependent approach and its meeting by meeting approach,\" she added. Kozack said the U.S. economy has proven \"remarkably resilient\" in the face of tight monetary policy and economic shocks, with strong domestic demand despite slower first quarter GDP data.\n\n\"Inflation data for the first quarter has been overall higher than we would like to see in the US. And it's a reminder that there are going to be bumps on the road as the US strives to bring inflation back to target,\" Kozack said. \"This also reinforces the need for the Fed to be cautious and data dependent on deciding policy in the in the coming months.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u20132023_inflation_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021\u20132023 inflation surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_06_2024_09_31_45_6845924.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Having kept it at 4% for nine months, they said the inflation outlook has improved \"markedly,\" though they also raised projections for prices.\n\n\"The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nThe decision begins to roll back the unprecedented barrage of hikes deployed to quell the euro zone's worst-ever spike in prices. The step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nWhile Lagarde last month declared inflation \"under control,\" a string of recent data has pointed to enduring price pressures. That's prompted investors and economists to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024 to two or three in total.\n\nMoney markets held onto bets that the next cut will probably be in September. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.0880 and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55%.\n\nAn updated quarterly outlook published alongside the ECB's policy statement forecasts inflation averaging 2.2% in 2025, with this year's projection for economic expansion lifted to 0.9% from 0.6% before.\n\nLagarde will hold a news conference at 2:45 p.m. in Frankfurt to elaborate on the ECB's decisions.\n\nThe run-up to Thursday's meeting saw policymakers leave little room for doubt in their intention to lower rates -- even after some of the economic numbers they'd hoped would back their case moved in the wrong direction.\n\nInflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, with a gauge of underlying trends also wrong-footing analysts by edging higher. Elsewhere, wage rises failed to moderate in the first quarter -- suggesting elevated growth in services prices will persist. Another crucial measure of pay is due Friday and may paint a similar picture.\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, has bounced back more forcefully than expected from its malaise. Aside from the outperformance in growth, unemployment hit an all-time low in April and the troubled manufacturing sector is finally showing signs of life.\n\nECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has said inflation and wage gains will \"bounce around\" this year, even as the general trend is for them to abate. Policy must continue to restrict activity throughout 2024, he says.\n\nWhile the ECB has now cut before both the Fed and the BOE, which are grappling with more stubborn price pressures and are only expected to follow suit in the coming months, counterparts in other parts of the world have already started easing.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate on Wednesday and said more moves may come -- becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to do so since the biggest global inflation shock since the 1970s erupted. In Europe, Sweden's Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are among those to have already eased.\n\n--With assistance from Adam Blenford, Barbara Sladkowska, Harumi Ichikura, Joel Rinneby, Lizzy Burden, Max Ramsay, Greg Ritchie, William Horobin, Jasmina Kuzmanovic, Alessandra Migliaccio, Irina Anghel, Christoph Rauwald, Angela Cullen, Laura Malsch, Laura Alvi\u017e, Alexey Anishchuk, James Regan, Phil Serafino and Fergal O'Brien.\n\n(Updates with market reaction in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This positive momentum extended to Asian markets, where shares rose amidst growing expectations of a forthcoming interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in September. Oil prices also saw an uptick during early Asian trading, rebounding from recent declines attributed to increased US inventories and plans by OPEC+ to boost oil supply. Meanwhile, gold prices edged higher in anticipation of US payroll data. Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world's second most valuable company. Following Canada's lead in cutting interest rates, the European Central Bank (ECB) is anticipated to follow suit as it continues its fight against inflation. Lululemon's shares surged following optimistic full-year guidance. Today, all eyes are on the ECB as it is expected to announce a reduction in interest rates from historic highs. Before the ECB's decision, economic data including construction PMI figures from the UK, Eurozone, and Germany will be released. Additionally, investors will closely watch Friday's US nonfarm payroll report for May. The FTSE 100 closed higher on Wednesday, with futures suggesting a positive opening for Thursday. Here are five key takeaways for your day.\n\nNvidia surpasses Apple to claim second spot in market value rankings\n\nNvidia, a chipmaker, achieved a significant milestone by reaching a market value of $3 trillion for the first time. Its shares surged over 5 per cent, surpassing Apple to become the world's second most valuable company. Nvidia is set to split its stock ten-for-one starting June 7, a move aimed at making its shares more accessible to individual investors. This development marks a notable shift in Silicon Valley, which has long been dominated by Apple since the launch of the iPhone in 2007.\n\nNvidia's stock closed the day at $1,224.40, marking a 5.2 per cent increase and resulting in a market capitalization of $3.012 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple's market capitalization reached $3.003 trillion after its stock rose by 0.8 per cent. The positive momentum extended to other tech giants, driving the Nasdaq Composite index up by nearly 2 per cent, while the broader S&P 500 also rose by 1.2 per cent during the trading session.\n\nECB poised for rate cut following Canada's G7 rate reduction\n\nAfter Canada led the way as the first G7 nation to lower interest rates, all eyes turned to the European Central Bank (ECB), which seemed poised to follow suit by cutting rates from their historic highs on Thursday. It was widely anticipated that the ECB would acknowledge progress in tackling high inflation while emphasizing that the battle was far from over.\n\nEconomists and market observers were expecting the ECB to trim its deposit rate to 3.75 per cent from the current record of 4.0 per cent, marking the first rate cut since 2019. This move came as ECB policymakers signalled their intention to reduce borrowing costs, responding to a decline in inflation across the eurozone from over 10 per cent in late 2022 to slightly above their 2 per cent target in recent months.\n\nLululemon's bullish full-year outlook sparks share surge\n\nLululemon shares jumped over 10 per cent in after-hours trading after the company forecasted full-year earnings of $14.27 to $14.47 per share and revenues up to $10.8 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations. First-quarter results also beat predictions with revenue up 10.4 per cent and earnings per share up 11.4 per cent. In contrast, Five Below shares fell over 14 per cent due to a disappointing sales outlook.\n\nWhat's coming up\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to lower interest rates from their historic highs on Thursday. ECB President Christine Lagarde confirmed in a press conference will be closely watched. While they will likely note progress in tackling inflation, they are expected to highlight that the fight against rising prices is ongoing.\n\nInvestors will be keenly observing the ECB's statements and economic forecasts to understand the next steps after the rate cut. Currently, markets are predicting a total of 64 basis points of cuts this year.\n\nBefore the ECB's decision, Thursday's economic updates include construction PMI data from the UK, the Eurozone, and Germany. After the ECB announcement, the focus will shift to the nonfarm payroll report for May, with economists forecasting a job increase of 185,000.\n\nAsian stocks surge amid growing rate cut speculation\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.25 per cent to 38,807.33, while the S&P 500 climbed 1.18 per cent to 5,354.03, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.96 per cent to 17,187.91. Technology stocks were the biggest drivers of the S&P 500's gains, followed by the communications and industrials sectors. In contrast, consumer staples stocks saw the most significant declines.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise saw a 10.7 per cent increase after forecasting third-quarter revenue above expectations due to strong demand for its AI servers. Meanwhile, Dollar Tree dropped 4.9 per cent following a disappointing profit forecast, with the retailer considering options like selling or spinning off Family Dollar.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose by 1 per cent, China's blue-chip CSI300 index increased by 0.38 per cent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index went up by 0.81 per cent.\n\nThe FTSE 100 in Britain closed higher, supported by economic data that strengthened expectations for a September rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. Futures point to a positive start for Thursday, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures up 1.66 per cent and FTSE 100 futures rising 0.29 per cent to 8286.5. In the US, S&P 500 futures saw a 0.08 per cent increase, and Nasdaq futures went up by 0.14 per cent.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures rose 0.48 per cent to $78.79 per barrel, and US West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed 0.66 per cent to $74.55 per barrel.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivek_kumar@cityam.com", "name":

Having held it at 4% for nine months, they said the inflation outlook has improved \"markedly,\" though they'll \"keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" after also raising projections for prices.\n\n\"Are we today moving into a dialing-back phase? I wouldn't volunteer that,\" Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt. \"There's a strong likelihood but it will be data dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take.\"\n\nThe Governing Council pledged to continue adhering to a meeting-by-meeting approach, saying it isn't \"pre-committing to a particular rate path.\" The rate cut was unanimous, except for one governor, according to Lagarde.\n\nThe decision begins to roll back the unprecedented barrage of hikes deployed to quell the euro zone's worst-ever spike in prices. The step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nWhile Lagarde last month declared inflation \"under control,\" a string of recent data has pointed to enduring price pressures. That's prompted investors and economists to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024 to two or three in total.\n\nMoney markets held onto bets that the next cut will probably be in September. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.0880 and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55%.\n\nAn updated quarterly outlook published alongside the ECB's policy statement forecasts inflation averaging 2.2% in 2025, up from 2% before, with this year's projection for economic expansion lifted to 0.9% from 0.6%.\n\nLagarde said price growth will slow toward the 2% goal later than previously thought.\n\n\"Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year,\" she said. \"It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next year.\"\n\nWhile the higher inflation revisions aren't a surprise, \"they add to the sticky inflation story that may limit the room for additional rate cuts,\" said Theophile Legrand, a rates strategist at Natixis SA.\n\nThe run-up to Thursday's meeting saw policymakers leave little room for doubt in their intention to lower rates -- even after some of the economic numbers they'd hoped would back their case moved in the wrong direction.\n\nInflation, for one, quickened more than anticipated in May, with a gauge of underlying trends also wrong-footing analysts by edging higher. Elsewhere, wage rises failed to moderate in the first quarter -- suggesting elevated growth in services prices will persist. Another crucial measure of pay is due Friday and may paint a similar picture.\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, has bounced back more forcefully than expected from its malaise. Aside from the outperformance in growth, unemployment hit an all-time low in April and the troubled manufacturing sector is finally showing signs of life.\n\nLagarde said risks to the economy are balanced in the near term, with the recovery to continue thanks to stronger exports and services, alongside looser monetary policy.\n\nECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has said inflation and wage gains will \"bounce around\" this year, even as the general trend is for them to abate. Policy must continue to restrict activity throughout 2024, he says.\n\nWhile the ECB has now cut before both the Fed and the BOE, which are grappling with more stubborn price pressures and are only expected to follow suit in the coming months, counterparts in other parts of the world have already started easing.\n\nThe Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate on Wednesday and said more moves may come -- becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to do so since the biggest global inflation shock since the 1970s erupted. In Europe, Sweden's Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are among those to have already eased.\n\n-With assistance from Greg Ritchie, William Horobin, Jasmina Kuzmanovic, Alessandra Migliaccio, Irina

The central bank continued to stress that wage growth and services inflation require more attention but achieved the necessary conviction to lower rates given the fact that inflation has fallen 2.5% since September with the outlook improving.\n\nCustomize and filter live economic data via our DailyFX economic calendar\n\nUpdated staff projections revealed upward revisions to both inflation and growth in 2024 which spurred on the euro in the aftermath of the statement. The all-important medium term measure of inflation (2026) remained unchanged at 1.9% but remains under the 2% marker importantly, which is likely to help anchor inflation expectations. 2024 GDP was revised higher, from 0.6% to 0.9% which will serve as some good news for an economy that has stagnated for the last five quarters.\n\nLearn how to prepare for high impact economic data with this easy-to-implement approach:\n\nMarkets reduced their rate cut bets after the upward revisions to the inflation and growth forecasts, helping to lift the euro. EUR/USD traded higher, not seeing much additional uplift from the hotter US initial jobs claims. EUR/CAD continued to rise further, on the back of yesterday's Bank of Canada rate cut. German bund yields firmed slightly but the move remains contained.\n\nThe ECB went to great lengths to communicate a preference for Europe's first rate cut at the June meeting as numerous officials explicitly mentioned that such an outcome would be appropriate.\n\nInflation has, until recently, revealed a steady and consistent decline as restrictive monetary policy has had a desired effect on the level of general prices in the euro zone. However, recent data has propped up, with some corners of the market concerned this may prevent/delay future rate cuts.\n\nBoth hard and soft data (surveys) point towards an improving economic environment in the euro zone. GDP rose in Q1 after five successive quarters of stagnant and sometimes negative GDP growth. Additionally, services PMI figures push further into expansionary territory while the manufacturing sector lags behind but has also seen an improvement. Economic sentiment indicators have been rising since Q3 last year and consumer sentiment has been on the up in 2024.\n\nHowever, inflation concerns have emerged after EU inflation rose from a steady 2.4% to 2.6% in May (the blue line below).

Based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since our meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per cent in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9 per cent in 2024, 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.6 per cent in 2026.\n\nWe are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem's holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\nThe decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.\n\nI will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.\n\nAfter five quarters of stagnation, the euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent over the first quarter of 2024. The services sector is expanding, and manufacturing is showing signs of stabilisation at low levels. We expect the economy to continue to recover as higher wages and improved terms of trade push up real incomes. Stronger exports should also support growth over the coming quarters, as global demand for goods and services rises. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.\n\nEmployment rose by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, with around 500,000 new jobs created, and surveys point to continued job growth in the near term. The unemployment rate edged down to 6.4 per cent in April, its lowest level since the start of the euro. Companies are still posting many job vacancies, though slightly fewer than before.\n\nNational fiscal and structural policies should aim at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term. An effective, speedy and full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme, progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union, and a strengthening of the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions. Implementing the EU's revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.\n\nAnnual inflation rose to 2.6 per cent in May, from 2.4 per cent in April, according to Eurostat's flash estimate. Food price inflation declined to 2.6 per cent. Energy price inflation increased to 0.3 per cent, after recording negative annual rates for a year. Goods price inflation continued to decrease in May, to 0.8 per cent. By contrast, services price inflation rose markedly, to 4.1 per cent from 3.7 per cent in April.\n\nMost measures of underlying inflation declined further in April, the last month for which data are available, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures. However, domestic inflation remains high. Wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge. Owing to the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process and the important role of one-off payments, labour costs will likely fluctuate over the near term, as seen in the pick-up in negotiated wages in the first quarter. At the same time, forward-looking indicators signal that wage growth will moderate over the course of the year. Profits are absorbing part of the pronounced rise in unit labour costs, which reduces its inflationary effects.\n\nInflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, including due to energy-related base effects. It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of our restrictive monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2 per cent.\n\nThe risks to economic growth are balanced in the near term but remain tilted to the downside over the medium term. A weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies would weigh on euro area growth. Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are major sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could also be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. Growth could be higher if inflation comes down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes mean that spending increases by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected.\n\nInflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.\n\nMarket interest rates have risen since our April meeting. Financing costs have plateaued at restrictive levels as our past policy rate increases have worked their way through the financial system. The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages were unchanged in April, at 5.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.\n\nCredit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms grew at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in April, down slightly from the previous month. Loans to households continued to grow at 0.2 per cent on an annual basis. The annual growth in broad money - as measured by M3 - rose to 1.3 per cent in April, from 0.9 per cent in March.\n\nIn line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient. The improving economic outlook has fostered financial stability, but heightened geopolitical risks cloud the horizon. An unexpected tightening of global financing conditions could prompt a repricing of financial and non-financial assets, with negative effects on the wider economy. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. The measures that are currently in place or will soon take effect are helping to keep the financial system resilient.\n\nThe Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.

A cut in September is seen as the most likely outcome but confidence on that has waned.\n\n\"Going forward, for the ECB's credibility they will need to hold a very, very neutral stance,\" Vasileios Gkionakis, senior economist and strategist at Aviva Investors, told Bloomberg Television. \"The bar for gaining more confidence has increased.\"\n\nHe questions whether -- in light of the stubborn price pressures -- the ECB's cut would even have arrived had officials not touted it for months in advance.\n\nThe announcement was \"almost exclusively driven by it being far too embarrassing for the Governing Council to back-pedal\" on their pre-commitment, Gkionakis said. \"It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nThis week's decision begins to roll back the unprecedented barrage of hikes deployed to quell the euro zone's worst-ever spike in prices. The step, which nudges the ECB ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in loosening monetary policy, could also help to reinvigorate the 20-nation economy after two years of stagnation and a mild recession.\n\nBut it comes on the back of data releases -- including May inflation, early-year wage rises and recent private-sector business activity -- that came in higher than anticipated. Labor costs will continue to fluctuate in the near term, according to Lagarde.\n\n\"Inflation in Europe hasn't been on a neat downward trajectory, echoing the same awkward policy and credibility dilemma faced by the Federal Reserve,\" said Julian Howard, lead investment director and head of multi-asset solutions at GAM Investments.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"The ECB tried to communicate its discomfort with elevated cost pressures, even though the Governing Council decided to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points today. President Lagarde hinted at a pause in July and the potential for more action in September, although she refrained from providing any clear indications on the timing for the cut.\"\n\n-- David Powell and Jamie Rush, economists. Click here for full REACT\n\nWhile people familiar with the matter are all but excluding a second cut in July, and some are questioning a September move, Lagarde did little to clarify when interest rates may next be adjusted.\n\n\"Are we today moving into a dialing-back phase? I wouldn't volunteer that,\" she told reporters in Frankfurt. \"There's a strong likelihood but it will be data dependent, and what is very uncertain is the speed at which we travel and the time that it will take.\"\n\nShe also cautioned against paying too much attention to predictions from her Governing Council colleagues. \"We know the path we are on but we also know there will be other bumps on the road,\" she said.\n\nThey include meeting the inflation target later than planned, with the ECB's latest quarterly outlook showing it will moderate to 2% in the third quarter of 2025, rather than in the middle of that year as previously thought.\n\nThe revision adds to the \"sticky inflation story that may limit the room for additional rate cuts,\" said Theophile Legrand, a rates strategist at Natixis SA.\n\nNicolas Forest, chief investment officer at Candriam, goes further.\n\n\"This initial cut may not signal the start of a sustained easing cycle,\" he said. \"On the contrary, the new guidance remains cautious, avoiding any clear direction on future moves.\"\n\n--With assistance from Mark Schroers, Jana Randow, Jasmina Kuzmanovic and Lisa Abramowicz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

There are 180,000 customers with \u00adtracker mortgages, which represent around a quarter of the mortgage market.\n\nEvery cut of 0.25 points will knock \u20ac15 off the monthly repayments on a typical tracker. Most of those on \u00adtrackers still owe around \u20ac100,000 and have around 15 years left to pay.\n\nTracker customers will also see a \u00adfurther one-off fall of 0.35 percentage points in September as the ECB aligns its various rates, which will provide a further reduction in monthly repayments.\n\nThose with trackers have been hit hardest by the 10 hikes in ECB rates that started in the middle of 2022.\n\nThis is because each rise, or fall, in the ECB's refinancing rate is automatically passed on to tracker mortgage holders.\n\nRate-cut expectations have been pared back as inflation is still a problem.\n\nEurozone inflation data came in at a slightly higher rate than forecast last month. Annual inflation ticked up to 2.6pc in May, from 2.4pc in April, stalling moves for more, and faster, ECB rate cuts.\n\nBroker Michael Dowling said mortgage holders coming to the end of fixed rates and thousands of people on variable rates will be depending on their bank in terms of what happens their rate in the wake of the ECB cut. He said the key ECB refinancing rate increased to 4.5pc last September, but banks only increased their fixed rates by between 1.75 percentage points and two points.\n\nMr Dowling said variable rates only increased by one percentage point at the AIB Group, which includes EBS and Haven, while Bank of Ireland reduced its variable rate and PTSB increased its by 0.25 points.\n\n\"Banks will not pass on the full rate reductions as their appetite for market share and, more importantly, profitability determines the pricing of fixed and variable rate mortgages,\" Mr Dowling said.\n\nManaging director of Doddl.ie Martina Hennessy said the fixed-rate decreases we have seen over the last two months have already factored in anticipated ECB rate decreases.\n\n\"It is impossible to predict future rates accurately, but we are unlikely to see rates fall to the low levels experienced pre-2022,\" she said.\n\nThat was a period when rates were below 2pc. However, Ms Hennessy predicted that we are likely to see further decreases on individual rates.\n\nShe said this is particularly the case for non-bank lenders, which are lending at rates of up to 7pc. They should start to reduce rates as funding costs decrease.\n\nThis week, it emerged that Taoiseach Simon Harris is to seek a meeting with the heads of all Irish banks where he plans to insist on rate reductions being passed on \"without delay\".\n\nThe ECB is cutting interest rates as it feels the 10 increases it implemented up to last September has contributed to bringing down the headline inflation rate in the eurozone.

While inflation is within the SNB's target range, SNB chairman Thomas Jordan has warned it may tick higher if the franc weakens and import prices rise.\n\n2/ SWEDEN\n\nSweden's Riksbank lowered borrowing costs to 3.75% from 4% in May and is expected to hold them steady at its June 26 meeting before embarking on small cuts from August.\n\nSwedish inflation has dropped from a peak of more than 10% in 2022 to just above the central bank's 2% target, but the economy has rebounded from a slowdown in 2023 caused by price rises and rate hikes.\n\n3/ CANADA\n\nThe Bank of Canada became the first G7 nation to cut rates on Wednesday, trimming benchmark borrowing costs by 25 bps to 4.75% and promising more easing to come.\n\nThe BoC's first cut in four years was widely expected after inflation hit a three-year low of 2.7% in April. Traders expect two more 25bp cuts this year.\n\n4/ EURO ZONE\n\nThe ECB cut rates for the first time in five years on Thursday, lowering its record-high deposit rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%.\n\nBut the ECB raised its inflation forecasts and stressed that any further rate reduction would depend on incoming data. It reaffirmed that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on prices.\n\nMarkets price in a further 36 bps of rate cuts by year-end.\n\n5/ BRITAIN\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to hold rates at the 16-year high of 5.25% at its June 20 meeting and traders will be straining for any clues about what comes next.\n\nThis is the only event before the July 4 election when BoE policymakers will speak publicly. Traders, uncertain about how the election might sway BoE thinking and unsettled by hot services inflation, have scrapped earlier bets for a first cut in June or August. September is now seen as the most likely start date for easing.\n\n6/ UNITED STATES\n\nThe Fed has kept rates in the 5.25% to 5.5% range since July 2023 and appears unlikely to make changes at its June 12 meeting, while the world's largest economy stays strong and inflation remains above target.\n\nA recent soft core inflation reading could tilt Fed policymakers towards a September cut, but they are expected to stay cautious after that. Traders, who back in January expected 150 bps of Fed cuts this year, now expect about 44 bps worth.\n\n7/ NEW ZEALAND\n\nMoney markets predict the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will keep its cash rate on hold at 5.5% until November.\n\nHigh rates have hobbled New Zealand's economy but the central bank at its May meeting prioritised battling inflation, running at 4%.\n\n8/ AUSTRALIA\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has held rates at a 12-year high of 4.35% since November, and is not expected to lower borrowing costs until well into 2025.\n\nAustralian consumer inflation for April unexpectedly picked up to a five-month high of 3.6%, year-on-year.\n\n9/ NORWAY\n\nNorway's central bank warned in May that rates might stay at 16-year highs of 4.5% for \"longer than previously thought\".\n\nSince then, data has shown that Norway's economy grew in the first quarter of 2024 and that core inflation, at 4.4% year-on-year in April, fell less than expected.\n\nMarkets see Norges Bank holding rates steady at its June 20 meeting, with no cuts until November.\n\n10/ JAPAN\n\nThe Bank of Japan is the outlier, raising rates out of negative territory in March in its first hike in 17 years.\n\nMarkets expect another 25 bps hike this year as policymakers focus on the yen, which hit its weakest level in 34 years in April, prompting government intervention.\n\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda said on Thursday the central bank should reduce its huge bond purchases.

It was reported back in March that the ECB aren't 'sufficiently confident' that they'd reach the goal, they're still looking to implement two more cuts by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, there are still possibilities that the interest rates increase again, and while the cuts are welcome news, mortgage holders are still paying thousands more than before.\n\nWell... it gets a little more complicated.\n\nWhile those who have a pillar mortgage may not see the decreases be passed on to them, that doesn't mean that they may be paying more -- as they mightn't have seen the increases brought in by the ECB in the first place.\n\nPhilip Lane, ECB Chief Economist and former Irish Central Bank governor said back in March that the data would bring down the 'top layer' of restrictions.\n\n'It has been reasonable for us in the last few weeks to basically signal that barring major surprises, many people on the Governing Council, including myself... have indicated there may be enough in the data to say we can remove the top layer of restrictiveness.'\n\nEY Ireland chief economist Dr Loretta O'Sullivan said the outcome of the ECB meeting in March was 'in line with expectations,' adding: 'Timing wise, the summer looks more likely [for an interest rate cut] than April at this point, partly because more wage data will be available by then.'", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_R._Lane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philip R.

Based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since our meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per cent in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9 per cent in 2024, 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.6 per cent in 2026.\n\nWe are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem\u00b4s holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by EUR7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\nThe decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.\n\nI will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.\n\nEconomic activity\n\nAfter five quarters of stagnation, the euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent over the first quarter of 2024. The services sector is expanding, and manufacturing is showing signs of stabilisation at low levels. We expect the economy to continue to recover as higher wages and improved terms of trade push up real incomes. Stronger exports should also support growth over the coming quarters, as global demand for goods and services rises. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.\n\nEmployment rose by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, with around 500,000 new jobs created, and surveys point to continued job growth in the near term. The unemployment rate edged down to 6.4 per cent in April, its lowest level since the start of the euro. Companies are still posting many job vacancies, though slightly fewer than before.\n\nNational fiscal and structural policies should aim at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term. An effective, speedy and full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme, progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union, and a strengthening of the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions. Implementing the EU\u00b4s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.\n\nInflation\n\nAnnual inflation rose to 2.6 per cent in May, from 2.4 per cent in April, according to Eurostat\u00b4s flash estimate. Food price inflation declined to 2.6 per cent. Energy price inflation increased to 0.3 per cent, after recording negative annual rates for a year. Goods price inflation continued to decrease in May, to 0.8 per cent. By contrast, services price inflation rose markedly, to 4.1 per cent from 3.7 per cent in April.\n\nMost measures of underlying inflation declined further in April, the last month for which data are available, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures. However, domestic inflation remains high. Wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge. Owing to the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process and the important role of one-off payments, labour costs will likely fluctuate over the near term, as seen in the pick-up in negotiated wages in the first quarter. At the same time, forward-looking indicators signal that wage growth will moderate over the course of the year. Profits are absorbing part of the pronounced rise in unit labour costs, which reduces its inflationary effects.\n\nInflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, including due to energy-related base effects. It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of our restrictive monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2 per cent.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nThe risks to economic growth are balanced in the near term but remain tilted to the downside over the medium term. A weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies would weigh on euro area growth. Russia\u00b4s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are major sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could also be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. Growth could be higher if inflation comes down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes mean that spending increases by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected.\n\nInflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.\n\nFinancial and monetary conditions\n\nMarket interest rates have risen since our April meeting. Financing costs have plateaued at restrictive levels as our past policy rate increases have worked their way through the financial system. The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages were unchanged in April, at 5.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.\n\nCredit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms grew at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in April, down slightly from the previous month. Loans to households continued to grow at 0.2 per cent on an annual basis. The annual growth in broad money - as measured by M3 - rose to 1.3 per cent in April, from 0.9 per cent in March.\n\nIn line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient. The improving economic outlook has fostered financial stability, but heightened geopolitical risks cloud the horizon. An unexpected tightening of global financing conditions could prompt a repricing of financial and non-financial assets, with negative effects on the wider economy. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. The measures that are currently in place or will soon take effect are helping to keep the financial system resilient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nIn any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.\n\nWe are now ready to take your questions.

They've telegraphed that quite clearly to markets over the last few weeks. So, don't expect any surprises on that front whatsoever. But in terms of market pricing, what are traders seeing for the remainder of the year?\n\nIn total, traders are now pricing in ~64 bps of rate cuts by the ECB for 2024. That includes the one coming later today.\n\nSo, that reads as something along the lines of two to three rate cuts for the year. In other words, another one or two more 25 bps rate cuts after this month.\n\nIs that a plausible expectation though?\n\nGiven the circumstances, the ECB won't pre-commit to further moves. But there is every likelihood that Lagarde may stress that they will go from meeting to meeting by analysing the data. That is to say that every meeting has the potential to be a live one.\n\nLet's be realistic though. A back-to-back move is pretty much a non-starter, at least for the time being. So, one can safely rule out another rate cut in July at least. That unless we see some extraordinary economic developments in the next one month. I wouldn't hold my breath on that though.\n\nSo, when can the ECB next act again?\n\nThat leaves them with just three more meetings for the year. One each in September, October, and December.\n\nShould the disinflation narrative continue in Q3 this year, I reckon that may tee up one more rate cut at least for the ECB. Otherwise, they might have to stay sidelined for quite a while yet.\n\nGiven the timing, markets have many months to consider the next move by the ECB.

While inflation is within the SNB's target range, SNB chairman Thomas Jordan has warned it may tick higher if the franc weakens and import prices rise.\n\n2/ SWEDEN\n\nSweden's Riksbank lowered borrowing costs to 3.75% from 4% in May and is expected to hold them steady at its June 26 meeting before embarking on small cuts from August.\n\nSwedish inflation has dropped from a peak of more than 10% in 2022 to just above the central bank's 2% target, but the economy has rebounded from a slowdown in 2023 caused by price rises and rate hikes.\n\n3/ CANADA\n\nThe Bank of Canada became the first G7 nation to cut rates on Wednesday, trimming benchmark borrowing costs by 25 bps to 4.75% and promising more easing to come.\n\nThe BoC's first cut in four years was widely expected after inflation hit a three-year low of 2.7% in April. Traders expect two more 25bp cuts this year.\n\n4/ EURO ZONE\n\nThe ECB cut rates for the first time in five years on Thursday, lowering its record-high deposit rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%.\n\nBut the ECB raised its inflation forecasts and stressed that any further rate reduction would depend on incoming data. It reaffirmed that borrowing costs needed to remain high enough to keep a lid on prices.\n\nMarkets price in a further 36 bps of rate cuts by year-end.\n\n5/ BRITAIN\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to hold rates at the 16-year high of 5.25% at its June 20 meeting and traders will be straining for any clues about what comes next.\n\nThis is the only event before the July 4 election when BoE policymakers will speak publicly. Traders, uncertain about how the election might sway BoE thinking and unsettled by hot services inflation, have scrapped earlier bets for a first cut in June or August. September is now seen as the most likely start date for easing.\n\n6/ UNITED STATES\n\nThe Fed has kept rates in the 5.25% to 5.5% range since July 2023 and appears unlikely to make changes at its June 12 meeting, while the world's largest economy stays strong and inflation remains above target.\n\nA recent soft core inflation reading could tilt Fed policymakers towards a September cut, but they are expected to stay cautious after that. Traders, who back in January expected 150 bps of Fed cuts this year, now expect about 44 bps worth.\n\n7/ NEW ZEALAND\n\nMoney markets predict the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will keep its cash rate on hold at 5.5% until November.\n\nHigh rates have hobbled New Zealand's economy but the central bank at its May meeting prioritised battling inflation, running at 4%.\n\n8/ AUSTRALIA\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has held rates at a 12-year high of 4.35% since November, and is not expected to lower borrowing costs until well into 2025.\n\nAustralian consumer inflation for April unexpectedly picked up to a five-month high of 3.6%, year-on-year.\n\n9/ NORWAY\n\nNorway's central bank warned in May that rates might stay at 16-year highs of 4.5% for \"longer than previously thought\".\n\nSince then, data has shown that Norway's economy grew in the first quarter of 2024 and that core inflation, at 4.4% year-on-year in April, fell less than expected.\n\nMarkets see Norges Bank holding rates steady at its June 20 meeting, with no cuts until November.\n\n10/ JAPAN\n\nThe Bank of Japan is the outlier, raising rates out of negative territory in March in its first hike in 17 years.\n\nMarkets expect another 25 bps hike this year as policymakers focus on the yen, which hit its weakest level in 34 years in April, prompting government intervention.\n\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda said on Thursday the central bank should reduce its huge bond purchases. Investors are watching to see whether it begins that at its June 13-14 meeting.\n\nReporting by Naomi Rovnick and Alun John; Graphics by Kripa Jayaram, Pasit Kongkunakornkul, Riddhima Talwani, Sumanta

But investors can't relax yet: the key for markets is how many cuts there'll be and when - and that all depends on . Now, energy and food had been driving prices higher, but they've been calming down lately. Problem is, wages have picked up recently - and because that means folk have money to spend, those increases are feeding back into inflation. The ECB doesn't seem overly confident, either, revising its inflation forecasts to land above its 2% target for this year and next. Remember, inflation increasing could lead to rates staying higher for longer. No wonder the central bank wouldn't commit to any particular path, saying decisions will be made meeting-by-meeting based on the latest data.\n\nInterest rate cuts can really bolster an economy: they make borrowing cheaper, encouraging businesses, consumers, and governments to spend more money. It also helps that companies can afford to hire more staff, lining the wallets of workers. All that spending spurs on the economy and companies' - which, in turn, makes more appealing to investors.\n\nThe bigger picture: Domino effect.\n\nThe lower interest rates are, the less folk earn by sticking cash in a savings account. That pushes them toward riskier assets with the possibility of higher returns, like stocks. And right now, it looks like we're heading in that direction: Switzerland and Canada have already cut rates, and the UK and US are expected to follow suit later this year.

The economist expects a total of four 25 basis point rate cuts this year, which would ultimately bring the deposit rate down to 3.00 percent by December.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/forextopstory/2024/june/ecb-apr11_06jun24-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 446, "textEnd": 460}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

That is\n\nIn October 2022, inflation peaked at double digits, but by September 2023, it had reduced to 5.2%, and currently, it stands at 2.6%. President Lagarde emphasized the need for more data to confirm the disinflationary path, noting that while restrictive measures were more pronounced in September, various factors such as base effects and wage trends could introduce uncertainties. Wages, particularly in the services sector, play a significant role in inflation. Although wages remain elevated, there are signs of a recent decline, and the ECB must consider wage divergences across countries and the impact on services prices.\n\nThe ECB's policy decisions and data releases are not perfectly synchronized, making it difficult to predict future actions. Lagarde stated that market pricing of rate cuts is independent of ECB decisions, which have resulted in a reduction of anticipated rate cuts from 64 bps to 36 bps for the remainder of the year, totaling ~61 bps. Despite various challenges, including unanticipated bumps in the disinflationary process, the ECB is committed to bringing inflation back to the 2% target in the medium term. The decision to moderate the restrictive stance was almost unanimous, except for one governor. The ECB will continue to take a serious approach to combating inflation, staying restrictive until the 2% target is achieved. Lagarde affirmed that the ECB is far from reaching the neutral rate, which remains a key objective.\n\nPS It is now being reported by Reuters that ECB Holzmann was the lone dissenter.

Juni 2024.\n\nThe Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since our meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per cent in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9 per cent in 2024, 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.6 per cent in 2026.\n\nWe are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem's holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\nThe decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.\n\nI will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.\n\nEconomic activity\n\nAfter five quarters of stagnation, the euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent over the first quarter of 2024. The services sector is expanding, and manufacturing is showing signs of stabilisation at low levels. We expect the economy to continue to recover as higher wages and improved terms of trade push up real incomes. Stronger exports should also support growth over the coming quarters, as global demand for goods and services rises. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.\n\nEmployment rose by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, with around 500,000 new jobs created, and surveys point to continued job growth in the near term. The unemployment rate edged down to 6.4 per cent in April, its lowest level since the start of the euro. Companies are still posting many job vacancies, though slightly fewer than before.\n\nNational fiscal and structural policies should aim at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term. An effective, speedy and full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme, progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union, and a strengthening of the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions. Implementing the EU's revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.\n\nInflation\n\nAnnual inflation rose to 2.6 per cent in May, from 2.4 per cent in April, according to Eurostat's flash estimate. Food price inflation declined to 2.6 per cent. Energy price inflation increased to 0.3 per cent, after recording negative annual rates for a year. Goods price inflation continued to decrease in May, to 0.8 per cent. By contrast, services price inflation rose markedly, to 4.1 per cent from 3.7 per cent in April.\n\nMost measures of underlying inflation declined further in April, the last month for which data are available, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures. However, domestic inflation remains high. Wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge. Owing to the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process and the important role of one-off payments, labour costs will likely fluctuate over the near term, as seen in the pick-up in negotiated wages in the first quarter. At the same time, forward-looking indicators signal that wage growth will moderate over the course of the year. Profits are absorbing part of the pronounced rise in unit labour costs, which reduces its inflationary effects.\n\nInflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, including due to energy-related base effects. It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of our restrictive monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2 per cent.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nThe risks to economic growth are balanced in the near term but remain tilted to the downside over the medium term. A weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies would weigh on euro area growth. Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are major sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could also be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. Growth could be higher if inflation comes down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes mean that spending increases by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected.\n\nInflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.\n\nFinancial and monetary conditions\n\nMarket interest rates have risen since our April meeting. Financing costs have plateaued at restrictive levels as our past policy rate increases have worked their way through the financial system. The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages were unchanged in April, at 5.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.\n\nCredit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms grew at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in April, down slightly from the previous month. Loans to households continued to grow at 0.2 per cent on an annual basis. The annual growth in broad money - as measured by M3 - rose to 1.3 per cent in April, from 0.9 per cent in March.\n\nIn line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient. The improving economic outlook has fostered financial stability, but heightened geopolitical risks cloud the horizon. An unexpected tightening of global financing conditions could prompt a repricing of financial and non-financial assets, with negative effects on the wider economy. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. The measures that are currently in place or will soon take effect are helping to keep the financial system resilient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.

The quarter-point drop from 4 to 3.75 per cent, which president Christine Lagarde had teed up in recent months, will give European borrowers some relief. The ECB followed through with what it had indicated, which matters for the credibility of the institution. It also made a pragmatic, precautionary move.\n\nCentral banking is about weighing up risks. Since the pandemic, the fear has been that rising inflation would spiral higher if rates were not restrictive enough. Slowly, the dynamics have shifted. Now, with inflation trending down and inching closer to 2 per cent across advanced economies, the impact of the high cost of credit on economic activity is receiving more attention. Keep rates too high, for too long, and inflation may fall too far -- and take growth with it.\n\nIn the Eurozone, inflation has been gliding gently down towards 2 per cent all year, with a slight hiccup last month. Forward-looking indicators appear promising. Surveys of business sales price expectations point to a weakening in core inflation components ahead, as do falling wages advertised on postings tracked by Indeed, a jobs board.\n\nSigns that the disinflation trend will continue, combined with 18 months of weak quarterly economic growth, are a decent enough rationale to remove the top level of rate restriction. Although recent indicators look more optimistic for activity, tight lending conditions and declining hiring plans suggest it remains restrained.\n\nLagarde was still wise to be tight-lipped about the ECB's subsequent moves. The uptick in Eurozone inflation in May combined with continued global economic uncertainty -- including over supply chains and tariff regimes -- underline that there are still upside risks to prices. Accordingly, today's 25 basis point cut, which keeps the ECB's policy relatively restrictive, should be seen as a calibrated step to weaken the vice on the Eurozone economy, and not the beginning of a quick-fire easing cycle.\n\nCentral banks in advanced economies are increasingly aware that waiting until inflation reaches 2 per cent before cutting rates may be too late. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada made its first cut. The US Federal Reserve and Bank of England will need to make their own risk assessments at their meetings in the coming weeks, too.\n\nUntil recently, sturdy economic growth and a stop-start disinflation process had raised prospects that the Fed would delay rate cuts further into the year. But a run of data, including a downbeat manufacturing outlook, more signs of cooling in the jobs market and a resumption of the downward trend in core inflation in April -- albeit still too high above target -- have emboldened doves calling for a precautionary first cut. The latest non-farm payrolls data, which land on Friday, will provide a clearer picture.\n\nIn Britain, inflation took a mighty leap down to just 2.3 per cent in April, yet rates remain at their peak this cycle. Unemployment has been edging up and hiring activity is weakening, although hawks point to some risks of stickiness in prices.\n\nAfter numerous months of overshooting their inflation targets, monetary policy makers are understandably worried that price growth may swing back up again. But they must also be alert to the changing balance of risks, as they trade off inflation and growth. Other central banks might judge that they do not need to copy the ECB's move immediately, but they are unlikely to be far off.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F85cbc26d-7013-4c14-ba88-fda73911a35c.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

As recently as mid-May, three cuts were fully priced through the end of 2024. The ECB said it sees inflation ending this year at 2.5%, compared to 2.3% previously. Its projection for 2025 rose to 2.2% from 2%.\n\nThe common currency climbed as much as 0.3% to $1.0902. The yield on Germany's benchmark 10-year yield rose six basis points to 2.57%, still well below a peak of 2.71% reached just last week.\n\n\"All told, this was a cautious cut,\" said Samuel Zief, head of global FX strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, noting core inflation isn't expected to reach 2% until 2025. \"We see an environment that should boost not only equities but help limit any downside for the currency as well,\" he said, adding he sees fair value for the euro at around $1.10.\n\nThe repricing also comes as policymakers signaled they would be guided by economic data as they decide next steps with regard to easing policy further, a turnaround from the central bank's approach for this meeting where it effectively pre-committed to a cut.\n\nECB Delivers Landmark Rate Cut But Few Signals on Next Steps\n\nTraders have been tempering bets on rate cuts for months, as challenges of bringing inflation back to the 2% target become more apparent. Euro-area consumer price growth accelerated more than anticipated in May, with a measure stripping out volatile components like food and energy quickening to 2.9%.\n\n\"Although today's decision was fully anticipated, the market will be pondering the fact that the ECB is cutting policy rates into a cyclical economic upturn,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.\n\nThe upward revision to inflation forecasts \"emphasize the need for a cautious approach to future policy decisions,\" she said. \"Lagarde will be careful to avoid pre-committing to a future policy path which, in turn, suggests that a July rate cut is very unlikely.\"\n\n--With assistance from Greg Ritchie, Alice Atkins, Naomi Tajitsu, James Hirai and Bastian Benrath.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

President Lagarde emphasized the need for more data to confirm the disinflationary path, noting that while restrictive measures were more pronounced in September, various factors such as base effects and wage trends could introduce uncertainties. Wages, particularly in the services sector, play a significant role in inflation. Although wages remain elevated, there are signs of a recent decline, and the ECB must consider wage divergences across countries and the impact on services prices.\n\nThe ECB's policy decisions and data releases are not perfectly synchronized, making it difficult to predict future actions. Lagarde stated that market pricing of rate cuts is independent of ECB decisions, which have resulted in a reduction of anticipated rate cuts from 64 bps to 36 bps for the remainder of the year, totaling ~61 bps. Despite various challenges, including unanticipated bumps in the disinflationary process, the ECB is committed to bringing inflation back to the 2% target in the medium term. The decision to moderate the restrictive stance was almost unanimous, except for one governor. The ECB will continue to take a serious approach to combating inflation, staying restrictive until the 2% target is achieved. Lagarde affirmed that the ECB is far from reaching the neutral rate, which remains a key objective.\n\nPS It is now being reported by Reuters that ECB Holzmann was the lone dissenter. Holzmann is considered more of a hawk and his dissent solidifies that distinction.\n\nThe EURUSD moved to a high of 1.0901 and in the process above the May 2024 high at 1.08944, but momentum could not be sustained. The subsequent low move down to 1.0864. That took the price below its 100-day moving average of 1.0873, but the price remained above the rising 200 hour moving 1.08569 (green line).

And US Treasuries are back in the red. It does not change our view to take profits before the employment number tomorrow.\"\n\nUS 10-year yields rose two basis points to 4.30%. The S&P 500 fluctuated. European shares held near a record high. The euro rose 0.1% and the yield on 10-year German bonds climbed four basis points to 2.55%.\n\nECB's Holzmann Dissented on Rate-Cut Vote Because of Data\n\nWhile investors are still betting the ECB will lower rates again this year, the timing of that reduction is once again being questioned. Traders went from betting on two additional moves this year to favoring just one. A cut in September is seen as the most likely outcome but confidence on that has waned.\n\nTo Mark Wall at Deutsche Bank AG, the immediate tone of the ECB decision was that of a \"hawkish cut\".\n\n\"This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy,\" he noted.\n\nTraders have escalated rate-cut bets in the past week, emboldened by a slew of softer-than-forecast US economic data, the Bank of Canada's decision to ease monetary policy, and expectations that the ECB would be next to cut.\n\nThe enthusiasm for bonds will once again be tested as US non-farm payrolls data on Friday provide fresh clues on whether growth is cooling sufficiently in the world's largest economy.\n\nA survey conducted by 22V Research shows there's no consensus over the market reaction to employment data -- with 36% of the investors polled betting on a \"risk-off\" reaction, 33% saying \"risk-on\", and 31% \"negligible/mixed.\"\n\nThe tally also highlighted the fact that investors are paying the most attention to Payrolls -- not average hourly earnings, which is a reversal from recent surveys.\n\nOn the eve of the US payrolls report, Wall Street also waded through a slew of data. Jobless claims topped estimates, US labor costs increased by less than previously reported and the trade deficit widened.\n\n-With assistance from Winnie Hsu, John Viljoen, Sujata Rao, Ruth Carson and Masaki Kondo.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Payroll_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Payroll Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wp-content/uploads/swissinfo-theme/swi-fallback-featured-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

But it kept investors in the dark about its next move.\n\n\"Like in the U.S., we have seen significant progress in reducing inflation in Europe.

President Lagarde emphasized the need for more data to confirm the disinflationary path, noting that while restrictive measures were more pronounced in September, various factors such as base effects and wage trends could introduce uncertainties. Wages, particularly in the services sector, play a significant role in inflation. Although wages remain elevated, there are signs of a recent decline, and the ECB must consider wage divergences across countries and the impact on services prices.\n\nThe ECB's policy decisions and data releases are not perfectly synchronized, making it difficult to predict future actions. Lagarde stated that market pricing of rate cuts is independent of ECB decisions, which have resulted in a reduction of anticipated rate cuts from 64 bps to 36 bps for the remainder of the year, totaling ~61 bps. Despite various challenges, including unanticipated bumps in the disinflationary process, the ECB is committed to bringing inflation back to the 2% target in the medium term. The decision to moderate the restrictive stance was almost unanimous, except for one governor. The ECB will continue to take a serious approach to combating inflation, staying restrictive until the 2% target is achieved. Lagarde affirmed that the ECB is far from reaching the neutral rate, which remains a key objective.", "source": {"uri": "forexlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ForexLive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_low@forexlive.com", "name": "Justin Low", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.forexlive.com/images/ECB%20Lagarde%20062024_id_6a1fc02b-c071-406a-8b3d-71d4d829df3a_size975.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Traders keenly await President Christine Lagarde's next move as inflation remains stubborn. Future policy decisions will be influenced by upcoming economic data, particularly the U.S. non-farm payrolls.\n\nA look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee After the Bank of Canada became the first G7 country to cut interest rates, the stage is set for the European Central Bank to lower rates too. But all eyes are sure to be on President Christine Lagarde as traders ponder: what comes next?\n\nWhile ECB policymakers clearly telegraphed their intention to lower borrowing costs in June, moving well ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the path beyond has become uncertain. Recent economic data has underscored that inflation could prove perhaps to be stickier than expected in the euro area, as has been the case in the United States.\n\nThat has brought the focus squarely on what Lagarde will say once the ECB delivers the widely expected rate cut on Thursday. Markets are pricing in 64 basis points of cuts this year. Ahead of the policy decision, the euro was 0.23% firmer at $1.08935, just shy of the two-and-half month peak touched earlier this week.\n\nFutures indicate European bourses are set for a higher open, taking their cue from U.S. and Asian stocks as a slew of U.S. labour data firms bets of a September rate cut from the Fed. Traders are pricing in a 69% chance of a cut in September versus around 50% chance last week.\n\nNon-farm payrolls are due on Friday and will be crucial in dampening or emboldening these renewed policy easing expectations ahead of next week's Fed meeting where the dot plot and comments from officials will take the spotlight.

The underlying economy has been performing and the population has been increasing, which has meant demand for housing has remained strong, Mr Barry said.\n\nDemand has also been boosted by the easing of the Central Bank mortgage lending rules that has led to increased demand in some parts of the market, he said.\n\nMr Barry said although interest rate changes were only one element in determining demand, the shock to borrowers from hefty ECB rate increases had passed, and with rate cuts likely looming a major risk for borrowers had \"been taken out of the equation\".\n\nEconomist Austin Hughes said since late last year borrowers have become more comfortable with the prospects that interest rates would not rise much further and would come down. With limited housing supply, \"you are in circumstances where I think the aspect of cheaper money is already feeding through to dearer house prices\", Mr Hughes said.\n\n\"I think you will see a further acceleration,\" but the rate of house price inflation would be held back nonetheless by the issue of affordability, he said, adding in an election year the risks had increased that politicians would \"outbid each other to offer more incentives to buyers that will lead to higher demand and higher prices\".\n\nEconomist Jim Power said the Irish house price inflation had held up despite a record rise in interest rates, and political pledges in an election year add to the mix of risks.\n\n\"You have to think that house price inflation is going to accelerate given the housing shortages,\" Mr Power said. The Central Bank would push back against any political pressure to ease its mortgage lending rules further, he added.\n\nBank of Ireland group chief economist Conall Mac Coille said most commentators had forecast house price inflation would slow to 3.5% to 4% by the end of the year, but its latest analysis showed people were still bidding up prices above the asking prices.\n\n\"That suggests, given the intensity of competition in the market, that prices could rise more aggressively than 3.5% to 4% this year\", and with the risk of house price inflation through 2024, \"driven in a positive way by pay rises but in a negative way by housing supply that is out there\", Mr Mac Coille said.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eamon_quinn@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Eamon Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Ireland", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Ireland"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Restoration", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Restoration", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8295/4147946_3_articlelarge_MONEY_20Housebuilding_20_2006501917.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

It is widely expected to lower borrowing costs across the eurozone for the first time in five years, down from 4% to 3.75%.\n\nIt comes as inflation across the eurozone cooled this year to 2.6% in the year to May. The bank may also start to unwind a tightening cycle that began in summer 2022, which has pushed the ECB's deposit rate to a record high.\n\nMoney markets are betting that a rate cut comes as a 92% probability, with just an 8% chance of no change. The decision comes at 1.15pm UK time.\n\nHenk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said: \"After nine months of keeping rates on hold, we expect the European Central Bank to embark on a rate-cutting cycle at its meeting on Thursday, 6 June. A quarter-point reduction across its policy rates, the first cut since 2019, is anticipated.\n\n\"Our view is that the governing council's rationale will likely be driven by a stronger-than-expected recovery in activity and increased confidence that inflation will return to the targeted level. Beyond the June meeting, we forecast that we could see quarter-point cuts in September and December.

While the markets want further insight, the ECB reiterated that its next moves will be data-dependent, which he explains \"overtakes the ability for them to provide any credible forward guidance.\" Because of that, McCormick says that we're in a guessing game ahead of the ECB's next meeting in July.\n\nHe adds, \"The challenging part about the currency markets is it's always kind of multi-dimensional,\" as it constantly has to adapt to an evolving market. McCormick explains that with the US economy slowing while Europe recovers, \"the market can't really make its mind up whether or not it wants to sell the dollar on the converging growth story, or whether or not it wants to buy the dollar on the diverging inflation story.\" He says that while many of the G10 central banks have cut rates, the Fed still has not made a move, which could \"challenge this Goldilocks environment we're in where FX volatility is very low.\"\n\nAll right, let's take a look at how the currency markets are reacting to the ECB decision.\n\nAgain, you're

seeing today, you see those trends sticking.\n\nYeah, I think a key piece here is that, you know, kind of markets were looking for the ECP to cut rates that was, you know, fully priced in.\n\nI think a big piece is kind of like what they do next.\n\nYou know, a lot of people have been looking for central banks to deliver some form of forward guidance kind of give them some expectations of where they think things go in the future.\n\nBut in the environment that we're in central banks are what you would call data dependent.\n\nSo essentially data dependency kind of overtakes the ability for them to provide any credible forward guidance.\n\nSo I think part of the reaction here is the ECB can't really pre commit to July, which is the next meeting.\n\nUh So markets were kind of hoping maybe they could give a little nudge that they can move again in July.\n\nBut now the next meeting that's kind of live in September.\n\nUm So there's a lot of guessing now, will inflation come in?\n\nUm As expected, will it continue to fall, will it come in higher?\n\nSo now we're back to the guessing game and uh you know, I guess you could say the markets will qualify this as a bit of a hawkish cut uh without the commitment of moving in July.\n\nWell, it's interesting because Mark, we were just speaking with another guest about how in the States the hire for longer environment has a very different impact than it might globally.\n\nBut we are still seeing this kind of historic divergence in the G 10 central banks.\n\nIs that kind of something that we should be considering as a potential shock or given what I just said about how higher for longer has a different meaning in the US.\n\nDoes that make sense to you that we're seeing this divergence.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nI think there's uh the challenging part about the currency market is it's always kind of multidimensional.\n\nIt's like it's, it's very well known for kind of markets, kind of looking at one thing and then being having to change their vision and correlations constantly flip in the FX market, which makes it very challenging to stick with an idea for too long um as the market evolves.\n\nSo I think a big piece that you need to think about here is, is really the relationships between economic growth and inflation.\n\nUm And one of the things is, is the FX markets kind of only been focused on one or the other for a little period of time.\n\nAnd one of the things that strikes at the heart of G 10 central bank divergence is inflation.\n\nAnd so the underlying indicators that we track things that we run in our models, things that we run in portfolios to track currencies.\n\nWe look at inflation strength, the strength of inflation data in the US is just much stronger than anyone else in the G 10.\n\nUm The interesting part is that the growth story is now converging where the US is slowing Europe is recovering.\n\nOther parts of the world are recovering and the market can't really make its mind up whether or not it wants to sell the dollar on the converging growth story or whether or not it wants to buy the dollar on the diverging inflation story.\n\nOur view here is if you kind of take this uh the mindset that we have, there's just very little room for error for the fed, the markets are only 5050 for September.\n\nAnd if we get one bad, which is high inflation su surprise in the US that can challenge the disinflation narrative.\n\nAnd that, that is what would exacerbate these uh the G 10 central bank divergence, which is we already saw from the Bank of Canada yesterday.\n\nThey cut, they look like they can move uh in July again.\n\nECB hasn't pre committed, but they could basically cut in September.\n\nSo we could basically get to the fall.\n\nAnd we've seen many G 10 Central bank cut SNB Ricks Bank, Bank of Canada, ECB, even the Bank of England.\n\nAnd we have not seen a move from the FED.\n\nAnd this is a very live possibility, which is something that would challenge this goldilocks environment where the, where we're in, where FX volatility is very low.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem's holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\nThe Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be decreased to 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75% respectively, with effect from 12 June 2024.\n\nThe APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.\n\nThe Governing Council will continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until the end of June 2024. Over the second half of the year, it will reduce the PEPP portfolio by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average. The Governing Council intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024.\n\nThe Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.\n\nAs banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.\n\n***\n\nThe Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.\n\nThe President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today.", "source": {"uri": "ecb.europa.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "European Central Bank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wage growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Science_and_Technology_Policy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Science and Technology Policy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?0ef1632c35edede913681bb76af694a4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

EUR - Publication of the ECB's decision on the key interest rate\n\n15:30 GMT+3. USD - Number of initial applications for unemployment benefits\n\n15:45 GMT+3. EUR - ECB Press Conference\n\nEURUSD:\n\nThe EUR and USD pair is strengthening around 1.0890 despite the US Dollar (USD) rebounding during the early Asian session on Thursday. The European Central Bank's (ECB) interest rate decision and President Christine Lagarde's press conference will take center stage in today's euro economic developments.\n\nThe ECB is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at its June 6 meeting, reducing the main refinancing rate, margin lending rate and deposit rate to 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75%, respectively. Financial markets had anticipated that the ECB would cut the rate by 43 bps by September and by around 60 bps by the end of the year. The divergence between the ECB and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) could put pressure on the Euro (EUR) and create a headwind for EUR/USD.\n\nAcross the ocean, speculation is mounting for the Fed's first rate cut in September as the US economy slowed in the first quarter. According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders now estimate the probability of a Fed rate cut in September at nearly 70%, up from 54.9% earlier in the week. The expectation of a Fed rate cut is likely to weigh on the US dollar in the near term.\n\nHowever, the release of stronger-than-expected ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for May provided some support for the dollar. The index rose to 53.8 in May from the previous reading of 49.4, beating the market consensus forecast of 50.8. On Friday, investors will turn their attention to the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data, which is estimated to add 185,000 jobs to the US economy in May.

Shein has denied these claims.\n\n\"It's a tricky one,\" one UK fund manager told the paper. \"I don't think anyone with an ESG team will be able to buy it. It smacks of desperation for the London Stock Exchange -- they'll take anything.\" He added that there is a risk of \"collateral brand damage\" for the LSE.\n\nThe LSE declined to comment. A Shein spokesperson stated the company has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and is committed to respecting human rights.\n\n11.10am: Super-rich pack up to avoid election tax hikes\n\nBloomberg is reporting that wealthy UK residents, including foreign billionaires and City bankers, are \"rushing to shelter their money\" following Rishi Sunak's snap election call.\n\nSome are cashing in investments, paying off bills that may soon rise or leaving the UK entirely, the report suggests, having interviewed over 20 high-net-worth individuals and wealth advisers.\n\n10.55am: UK publishers' Google trial to proceed\n\nAn interesting story I missed yesterday, a potential \u00a313 billion-plus claim by UK publishers against Google over its \"anti-competitive\" advertising technology has been permitted to move to trial.\n\nThe claim alleges that Google abused its dominant position in the adtech market, causing billion of pounds of losses for UK publishers.\n\nLondon's Competition Appeal Tribunal yesterday certified the claim to allow it to go to trial, dismissing Google's arguments - thats via the Press Gazzette.\n\n10.49am: ECB preview\n\nThe European Central Bank decision is due just after 1pm today.\n\nHere are the thoughts of a couple of economists.\n\n\"In recent months we suspected the major central banks were looking for a narrow path for delivering interest rate cuts despite global inflation still running at 3.0% a year,\" says Simon French at Panmure Gordon, noting that this path was needed to provide some economic stimulus while still remaining moderately restrictive in terms of policy and not weakening currencies too much against the US dollar.\n\nYesterday the Bank of Canada followed recent moves by the Swiss National Bank and Sweden's Riksbank in making the first interest rate cuts since the pandemic.\n\n\"Ahead of the June policy meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council - widely expected to deliver the first Eurozone rate cut in this cycle - and the June Bank of England meeting that is expected to use core inflation and the UK General Election as reasons for waiting until August, the BoC has provided the policy and rhetorical template.\n\n\"Moving as a herd is an attractive feature for central bankers privately worried about being labelled the Jean-Claude Trichet of this economic cycle.\n\n\"The BoC has just made that task easier for its European counterparts,\" says French.\n\nFrancesco Pesole at ING says the ECB has \"virtually pre-announced\" a 25 basis point rate cut at today's meeting.\n\nWhile holding rates \"could make sense\" given the latest wages and inflation data, \"the reputational risk is too high\" and in the event of a surprise hold \"the euro could face a brief earthquake\".\n\nWith a cut almost guaranteed and fully priced in by markets, the attention will be on communication, says Pesole.\n\n\"We think it is likely there will be almost no new forward guidance, with the ECB potentially signalling any further easing would only be gradual (in line with off-meeting comments) and that there are still risks to inflation.\n\n\"Inflation forecasts will be watched closely, although the ECB should backpedal towards short-term data dependency, so building policy expectations on new projections would be quite speculative, if not misleading.\"\n\nWhile there are risks for the euro, he doubts this will be a huge event for FX.\n\n\"Unless President Lagarde revamps some of her eloquence (she has seemingly made press conferences intentionally uneventful), then the FX market may be left with more questions than answers.\"\n\nThere's also a meeting later in the day at Denmark's central bank, whose mandate is to keep stability in the EUR/DKK exchange rate, so it will likely cut rates by the same 25 bps a few hours after the ECB.\n\n10.35am: Sunak claim investigated\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has launched an investigation into a statement by Rishi Sunak that the economy is \"going gangbusters\" and that parties could misuse economic data in election campaigning.\n\nRobert Chote, chair of the statistics watchdog, said the body will scrutinise whether the prime minister's comments exaggerated the Tory's economic performance.\n\nSunak used the \"going gangbusters\" phrase after it had been used by an ONS official in a media briefing, making the Daily Mail front page.\n\nUK GDP growth was 0.6% in the first three months of the year, following a shallow recession in the second half of last year, with a decline of 0.3% in the fourth quarter after a 0.1% fall in the third.\n\n10.22am: EU retail sales\n\nEurope retail sales were down 0.5% month-on-month in April, worse than the 0.2% expected decline and after an increase of 0.7% the month before.\n\nCompared to the previous year, sales were flat, which again was lower than an expected 0.1% rise, easing from the previous month's 0.7% growth.\n\n10.05am: UK shares tick higher\n\nMomentum is positive in the FTSE 100 index, with all but three of the top 20 largest stocks in green this morning.\n\nBut with ex-divs holding the index back a little, the gain is small, up 0.2% so far, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.4%.\n\nA Nvidia-led storming run for the Nasdaq last night and the prospect of interest rate cuts in Europe today \"have all combined to put investors in a good mood,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, saying we're now \"beginning the next phase in the cycle\".\n\n\"The ECB is expected to follow the likes of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland by cutting rates later today, bringing the long-awaited pivot in monetary policy and signalling the start of a new era.\n\n\"After a long period of rock-bottom rates, the subsequent period shocked markets to the core as interest rates soared amid high levels of inflation.\n\n\"We're now beginning the next phase in the cycle where inflationary pressures ease and central banks move to a new playbook to help prop up a flagging economy and make life easier for consumers and businesses who have had to stomach sky-high borrowing costs.\"\n\nThe Bank of England and Federal Reserve meetings come next week, and while they might have given the impression they aren't swayed by what the ECB and other countries do, \"the greater the number of central banks cutting, the more pressure they will be under to do the same\", says Mould.\n\nOn the FTSE's top riser, Antofagasta and its deal to improve the water supply at a copper project in Chile, Mould says: \"Mining is a risky industry and anything a company can do to lower the risks is a positive for investors. Ensuring a smooth supply of water is important, particularly when a mine is in a remote or difficult to access location.\"\n\n9.41am: Construction survey beats consensus\n\nA couple of bits of macro data have just come out.\n\nThe UK construction PMI for May came in stronger than forecast at 54.7, up from 53.0 a month earlier and beating the 52.5 consensus estimate.\n\nThe Bank of England's monthly decision maker panel (DMP) survey for May finds UK businesses see year-ahead CPI at 2.9%, flat from the last count.\n\nThey also see output price inflation easing to 3.9% from 4.0% while businesses see year-ahead output wage growth easing to 4.5% from 4.8%.\n\nThe DMP survey gathers views from chief financial officers from large, medium and small businesses, which the BoE says it uses to monitor developments in the economy and to track businesses' views.\n\n9.09am: Big UK automotive order for US autonomous vehicles\n\nShares in Strip Tinning (AIM:STG), a maker of automotive components, had revved up more than 60% earlier after a large German auto group selected it for a \"major high volume strategic nomination\" for autonomous vehicles being developed by a huge US company.\n\nIt described the client as a \"leading German automotive motion technology Tier 1 manufacturer\", while the contract nomination is for the supply of cell contact systems for the battery pack modules.\n\nThe vehicle manufacturer is said by the AIM-listed company to be \"owned by one of the world's largest corporations and is currently running trials on public roads in three US cities\".\n\nThis seems to point to Waymo, owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google's parent company.\n\n8.52am: N Brown back in the black\n\nIt's a pretty quiet day in terms of blue-chip corporate results, but there's some mid-cap numbers out, including from Jacamo and SimplyBe owner N Brown Group PLC (AIM:BWNG), where the shares are up 20%.\n\nThe finals results from the struggling home shopping group N Brown are \"nothing to shout about\", says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, with total revenue down 10%.\n\nBut adjusted EBITDA, while nearly 13% down, are above market expectations and that the company has returned to statutory profits.\n\nCEO Steve Johnson trumpets that \"we have delivered against our strategic and financial objectives this year\", while also saying that in current trading, the rate product revenue decline \"has moderated\", with Q1 declining by 6% and \"this improvement is expected to continue as the year progresses\".\n\n8.44am: European markets up ahead of ECB decision\n\nAhead of the ECB meeting later, the FTSE's small gain is being eclipsed by those on the European mainland, with the ex-dividend stocks weighing on the UK market.\n\nThe FTSE 250 is up 66 points at 20,730.\n\nIn Europe, the DAX is leading with a 0.81% rise, France's CAC 40 up 0.40%, Spain's Ibex 0.37% and Italy's FTSE MIB ahead 0.24%. The wider Stoxx 600 has risen 0.58%.\n\n8.33am: Can anything stop Nvidia?\n\nA stunning fact is that, in just two years, Nvidia's market cap has increased more than 600%, with the chipmaker's valuation rocket past Netflix, past Tesla, past Google, Broadcom, Amazon and Meta, to also overtake Apple in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs of this moment, Nvidia is valued at $3.01 trillion versus Apple's measly $3 trillion.\n\nThe gap is expected to widen even further when US markets open today, with pre-market trades pointing to a 0.95% gain on Nvidia stock and a 0.17% loss on Apple stock, writes my colleague Billy Farrington as he takes a look at the meteoric rise of the semiconductor innovator.\n\n8.27am: Modestly positive market sentiment\n\nPositive stock market sentiment has been rekindled after an erratic May, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nInvestors will remain on \"high alert\" for further economic developments unfolding, he adds.\n\nIn the year to date, the FTSE 100 is up 6.7%, Nasdaq is ahead by 14.5% and the S&P 500 by 12.2%, Germany's Dax has risen around 11.6% and Japan's Nikkei jumped 16.3%.\n\nFocusing on this morning, Hunter says: \"The London market edged higher at the open, with tentative buying interest in the mining sector offsetting some of the more recent weakness across oil and commodity prices in general.\n\n\"Such weakness has tempered gains in the FTSE 100 after a record-breaking level was reached in May ... and despite the uncertainty of an imminent general election, the more domestically focused FTSE 250 has reversed early year losses to stand up by 5.3% in the year to date, latterly propelled by a UK economy which is seeing some benefit from easing inflation and the possibility of lower interest rates, in addition to recently having left a short and shallow technical recession.\"\n\nHe says the appetite for tech stocks is also driving many global indices higher.\n\n\"The likelihood of an interest rate cut later today from the ECB also boosted sentiment, potentially signalling a new era of easier monetary conditions across the globe,\" Hunter adds.\n\n8.16am: FTSE reshuffle confirmed\n\nIn the UK, the FTSE index reshuffle was confirmed last night, involving three demotions from the blue-chip index, with LondonMetric Property, Vistry Group and Darktrace (temporarily as it is being taken over) replacing Ocado, RS Group and St James's Place.\n\nDropping out of the FTSE 250 into the small caps will be Ferrexpo, Mobico Group (National Express) and Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust, replaced by Alpha Group International, Renewi and XPS Pensions Group.\n\n8.08am: FTSE starts higher, ex-divs weigh\n\nThe FTSE 100 is ambling higher, as predicted, rising 12 points or 0.15% to 8259 in the first few minutes of trading.\n\nTop risers initially are copper miner Antofagasta, up 2.5% after a deal to improve the water supply at a copper project in Chile, and precious metals miner Fresnillo, though it's not immediately clear why.\n\nBurberry and Rolls-Royce are next.\n\nVodafone is the big faller, down 5.8% after going ex-dividend.\n\nOther ex-div fallers include WPP, Informa, Sainsbury and National Grid.\n\n7.56am: More weak data from Germany\n\nAfter recent data showed German inflation and unemployment claims increasing, this morning we hear that factory orders in Germany fell by 0.2% month-to-month in April, below the consensus for a 0.6% increase after a revised 0.8% decline in March.\n\nThe year-over-year rate improved to -1.6%. Net revisions to the month-to-month data were down 0.4%.\n\n\"This was a good deal weaker than we expected,\" says economist Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics, but the headline number was held back by a big fall in major orders that masks a 2.9% jump in core orders, which is more in line with forecasts.\n\n7.49am: Regulator calls for scrutiny of AI sector\n\nIn a big tech story after the barnstorming Nvidia performance last night, there are reports that a major US investigation is brewing into the three major players in AI.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal that allows them to proceed with antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia are playing in the industry.\n\nThe two regulators have reached a deal to split responsibility for investigating the three major players in AI.\n\nUS antitrust watchdog also says \"urgent scrutiny\" is needed over big tech's control of AI, according to a Financial Times story, where Department of Justice chief Jonathan Kanter says he is examining \"monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape\" in AI, covering aspects from computing power and data utilised for training large language models to cloud service providers, engineering talent, and essential hardware like graphics processing unit chips.\n\nRegulators must act \"with urgency\" to prevent dominant tech companies from monopolising the market, he says, though he suggests a \"real time\" intervention can be \"less invasive\" for industries.\n\n7.31am: Fever-Tree mixes top line gains with market growth\n\nFevertree Drinks (AIM:FEVR) said it remained \"comfortable with full year expectations\", reporting market share gains and topline growth.\n\nAhead of its AGM, the company issued a statement to say that it anticipates a strong summer trading period with new marketing initiatives.\n\nIn the UK, Fever-Tree has solidified its leading position, especially in the rum, vodka and cocktail mixer categories, while in the US it boasted that its products continue to be \"the biggest contributor to growth within the carbonated mixer category\", while also growing ahead of the market in Europe.\n\n7.14am: Positive start expected for FTSE 100\n\nThe FTSE 100 is expected to hit the ground jogging on Thursday, after a strong finish on Wall Street overnight and ahead of the European Central Bank meeting later today.\n\nSpread-betters have tipped the London benchmark to add 15 points this morning, adding to the 15 it made yesterday to finish at 8,246.95.\n\nLast night Nvidia rocketed 5% to a new record higher, leading a tech melt-up, as the Nasdaq Composite index surged 1.95% and the S&P 500 jumped 1.18%, with the Dow Jones rising a more humdrum 0.25%.\n\nNvidia's continued ascent, up 154% this year, meant it topped a $3 trillion market cap and overtook Apple to become the second largest company in the world by market valuation.\n\nDriving the mood yesterday were various factors, including weak ADP data and Canada's central bank cutting rates.\n\nLower yields boosted appetite in global indices, said market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank. \"The Canadian TSX rebounded past its 50-DMA, the European SXXP jumped while the S&P 500 was catapulted to a fresh record for the 25th time this year.\n\n\"Yes the S&P 500 renewed record 25 times since this year started - regardless of the fact that we spent most of the year scaling back the Fed cut bets and are still not sure if the Fed will be able to cut rates this year at all.\"\n\nYesterday Goldman Sachs predicted a \"wall of money\" from passive equity allocations will pour into the stock market in early July, setting up a rally through the early summer.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_haill@proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "name":

Juni 2024.\n\nThe Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem's holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\nKey ECB interest rates\n\nThe Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be decreased to 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75% respectively, with effect from 12 June 2024.\n\nAsset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)\n\nThe APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.\n\nThe Governing Council will continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until the end of June 2024. Over the second half of the year, it will reduce the PEPP portfolio by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average. The Governing Council intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024.\n\nThe Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.\n\nRefinancing operations\n\nAs banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.\n\n***\n\nThe Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.\n\nThe President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today.", "source": {"uri": "finanzen.at", "dataType": "news", "title": "finanzen.at"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dow_jones@finanzen.at", "name": "Dow Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wage growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anschluss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Science_and_Technology_Policy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Science and Technology Policy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

The cross holds onto strength ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy announcement at 12:15 GMT.\n\nThe ECB IS expected to cut its Deposit Facility Rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%. A rate-cut move by the ECB in June's meeting appears to be a done deal, as several ECB officials have already communicated. However, the attention of investors will be on the interest-rate outlook. The ECB is expected to state that they intend to remain data-dependent and prefer not to commit to any specific interest-rate path as the battle against inflation has not been won yet.\n\nThe reasoning behind abstaining from committing subsequent rate cuts is the higher-than-expected increase in the annual Eurozone's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for May and the return of the old continent to growth after a shallow recession in the second half of 2023.\n\nA slew of ECB policymakers have also warned that premature rate cuts could revamp price pressures again and will offset efforts yet made to bring inflation down to their current levels.\n\nOn the economic front, German Factory Orders for April unexpectedly contracted by 0.2%. The economic data declined for the fourth straight time. Investors anticipated them to have grown by 0.3%. Annually, Industrial Orders contracted by 1.6%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese Yen weakened after Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda commented that inflation expectations are gradually rising but have yet to reach 2%, Reuters reported. Ueda emphasized on reducing bond purchases in a manner to move forward towards their agenda of exiting expansionary policy stance.\n\nOver the policy outlook, BoJ board member Toyoaki Nakamura advised that the current policy framework is appropriate for now as households' purchasing power is weak.

Juni 2024.\n\nThe Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem's holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\nKey ECB interest rates\n\nThe Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be decreased to 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75% respectively, with effect from 12 June 2024.\n\nAsset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)\n\nThe APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.\n\nThe Governing Council will continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until the end of June 2024. Over the second half of the year, it will reduce the PEPP portfolio by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average. The Governing Council intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024.\n\nThe Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.\n\nRefinancing operations\n\nAs banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.\n\n***\n\nThe Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.\n\nThe President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today.", "source": {"uri": "finanzen.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "finanzen.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dow_jones@finanzen.ch", "name": "Dow Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anschluss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wage growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Science_and_Technology_Policy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Science and Technology Policy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627131", "eventUri": "eng-9627131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

but this \"still leaves room for a few more cuts\", says economist Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThat the ECB statement repeats the line from the March statement about the \"appropriateness\" of easing policy if inflation forecasts continue to signal 2% in the medium term \"is a dovish surprise to us\", Vistesen says, but assistance that future decisions \"will ensure that its policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\", still signals the clear bias, he adds.\n\nUpgraded inflation forecasts, where the near-term profile has been revised to well above 2% next year, \"is consistent with our view that the policy rate won't fall below 3% next year, though that still leaves room for a few more cuts\", Vistesen says.\n\n\"We still see the ECB cutting in September and December, and we're leaning towards a third rate cut in March if our Q1 forecasts hold over the summer.\"\n\nThe press conference is underway and there will be more reactions during and after that.\n\n2.03pm: ECB path to future cuts now looks 'slower than anticipated'\n\n\"Any celebrations about today's 25bp rate cut by the ECB are likely to be muted at best,\" says economist Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics, \"given that the decision was fully discounted by financial markets and the most recent inflation and wage data have dampened expectations for a rapid easing cycle.\"\n\nHe says, the bank's forecasts and statements are \"slightly hawkish\", ie do not imply lots more rate cuts.\n\nThe market focus is on the ECB's revised economic forecasts and policy guidance, with headline and core inflation expected to average 2.2% next year rather than 2.0% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n\"This implies that the future path of rate cuts may be a little slower than previously anticipated,\" says Kenningham.\n\n\"At the press conference, President Lagarde will give little away and will not pre-commit to any further rate cuts. However, she may offer some clues about how concerned policymakers are by the stickiness of wage and services inflation.\"\n\n1.58am: SpaceX Starship launch successful... so far\n\nThe super-massive SpaceX giant Starship has successfully launched on its fourth test flight, with its Super Heavy booster having achieved a 'soft splashdown' as planned.\n\nThe Starship spaceship has entered space, as its predecessor did in the third flight though it was unable to be returned to Earth.\n\n1.40pm: ECB forecasts hit bonds\n\nEuropean bond movements suggest the ECB move, or maybe just the inflation forecasts, were not fully priced in by markets.\n\nBond yields have risen and UK, German and French stock indices are heading lower.\n\nMeanwhile, US weekly jobless claims are in.\n\nThe initial reading for the week ending last Saturday that claims rose to a four-week high of 229k, above the 220k expected and the prior week's 219k.\n\nContinued jobless claims were also up, to 1.792 million from 1.791 million, beating the 1.790 million expected.\n\n1.29pm: Inflation is down but not out, forecasts hiked\n\nThe ECB governing council said it decided to lower the three key interest rates as the time was right, due to the fall in inflation by more than 2.5 percentage points since its September meeting.\n\n\"Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.\"\n\nThe inflation outlook has also \"improved markedly\", the council felt, with underlying inflation having also eased, \"reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons\".\n\nMonetary policy has dampened demand and kept inflation expectations \"well anchored,\" the council said, helping bringing inflation back down, though domestic price pressures remain strong from elevated wage growth.\n\nThe next move from the ECB was not clear, as the governing council expects inflation to stay above target \"well into next year\", with latest staff projections for revised up for 2024 and 2025.\n\nHeadline CPI inflation is now forecast to average 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, with core inflation, which excludes energy and food, seen at 2.8% in 2024, falling to 2.2% in 2025.\n\nEconomic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024 and 1.4% in 2025.\n\n1.16pm: The ECB cuts\n\nThe ECB cuts rates as expected.\n\nIt repeats an intention to keep rates restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve its aims and repeats its data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach.\n\n1.04pm: Royal Mail short bet\n\nJust a few minutes until the ECB decision is confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, we've reports that Royal Mail's parent company, International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS), is being shorted by a New York hedge fund.\n\nThis could be a bet on the collapse of the postal service group's \u00a33.6 billion takeover from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\n\nSessa Capital initially reported it had opened a 0.73% net short position with IDS last Friday, just days after the board recommended the offer.\n\nEarlier this week, the investment group upped its position to 0.83%, with analysts labelling the move \"bold\" but \"intriguing\".\n\n12.59pm: More election tax sparring\n\nTory MP Laura Trott has accused Labour of \"asking for a blank cheque\" to raise taxes across the board this election.\n\nNot so, shadow defence secretary John Healey told Sky News this morning. \"The taxes that are most important to people - income tax, VAT and National Insurance - will not be raised under a Labour government.\"\n\nBut there is one field where promises are no so crystal clear: capital gains tax (CGT).\n\nAccording to courses cited by The Guardian, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is under pressure from colleagues to commit to CGT increases, should she be the one to deliver the autumn budget...read more here.\n\n12.47pm: Starship rocket's fourth flight test this afternoon\n\nStarship, the giant rocket made by Elon Musk's SpaceX, is scheduled to blast off on its fourth flight test later today.\n\nWith the launch taking place at the company's Boca Raton base on the Texas coast, the target time is 7.50am Central Time, which is 1.50pm London time.\n\nIt follows significant progress made on the previous test for the 120-metre tall rocket, which reached space but it did not successfully make it back to Earth in one piece.\n\n12.31pm: Swifties' economic sparks fly\n\nBig news for financial publications, which don't get to write about pop stars much: Taylor Swift this week is kicking off the UK leg of her Eras tour, with a string of concerts which are expected to generate \u00a31 billion for the British economy.\n\nFresh from her The Tortured Poets Department album release, Swift will get her tour of Britain underway at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with her frankly crazy levels of popularity expected to lead to road closures, record attendances and a horde of frenzied merchandise and other spending.\n\nSome 220,000 fans are forecast to attend the three Edinburgh performances, with the local council warning that roads and areas near the arena would be disrupted - read more here if you like.\n\n12.12pm: Markets tiptoeing higher\n\nTrading in London shares remains positive at just after midday, tiptoeing higher ahead of the ECB meeting.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index up almost 35 points or 0.4%, while the FTSE 250 is up 65 points or 0.3%.\n\nTop riser across both indices is John Wood Group PLC (LSE:WG.), up almost 10% after its board decided to engage in takeover talks with Sidara.\n\nThis followed a fourth possible offer from the Dubai-based rival at a \"final price\" of 230p per share in cash.\n\nWood's board said that while it \"remains confident\" in the current strategy and prospects, \"having now weighed all relevant factors including, in particular, feedback received from Wood shareholders, the board has decided to engage with Sidara to determine if a firm offer can be made\".\n\nSidara is being given access to the books to carry out due diligence and the put-up-or-shut-up (PUSU) deadline has been extended to 5pm on 3 July.\n\nThe biggest faller is Vodafone, down as its shares go ex-dividend, along with several others.\n\n12.05pm: ECB 'should not cut rates'\n\nThe ECB should not cut rates, reckons Alberto Matell\u00e1n, chief economist at Mapfre.\n\nEconomic data does not support a rate cut, as the \"persistence of inflation, together with the improvement in growth data we've seen in recent quarters, means that the lowering of rates in Europe isn't justified,\" he says.\n\n\"The macro situation in Europe doesn't justify rate cuts, certainly not a cycle of them. We have growth, weak as it is, and it's beginning to improve. There are other nuances, such as financial stability, but looking at the macro data, this isn't justified.\"\n\nAs other economists have said, what comes after this first small cut is almost more important, as one quarter-point reduction won't move the economic dial much, and as Matellan suggests, a big move is not warranted.\n\nComments at the meeting might give a clue.\n\n11.56am: White House Gaza statement\n\nThe White House has issued a joint statement from the leaders of the US, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada and others on Gaza, calling on Hamas to move towards a ceasefire and hostage-release deal.\n\n\"As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement says.\n\n\"There is no time to lose. We call on Hamas to close this agreement, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and begin the process of releasing our citizens.\n\n\"We note that this agreement would lead to an immediate ceasefire and rehabilitation of Gaza together with security assurances for Israelis, and Palestinians, and opportunities for a more enduring long-term peace and a two-state solution.\"\n\nThe price of gold, which has risen from $1800 per oz before the Hamas attack in October to $2400 is little moved today at $2360.\n\nOil prices, which have been up and down in that period, are up slightly today, with Brent crude futures rising 0.36% to $78.69 a barrel.\n\n11.50am: Blackout risk lessens, green investment increases\n\nAhead of the ECB announcement, most European markets are moving largely sideways after initially starting higher, including the Footsie.\n\nMeanwhile, National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) has published its outlook report, showing reduced risks of blackouts this winter, with a 9.4% margin between expected capacity and demand, up from 7.4% last winter.\n\n\"Rebalancing in European energy markets has further reduced the risk of fuel shortages for gas generation in Great Britain and increased the resilience of interconnector imports to supply-side shocks,\" the ESO said.\n\nElsewhere in the energy market, the International Energy Agency has forecast that worldwide investment into low-carbon energy is expected to be double that of fossil fuel power, having overtaken climate-damaging energy for the first time last year.\n\nA spike in solar project spending is expected to be the main engine of growth, as $2 trillion of cash is beamed into clean energy, which includes sectors such as renewables, nuclear power, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy storage.\n\n11.23am: Shein push-back from fund managers\n\nUK fund managers have expressed concerns about supporting fashion company Shein's potential flotation in London due to allegations about its treatment of workers, according to a report this morning from the Financial Times.\n\nRecent indications have suggested the $66 billion Chinese online fashion company is seeking to list in London after getting pushback in the US from its hoped-for IPO in New York.\n\nWhile a London IPO could potentially help revive a dormant market in the Square Mile, leading UK institutional investors are hesitant to invest due to allegations of forced labour in Shein's cotton supply from Xinjiang. Shein has denied these claims.\n\n\"It's a tricky one,\" one UK fund manager told the paper. \"I don't think anyone with an ESG team will be able to buy it. It smacks of desperation for the London Stock Exchange -- they'll take anything.\" He added that there is a risk of \"collateral brand damage\" for the LSE.\n\nA Shein spokesperson stated the company has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and is committed to respecting human rights.\n\n11.10am: Super-rich pack up to avoid election tax hikes\n\nBloomberg is reporting that wealthy UK residents, including foreign billionaires and City bankers, are \"rushing to shelter their money\" following Rishi Sunak's snap election call.\n\nSome are cashing in investments, paying off bills that may soon rise or leaving the UK entirely, the report suggests, having interviewed over 20 high-net-worth individuals and wealth advisers.\n\n10.55am: UK publishers' Google trial to proceed\n\nAn interesting story I missed yesterday, a potential \u00a313 billion-plus claim by UK publishers against Google over its \"anti-competitive\" advertising technology has been permitted to move to trial.\n\nThe claim alleges that Google abused its dominant position in the adtech market, causing billion of pounds of losses for UK publishers.\n\nLondon's Competition Appeal Tribunal yesterday certified the claim to allow it to go to trial, dismissing Google's arguments - thats via the Press Gazzette.\n\n10.49am: ECB preview\n\nThe European Central Bank decision is due just after 1pm today.\n\nHere are the thoughts of a couple of economists (read more here).\n\nAfter the Bank of Canada followed recent moves by the Swiss National Bank and Sweden's Riksbank in making the first interest rate cuts since the pandemic, Simon French at Panmure Gordon says Ottowa has made it easier for its European counterparts.\n\n\"Moving as a herd is an attractive feature for central bankers privately worried about being labelled the Jean-Claude Trichet of this economic cycle.\n\n\"The BoC has just made that task easier for its European counterparts,\" says French.\n\nFrancesco Pesole at ING says with a cut almost guaranteed and fully priced in by markets, the attention will be on communication.\n\nAnd while there are risks for the euro, he doubts this will be a huge event for FX.\n\n\"Unless President Lagarde revamps some of her eloquence (she has seemingly made press conferences intentionally uneventful), then the FX market may be left with more questions than answers.\"\n\nThere's also a meeting later in the day at Denmark's central bank, whose mandate is to keep stability in the EUR/DKK exchange rate, so it will likely cut rates by the same 25 bps a few hours after the ECB.\n\n10.35am: Sunak claim investigated\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has launched an investigation into a statement by Rishi Sunak that the economy is \"going gangbusters\" and that parties could misuse economic data in election campaigning.\n\nRobert Chote, chair of the statistics watchdog, said the body will scrutinise whether the prime minister's comments exaggerated the Tory's economic performance.\n\nSunak used the \"going gangbusters\" phrase after it had been used by an ONS official in a media briefing, making the Daily Mail front page.\n\nUK GDP growth was 0.6% in the first three months of the year, following a shallow recession in the second half of last year, with a decline of 0.3% in the fourth quarter after a 0.1% fall in the third.\n\n10.22am: EU retail sales\n\nEurope retail sales were down 0.5% month-on-month in April, worse than the 0.2% expected decline and after an increase of 0.7% the month before.\n\nCompared to the previous year, sales were flat, which again was lower than an expected 0.1% rise, easing from the previous month's 0.7% growth.\n\n10.05am: UK shares tick higher\n\nMomentum is positive in the FTSE 100 index, with all but three of the top 20 largest stocks in green this morning.\n\nBut with ex-divs holding the index back a little, the gain is small, up 0.2% so far, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.4%.\n\nA Nvidia-led storming run for the Nasdaq last night and the prospect of interest rate cuts in Europe today \"have all combined to put investors in a good mood,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, saying we're now \"beginning the next phase in the cycle\".\n\n\"The ECB is expected to follow the likes of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland by cutting rates later today, bringing the long-awaited pivot in monetary policy and signalling the start of a new era.\n\n\"After a long period of rock-bottom rates, the subsequent period shocked markets to the core as interest rates soared amid high levels of inflation.\n\n\"We're now beginning the next phase in the cycle where inflationary pressures ease and central banks move to a new playbook to help prop up a flagging economy and make life easier for consumers and businesses who have had to stomach sky-high borrowing costs.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve meeting comes next week (and Bank of England the week after), and while they might have given the impression they aren't swayed by what the ECB and other countries do, \"the greater the number of central banks cutting, the more pressure they will be under to do the same\", says Mould.\n\nOn the FTSE's top riser, Antofagasta and its deal to improve the water supply at a copper project in Chile, Mould says: \"Mining is a risky industry and anything a company can do to lower the risks is a positive for investors. Ensuring a smooth supply of water is important, particularly when a mine is in a remote or difficult to access location.\"\n\n9.41am: Construction survey beats consensus\n\nA couple of bits of macro data have just come out.\n\nThe UK construction PMI for May came in stronger than forecast at 54.7, up from 53.0 a month earlier and beating the 52.5 consensus estimate.\n\nThe Bank of England's monthly decision maker panel (DMP) survey for May finds UK businesses see year-ahead CPI at 2.9%, flat from the last count.\n\nThey also see output price inflation easing to 3.9% from 4.0% while businesses see year-ahead output wage growth easing to 4.5% from 4.8%.\n\nThe DMP survey gathers views from chief financial officers from large, medium and small businesses, which the BoE says it uses to monitor developments in the economy and to track businesses' views.\n\n9.09am: Big UK automotive order for US autonomous vehicles\n\nShares in Strip Tinning (AIM:STG), a maker of automotive components, had revved up more than 60% earlier after a large German auto group selected it for a \"major high volume strategic nomination\" for autonomous vehicles being developed by a huge US company.\n\nIt described the client as a \"leading German automotive motion technology Tier 1 manufacturer\", while the contract nomination is for the supply of cell contact systems for the battery pack modules.\n\nThe vehicle manufacturer is said by the AIM-listed company to be \"owned by one of the world's largest corporations and is currently running trials on public roads in three US cities\".\n\nThis seems to point to Waymo, owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google's parent company.\n\n8.52am: N Brown back in the black\n\nIt's a pretty quiet day in terms of blue-chip corporate results, but there's some mid-cap numbers out, including from Jacamo and SimplyBe owner N Brown Group PLC (AIM:BWNG), where the shares are up 20%.\n\nThe finals results from the struggling home shopping group N Brown are \"nothing to shout about\", says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, with total revenue down 10%.\n\nBut adjusted EBITDA, while nearly 13% down, are above market expectations and that the company has returned to statutory profits.\n\nCEO Steve Johnson trumpets that \"we have delivered against our strategic and financial objectives this year\", while also saying that in current trading, the rate product revenue decline \"has moderated\", with Q1 declining by 6% and \"this improvement is expected to continue as the year progresses\".\n\n8.44am: European markets up ahead of ECB decision\n\nAhead of the ECB meeting later, the FTSE's small gain is being eclipsed by those on the European mainland, with the ex-dividend stocks weighing on the UK market.\n\nThe FTSE 250 is up 66 points at 20,730.\n\nIn Europe, the DAX is leading with a 0.81% rise, France's CAC 40 up 0.40%, Spain's Ibex 0.37% and Italy's FTSE MIB ahead 0.24%. The wider Stoxx 600 has risen 0.58%.\n\n8.33am: Can anything stop Nvidia?\n\nA stunning fact is that, in just two years, Nvidia's market cap has increased more than 600%, with the chipmaker's valuation rocket past Netflix, past Tesla, past Google, Broadcom, Amazon and Meta, to also overtake Apple in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs of this moment, Nvidia is valued at $3.01 trillion versus Apple's measly $3 trillion.\n\nThe gap is expected to widen even further when US markets open today, with pre-market trades pointing to a 0.95% gain on Nvidia stock and a 0.17% loss on Apple stock, writes my colleague Billy Farrington as he takes a look at the meteoric rise of the semiconductor innovator.\n\n8.27am: Modestly positive market sentiment\n\nPositive stock market sentiment has been rekindled after an erratic May, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nInvestors will remain on \"high alert\" for further economic developments unfolding, he adds.\n\nIn the year to date, the FTSE 100 is up 6.7%, Nasdaq is ahead by 14.5% and the S&P 500 by 12.2%, Germany's Dax has risen around 11.6% and Japan's Nikkei jumped 16.3%.\n\nFocusing on this morning, Hunter says: \"The London market edged higher at the open, with tentative buying interest in the mining sector offsetting some of the more recent weakness across oil and commodity prices in general.\n\n\"Such weakness has tempered gains in the FTSE 100 after a record-breaking level was reached in May ... and despite the uncertainty of an imminent general election, the more domestically focused FTSE 250 has reversed early year losses to stand up by 5.3% in the year to date, latterly propelled by a UK economy which is seeing some benefit from easing inflation and the possibility of lower interest rates, in addition to recently having left a short and shallow technical recession.\"\n\nHe says the appetite for tech stocks is also driving many global indices higher.\n\n\"The likelihood of an interest rate cut later today from the ECB also boosted sentiment, potentially signalling a new era of easier monetary conditions across the globe,\" Hunter adds.\n\n8.16am: FTSE reshuffle confirmed\n\nIn the UK, the FTSE index reshuffle was confirmed last night, involving three demotions from the blue-chip index, with LondonMetric Property, Vistry Group and Darktrace (temporarily as it is being taken over) replacing Ocado, RS Group and St James's Place.\n\nDropping out of the FTSE 250 into the small caps will be Ferrexpo, Mobico Group (National Express) and Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust, replaced by Alpha Group International, Renewi and XPS Pensions Group.\n\n8.08am: FTSE starts higher, ex-divs weigh\n\nThe FTSE 100 is ambling higher, as predicted, rising 12 points or 0.15% to 8259 in the first few minutes of trading.\n\nTop risers initially are copper miner Antofagasta, up 2.5% after a deal to improve the water supply at a copper project in Chile, and precious metals miner Fresnillo, though it's not immediately clear why.\n\nBurberry and Rolls-Royce are next.\n\nVodafone is the big faller, down 5.8% after going ex-dividend.\n\nOther ex-div fallers include WPP, Informa, Sainsbury and National Grid.\n\n7.56am: More weak data from Germany\n\nAfter recent data showed German inflation and unemployment claims increasing, this morning we hear that factory orders in Germany fell by 0.2% month-to-month in April, below the consensus for a 0.6% increase after a revised 0.8% decline in March.\n\nThe year-over-year rate improved to -1.6%. Net revisions to the month-to-month data were down 0.4%.\n\n\"This was a good deal weaker than we expected,\" says economist Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics, but the headline number was held back by a big fall in major orders that masks a 2.9% jump in core orders, which is more in line with forecasts.\n\n7.49am: Regulator calls for scrutiny of AI sector\n\nIn a big tech story after the barnstorming Nvidia performance last night, there are reports that a major US investigation is brewing into the three major players in AI.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal that allows them to proceed with antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia are playing in the industry.\n\nThe two regulators have reached a deal to split responsibility for investigating the three major players in AI.\n\nUS antitrust watchdog also says \"urgent scrutiny\" is needed over big tech's control of AI, according to a Financial Times story, where Department of Justice chief Jonathan Kanter says he is examining \"monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape\" in AI, covering aspects from computing power and data utilised for training large language models to cloud service providers, engineering talent, and essential hardware like graphics processing unit chips.\n\nRegulators must act \"with urgency\" to prevent dominant tech companies from monopolising the market, he says, though he suggests a \"real time\" intervention can be \"less invasive\" for industries.\n\n7.31am: Fever-Tree mixes top line gains with market growth\n\nFevertree Drinks (AIM:FEVR) said it remained \"comfortable with full year expectations\", reporting market share gains and topline growth.\n\nAhead of its AGM, the company issued a statement to say that it anticipates a strong summer trading period with new marketing initiatives.\n\nIn the UK, Fever-Tree has solidified its leading position, especially in the rum, vodka and cocktail mixer categories, while in the US it boasted that its products continue to be \"the biggest contributor to growth within the carbonated mixer category\", while also growing ahead of the market in Europe.\n\n7.14am: Positive start expected for FTSE 100\n\nThe FTSE 100 is expected to hit the ground jogging on Thursday, after a strong finish on Wall Street overnight and ahead of the European Central Bank meeting later today.\n\nSpread-betters have tipped the London benchmark to add 15 points this morning, adding to the 15 it made yesterday to finish at 8,246.95.\n\nLast night Nvidia rocketed 5% to a new record higher, leading a tech melt-up, as the Nasdaq Composite index surged 1.95% and the S&P 500 jumped 1.18%, with the Dow Jones rising a more humdrum 0.25%.\n\nNvidia's continued ascent, up 154% this year, meant it topped a $3 trillion market cap and overtook Apple to become the second largest company in the world by market valuation.\n\nDriving the mood yesterday were various factors, including weak ADP data and Canada's central bank cutting rates.\n\nLower yields boosted appetite in global indices, said market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank. \"The Canadian TSX rebounded past its 50-DMA, the European SXXP jumped while the S&P 500 was catapulted to a fresh record for the 25th time this year.\n\n\"Yes the S&P 500 renewed record 25 times since this year started - regardless of the fact that we spent most of the year scaling back the Fed cut bets and are still not sure if the Fed will be able to cut rates this year at all.\"\n\nYesterday Goldman Sachs predicted a \"wall of money\" from passive equity allocations will pour into the stock market in early July, setting up a rally through the early summer.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_haill@proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "name":

Both indexes traded at all time highs. European stocks also surged to a new all-time high ahead of an ECB meeting that is expected to deliver the first rate cut in five years. Bond yields are +1 - 2 bps with the USD also rising after erasing an earlier loss. Commodities are seeing support, led by Ags and Energy; as base metals continue to underperform. Today's macro data focus is on jobless claims but unlikely to see this being an investable data point ahead of tomorrow's NFP print\n\nIn premarket trading, Nvidia gained 2% after soaring yesterday amid an endless gamma squeeze that has added several hundred billion in market cap in the last week alone, and which saw the company surpass Apple as the 2nd largest company in the world; Nvidia now just needs another $150BN to overtake MSFT as the world's biggest company.\n\nIn premarket trading, other US tech firms, including Micron and AMD also rose in premarket trading, while in Europe, ASML Holding NV and ASM International NV surged to record peaks. As an aside, Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple are now worth more combined than China's stock market. Among individual stock movers outside of technology, Lululemon rose more than 7% in US premarket trade after posting forecast-beating earnings and raising its profit outlook. Here are some other notable premarket movers:\n\n\"There is a reason tech companies are doing so well; the earnings are there, companies have been delivering on earnings,\" said Guy Miller, chief strategist at Zurich Insurance Company Ltd. \"Nvidia is a classic example. It seems extremely expensive but goes on not only meeting, but beating expectations.\"\n\nThe latest tech euphoria coincides with growing confidence among investors that central banks across the developed world will be able to ease monetary policy this year. The ECB should deliver a 25 basis-point cut on Thursday, a day after the Bank of Canada kicked off its cutting cycle and hinted at more easing to come (see our ECB preview here). Traders have also started to price more Federal Reserve easing this year.\n\n\"With the Bank of Canada cutting rates and the expectation ECB will do so, momentum behind a coordinated global easing cycle is starting to gain some traction,\" said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\n\nEuropean stocks rally to a record high ahead of the European Central Bank's widely-expected first interest-rate cut this cycle. Tech shares are leading gains on the Stoxx 600 which climbs 0.6%; other outperforming sectors include consumer discretionary, financials and health care while utilities and personal care stocks are the biggest laggards. Private bank Julius Baer Group Ltd shed as much as 5.9% on speculation that it could take over rival EFG International AG. Shares in the latter spiked as much as 10%. Here are the biggest movers:\n\nBond yields across Europe ticked higher ahead of the ECB meeting, as traders waited to see if ECB head Lagarde might offer more guidance on the path for additional easing. Wagers on further ECB cuts have turned more cautious in the wake of data showing stronger-than-anticipated economic growth, inflation and wage increases.\n\nEarlier in the session, Asian stocks advanced, as technology shares drove broad regional gains after Nvidia led a rally in US peers overnight on hopes for US rate cuts and a continued boom in artificial intelligence. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 1.4% to its highest since May 28, snapping a two-day losing streak. Chipmaker TSMC was the biggest boost, climbing to a record high as its share buyback plan added to positive sentiment amid the tech rally. The lack of a material rise in tech volatility suggests the AI rally has not reached a bubble yet, BofA Securities analysts led by Benjamin Bowler wrote in a note. \"The question is can we incorporate AI into the economy without an asset bubble ensuing? It may be hard to avoid given the likely significant but unclear way in which AI will impact the global economy.\"\n\nIn FX, the euro is little changed ahead of the ECB rate cut, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index steadied. The Swiss franc led Group-of-10 gains against the greenback, while the New Zealand dollar led losses\n\nIn rates, treasuries dip, paring some of the prior five-day rally. Bunds are also in the red while gilts outperform across the curve. Treasuries were slightly cheaper across the curve with futures just below Wednesday's highs, following similar price action in bunds ahead of European Central Bank meeting at 8:15am New York time, expected to deliver the first rate cut since 2019. US yields cheaper by 1bp-2bp across the curve with long-end lagging, leaving 5s30s spread near session highs; 10-year around 4.31% underperforms gilts by ~5bp in the sector. UK 2-year yields are richer by around 6bp on the day and lowest since May 21. Gilts outperform in sharp bull-steepening move as traders price in more aggressive path of Bank of England rate cuts.\n\nPrices for key commodities edged higher, with oil gaining for a second session after the OPEC+ group rejected increasing crude output. WTI rises 0.2% to near $74.20. Industrial metals rallied after Wednesday's slide, while palm oil steadied from a one-week low. Spot gold rises roughly $4 to ~$2,359/oz.\n\nLooking at today's calendar, US economic data includes May Challenger job cuts (7:30am), 1Q final nonfarm productivity, April trade balance and weekly jobless claims (8:30am). Fed officials remain in a quiet period ahead of their June 12 policy announcement. As noted above, we get the first ECB rate cut since 2019.\n\nAAPL: the WSJ has a long profile article detailing how the firm fell behind in AI, and detailing the revamped Siri set to be unveiled Monday. WSJ\n\nA more detailed look at global markets courtesy of Newsquawk\n\nAPAC stocks traded mostly firmer as the region largely took its cue from the positive lead on Wall Street, while South Korean markets were closed due to the Memorial Day holiday. ASX 200 saw its upside spearheaded by gold and IT with all sectors in the green but Consumer Staples and Telecoms with the shallowest gains. Nikkei 225 surged at the open and briefly rose above USD 39,000 as industrials and Tech led the gains whilst autos saw another dire session amid the ongoing safety scandal. The index waned off best levels heading into the Tokyo lunch break. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp varied for most of the session with the former conforming to the positive mood across the region whilst the latter saw subdued and contained trade within a tight range, with news flow on the quieter side ahead of the upcoming risk events.\n\nTop Asian News\n\nEuropean bourses, Stoxx 600 (+0.6%) began the session on a strong footing, taking impetus from a positive APAC session. As the morning progressed, stocks continued to climb higher, and currently reside just off session highs. European sectors hold a strong positive bias; Tech is the clear outperformer, building on the prior day's advances, with sentiment also lifted after Nvidia's market cap surpassed USD 3tln. Optimised Personal Care is found at the foot of the pile. US Equity Futures (ES U/C, NQ U/C%, RTY -0.4%) are mixed, taking a breather from recent strength in the last trading session; the RTY underperforms.\n\nToday is a first for me. I'm taking part in a ribbon cutting ceremony. No not for a new supermarket but for Deutsche Bank's wonderful new building at Moorfields in the City, here in London. The ceremony is full of dignitaries from the City, politics, the world of finance and the Lord Mayor of London. One fact to blow your mind is that the new building contains twice the amount of steel as the Eiffel Tower and yet has won many sustainability accolades. I would be confident of saying that our buildings in NY and London are now two of the nicest work buildings I've ever been in, and I get to go in many around the world. For balance I should probably say that this statement would certainly have not applied to our old buildings!\n\nThe ribbon was also cut for a brand new all time high in the S&P 500 (+1.18%) last night, the 25th so far this year. The last week has seen the index at the bottom and now the top of the (relatively narrow) one-month range. The advance yesterday came as good economic news was seen as good news for markets again, while renewed tech optimism saw Nvidia (+5.16%) become the third company to reach a $3trn market cap. So normal service for 2024 has returned.\n\nYesterday's advance was initially supported by the US ISM services for May, which surprised on the upside at 53.8 (vs 51.0 expected). That was significant as the previous month had seen the index fall to a contractionary 49.4, so the bounceback suggests that was just a blip rather than the start of a more concerning trend. This reading was also the index's highest level since last August, and the largest monthly increase since January 2023. That said, a few of the details weren't quite as strong. For example, the employment component was still in contractionary territory at 47.1 in May (vs 47.2 expected), and therefore in line with the wider narrative of a slackening labour market. The prices paid index fell back from 59.2 to 58.1 (vs 59.0 expected), as inflationary pressures came off a tad. Supporting the employment story, the ADP payroll numbers for May also undershot expectations, rising +152k (vs +175k expected), which is its slowest pace since the start of the year.\n\nThese softer elements meant investors priced in more rate cuts for a sixth day in a row. For instance, the amount priced in by the Fed's December meeting was up +4.7bps to 50bps. In turn, 2yr yields ended the day down -4.8bps to 4.72%, whilst 10yr Treasury yields saw their fifth decline in a row, down -5.1bps to 4.28%, their lowest since March. That move has stabilized overnight however, with 10yr yields (+1.9bps) back up to 4.29% as we go to print.\n\nThe rates rally and the upside data surprise supported the rally in equities, but it was tech optimism that was the largest driver. There were a few triggers for this, including the news that semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML will ship its most advanced chipmaking machine to TSMC this year. ASML's stock gained +8.10% yesterday, surpassing luxury company LVMH as the second largest company in Europe. This backdrop saw the NASDAQ (+1.96%) and Magnificent Seven (+2.24%) post new record highs. Nvidia spearheaded this rally, as the AI and semiconductor heavyweight (+5.16%) moved above $3trn market cap and overtook Apple as the second most valuable company in the world (even as the latter posted an eighth consecutive advance).\n\nThe tech advance helped the S&P 500 index (+1.18%) post its fourth consecutive gain, and its largest in over a month. But the rally was not confined to tech, and the Russell 2000 index of small caps was up +1.47%. This risk-on sentiment spread to global equities more broadly. In Europe the STOXX 600 jumped +0.81%, while the MSCI EM index gained +1.03%. Notably, Mexican equities recovered by +1.73%, following on from the +3.24% gain on Tuesday. So they've now recovered three-quarters of the -6.11% fall seen on Monday after the landslide victory in Sunday's election for Claudia Sheinbaum of the ruling left-wing party.\n\nLooking forward to today, all eyes will be on Europe with the ECB rate decision out later. This is a significant one, as it's widely expected that the ECB will cut rates for the first time this cycle, and our European economists are looking for a 25bps cut in the deposit rate to 3.75%. See their full preview here. As we go to press, overnight index swaps are now fully pricing in a cut today, so the bigger question will be what the ECB signals moving forward, and how quickly future cuts might happen. For now at least, investors don't think the cuts will happen every meeting, as there's currently only 62bps of cuts priced by the December meeting (which encompasses 5 meetings including today). So if that market pricing is realized, that would be equivalent to between two and three 25bp cuts at the remaining five meetings. 10yr German bund yields traded down ahead of the meeting, falling -2.2bps, while OATs (-2.7bps) and BTPs (-4.8bps) outperformed.\n\nWhen it comes to central bank rate cuts, there was another milestone yesterday after the Bank of Canada became the first G7 country to cut rates this cycle. They cut their interest rate by 25bps to 4.75% as expected, and there was a dovish tone from Governor Macklem, who explicitly mentioned additional cuts, saying it was \"reasonable to expect further cuts\" if inflation continued to ease. Macklem also mentioned the Bank of Canada does not \"need to move in lockstep with the Federal Reserve\", although \"there are limits to divergence\". So several central banks aren't hesitating to begin rate cuts even as the Fed elects to hold its rate steady for now. Markets are currently pricing a further 55bps of cuts by the BoC this year.\n\nThis morning in Asia, the optimistic mood for global markets has continued, with gains across the major equity indices. That includes advances for the Hang Seng (+0.59%) the Nikkei (+0.58%), and the CSI 300 (+0.37%), although the Shanghai Comp (-0.08%) is currently lower. Meanwhile, markets in South Korea are closed for a holiday. Outside of Asia, US equity futures are pointing to a positive start, with those on the S&P 500 (+0.05%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.11%) trading slightly higher.\n\nAfter a material retreat in commodities in the first part of the week, oil bounced back yesterday as prices continue to be volatile in the days after the most recent OPEC meeting. Brent crude rose +1.15% to $78.41/bbl, ending five days of consecutive declines, while WTI rose +1.12% to $74.07/bbl. Copper similarly gained +1.52% yesterday, to $460.60/lb, after having retreated by -11.4% from its peak two weeks ago.\n\nTurning to politics, in India, Prime Minister Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has managed to secure the backing from two key allies, the Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP), to form a coalition in the Indian government. The Nifty 50 rose +3.36% yesterday and closed at around last Friday's levels (before the exit polls) after a volatile week. This morning the index has opened up +0.74%.\n\nStaying on politics, the European Parliamentary election begins today, before concluding on Sunday when we'll see the first exit polls and the results start to come through. See DB's preview here from Marion Muehlberger. I'll likely do a CoTD on this this morning so watch out for it around lunchtime. Meanwhile in the UK, the general election is now just 4 weeks away, and yesterday saw YouGov publish the first poll since Nigel Farage's announcement earlier in the week he was becoming leader of the right-wing Reform UK party. The poll put the opposition Labour Party on 40%, the governing Conservatives on 19%, and Reform UK just two points behind them on 17%.\n\nNow to the rest of the day ahead. In terms of data releases, we have the US April trade balance and initial jobless claims, the UK May construction PMI, Germany May construction PMI, April factory orders, Italy and Eurozone April retail sales and Canada April international merchandise trade. From central banks, we have the ECB decision and the BoE's DMP survey, and we will have earnings from Nio.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors":

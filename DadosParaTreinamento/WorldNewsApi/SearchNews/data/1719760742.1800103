{"id": 225023300, "title": "Kano: Stakeholders demand restoration of five dissolved emirates", "text": "Some Kano stakeholders have demanded the restoration of the five emirates abolished by the State House of Assembly and the State Government. The stakeholders from Kano South Senatorial District, who made the call on Wednesday, said the move would prevent an escalation of the crisis surrounding the issue. The new emirates abolished by the government are Bichi, Karaye, Rano, Gaya and the new Kano Emirate headed by deposed Emir Aminu Ado Bayero. The stakeholders made the request at a press conference in Kano. Speaking for the stakeholders, Musa Salihu Doguwa however said they are ready to abide by court decisions on the issue. \"The sudden removal of our respected Emirs without just cause or due process is a grave injustice that must be rectified. \"The decision to amend the regressive Emirates Law by members of the State House of Assembly and the hasty manner in which it was assented to by Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf is a significant setback to the progress and development of the Emirates. \"The move not only stripped us of our heritage and potential for growth but also threatened to reverse the positive trajectory that had been set in motion by the previous administration,\" Doguwa said. He also commended members of the State House of Assembly from Gaya, Takai, Doguwa and Tudun Wada local government areas for their unwavering support for the progress and development of the emirates. He urged members of the Assembly from the Kano South emirates \"to re-align themselves with the path of progress and stand up for the collective development of their people, Kano and Nigeria\". The stakeholders equally acknowledged and appreciated the judicial intervention in the matter, which they said had brought \"a temporary halt to this regressive legislation\". \"We call on the Kano State Government and the House of Assembly to uphold the rule of law and adhere to the directives of the Federal High Court by promptly restoring the Emirates to prevent further escalation of the crisis,\" they added.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kano-Assembly-1280x720.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kano-Assembly-1280x720.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kano-Assembly-1280x720-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kano-Assembly-1280x720-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>Some Kano stakeholders have demanded the restoration of the five emirates abolished by the State House of Assembly and the State Government.

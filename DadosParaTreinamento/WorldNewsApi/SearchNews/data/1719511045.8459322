The Loose Women panellist and her husband, Joe Swash, lead a busy life at their \u00a31.3million Essex home, lovingly dubbed 'Pickle Cottage'. The celebrity couple share six children and two dogs between them. Stacey is a proud mum to Zachary, 16, and Leighton, 12, from previous relationships, while Joe is dad to 17 year old Harry. Together, Stacey and Joe have three children - son Rex, five, two year old Rose and baby Belle. On Saturday, Stacey, 34, revealed that she and Joe, 42, had adopted the ducklings from former The Apprentice star, Luisa Zissman. She shared a heartwarming video on Instagram of the ducklings settling in and receiving lots of cuddles from Rex and Rose, writing in the caption: \"Welcome To Pickle Cottage Little Ones.\" \"We are so excited to love you and we hope you love living here and being a part of our crazy family. We have no idea what to call our new babies yet, so any suggestions welcome. Honestly wanted to make our garden home to ducklings for so long so thank you @luisazissman from giving us the opportunity to raise your hatchlings.\" Then, on Sunday, Stacey took to her Instagram stories as she styled her hair and chatted about celebrating Rex's fifth birthday over the weekend. She had the ducklings with her as she mused about adding a sheep to the family. She shared a heartwarming moment with her fans as she cuddled her ducklings, revealing that her partner Joe is in charge of their pen: \"I've got the chicks with me this morning, Joe is mucking out their pen. He absolutely loves mucking them out.\" The mum-of-five is even considering getting bigger animals for Joe to tend to: \"It's made me think we could get sheep or something that's a bit bigger to muck out, because he blooming loves mucking out those ducks.\" The TV star couldn't hide her affection for the little ones, gushing over them and planting kisses: \"I love them so much, they're like my babies.\" When Stacey reached out to her followers for suggestions on what to name the ducklings, her post was inundated with adorable ideas. Fans were quick to chime in with names like \"Donald and Daisy. how cute are they x.\" While another suggested a farm-themed moniker: \"Omg it will soon become Pickle Farm. How about Pickle and Percy.\" Creative food-inspired names also made the list: \"Ham and cheese both go perfectly with pickle,\" and \"Aww so cute.

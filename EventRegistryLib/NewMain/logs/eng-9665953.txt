The center struggled and had career lows for a full season in goals (16) and points (40).\n\nDubois, who turns 26, was relegated to the Kings' fourth line in the playoffs, when they lost in five games in the first round to eventual Western Conference champion Edmonton.\n\nBlake and the Kings though were running out of time to make a decision on Dubois' future. The league's contract buyout period is 48 hours after the last game of the Stanley Cup Final. If Florida beats Edmonton, Dubois' buyout would have been one-third of his remaining base salary since he would have still been 25 years old.\n\nIf the series went the distance and ended on Monday, the buyout would have gone to two-thirds since he turns 26 on June 24.\n\nDubois also had a no-trade clause that would have kicked in on July 1.\n\nBlake said a buyout was not an option and cited that timing was of the essence to get a deal done with the Capitals. The teams started discussing the trade during last week's NHL Scouting Combine in Buffalo.\n\nLos Angeles, which hasn't won a playoff series since winning its second Stanley Cup title in three years in 2014, was in the market for a goaltender. Before acquiring Kuemper, David Rittich was the Kings only goaltender under contract for next season.\n\nKuemper, who has three seasons remaining on a five-year $26.25 million contract he signed with Washington in 2022, ended up being the backup to Charlie Lindgren when the Capitals were swept in four games in the first round by the New York Rangers.\n\nThe 34-year old Kuemper appeared in 33 games with 30 starts for Washington last season. He was 13-14-3 with a 3.31 goals-against average and one shutout.\n\nKuemper has played for five teams during his 12-year NHL career, including the Kings. He signed with Los Angeles as a free agent in 2017 and went 10-1-3 with a 2.10 GAA in 19 games (15 starts) before being dealt to Arizona near the trade deadline in 2018.\n\nBlake is hoping that the duo of Kuemper and Rittich can provide stability in net for at least a couple of seasons.\n\n\"We've had to go to different goalies here in the last couple of years for different circumstances. But, we have comfort in those two getting us where we want to go,\" Blake said.\n\nThis will be Dubois' fourth team in eight seasons. He forced a trade to Los Angeles last year after previously telling Winnipeg he intended to become an unrestricted free agent when his contract expired after the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe Jets had acquired Dubois from Columbus in January 2021 after saying he no longer wanted to play for the Blue Jackets, who drafted him third overall in 2016.\n\nGetting Dubois fills a void at center for the Capitals, who traded Evgeny Kuznetsov to Carolina at the deadline, and clears a logjam in goal. They would like prospect Clay Stevenson to either earn an NHL promotion, or the 25-year-old could start in the American Hockey League if Hunter Shepard gets the nod to play in tandem with Lindgren next season.\n\nThe Capitals are hoping that Dubois returns to his previous form. He had career highs with 63 points and 36 assists in 2022-23 and has scored at least 20 goals four times.\n\n\"We are thrilled to announce the addition of Pierre-Luc to the Caps organization,\" Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said in a statement. \"This acquisition brings in a talented 25-year-old with immense potential to become a top-tier center in the NHL.

The center struggled and had career lows for a full season in goals (16) and points (40).\n\nDubois, who turns 26 on Monday, was relegated to the Kings' fourth line in the playoffs, when they lost in five games in the first round to eventual Western Conference champion Edmonton.\n\nBlake and the Kings though were running out of time to make a decision on Dubois' future. The league's contract buyout period is 48 hours after the last game of the Stanley Cup Final. If Florida beats Edmonton on Friday, Dubois' buyout would have been one-third of his remaining base salary since he would have still been 25 years old.\n\nIf the series went the distance and ended on Monday, the buyout would have gone to two-thirds since he turns 26 on June 24.\n\nDubois also had a no-trade clause that would have kicked in on July 1.\n\nBlake said a buyout was not an option and cited that timing was of the essence to get a deal done with the Capitals. The teams started discussing the trade during last week's NHL Scouting Combine in Buffalo.\n\nLos Angeles, which hasn't won a playoff series since winning its second Stanley Cup title in three years in 2014, was in the market for a goaltender. Before acquiring Kuemper, David Rittich was the Kings only goaltender under contract for next season.\n\nKuemper, who has three seasons remaining on a five-year $26.25 million contract he signed with Washington in 2022, ended up being the backup to Charlie Lindgren when the Capitals were swept in four games in the first round by the New York Rangers.\n\nThe 34-year old Kuemper appeared in 33 games with 30 starts for Washington last season. He was 13-14-3 with a 3.31 goals-against average and one shutout.\n\nKuemper has played for five teams during his 12-year NHL career, including the Kings. He signed with Los Angeles as a free agent in 2017 and went 10-1-3 with a 2.10 GAA in 19 games (15 starts) before being dealt to Arizona near the trade deadline in 2018.\n\nBlake is hoping that the duo of Kuemper and Rittich can provide stability in net for at least a couple of seasons.\n\n\"We've had to go to different goalies here in the last couple of years for different circumstances. But, we have comfort in those two getting us where we want to go,\" Blake said.\n\nThis will be Dubois' fourth team in eight seasons. He forced a trade to Los Angeles last year after previously telling Winnipeg he intended to become an unrestricted free agent when his contract expired after the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe Jets had acquired Dubois from Columbus in January 2021 after saying he no longer wanted to play for the Blue Jackets, who drafted him third overall in 2016.\n\nGetting Dubois fills a void at center for the Capitals, who traded Evgeny Kuznetsov to Carolina at the deadline, and clears a logjam in goal. They would like prospect Clay Stevenson to either earn an NHL promotion, or the 25-year-old could start in the American Hockey League if Hunter Shepard gets the nod to play in tandem with Lindgren next season.\n\nThe Capitals are hoping that Dubois returns to his previous form. He had career highs with 63 points and 36 assists in 2022-23 and has scored at least 20 goals four times.\n\n\"We are thrilled to announce the addition of Pierre-Luc to the Caps organization,\" Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said in a statement. \"This acquisition brings in a talented 25-year-old with immense potential to become a top-tier center in the NHL. With his size, exceptional skating, and high hockey IQ, we are confident he will thrive in our organization with increased responsibility and opportunity.\"\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno

The only other goalie on the Kings' NHL roster is David Rittich, who re-signed with the team last month.\n\nThe trade is one for one, with no salary retained on either side, which will give the Kings considerable cap space since Kuemper is owed $5.25 million a year over each of the next three seasons. Dubois is owed $8.5 million through 2030-31.\n\nDubois, the third overall pick in the 2016 NHL draft, came to the Kings in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets a year ago. It was an expensive deal for the Kings, who gave up Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo and Ramus Kupari, plus a second-round draft pick, for Dubois, who was signed to an eight-year, $68-million contract.\n\nThe 25-year-old center was largely a bust, however, compiling 16 goals and 24 assists in the regular season and scoring just once in the playoffs, during which the Kings were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers in the first round for the third time in as many seasons.\n\nWith the exception of the COVID-interrupted 2020-21 season, Dubois' numbers with the Kings were career lows. Following the playoff loss, however, general manager Rob Blake said the team would not buy out his contract.\n\n\"We need to make him better,\" Blake said. \"He's had a consistent performance over his career and deviated from that this year. So it's up to us as a staff -- coaches and management -- to help him become more productive to us.\"\n\nInstead, he dumped Dubois on the Capitals, whose general manager Brian MacLellan lauded the deal. Washington will be Dubois' fourth organization in five years.\n\n\"This acquisition brings in a talented 25-year-old with immense potential to become a top-tier center in the NHL,\" he said in a statement. \"With his size, exceptional skating, and high hockey IQ, we are confident he will thrive in our organization with increased responsibility and opportunity.\"\n\nKuemper, 34, appeared in 33 games for Washington last season, going 13-14-3 with one shutout in 30 starts.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Iafallo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Iafallo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Vilardi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Vilardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian MacLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/custom/image/595a0f6c-8b6f-11e8-996b-c70bb6ec20ab.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Los Angeles takes on the final three years of Kuemper's $5.25 million AAV.\n\nAdding Kuemper's contract to the books is probably not a dream scenario for Kings general manager Rob Blake. His $5.25 million cap hit takes up 6.0 percent of the Kings' projected cap space for the offseason. It's not a back-breaking contract but it is a lot to pay for a goalie who will be 34 next season and is coming off his worst year as an NHLer, when he was replaced on the depth chart by Charlie Lindgren.\n\nKuemper's 3.31 goals-against average ranked 61st and his .890 save percentage ranked seventh-worst in a pool of 73 goaltenders with at least 10 games played this past season. It's the first time in his 12-year NHL career that his save percentage dipped below .900 and the highest GAA of his career, marking just the second time that it's been over three goals per game.\n\nHe was solid the season before, but he hasn't come close to the level he played at in 2021-22 when he helped the Colorado Avalanche win the Stanley Cup as their No. 1 goalie.\n\nStill, the Kings are in need of a No. 1 with both Cam Talbot and Phoenix Copley due to become free agents on July 1. If Kuemper can progress back to the mean, it likely wouldn't be All-Star caliber goaltending but it would at least be around League average. At that level, playing behind a Kings team that is better than the Capitals, Kuemper can form a decent tandem in goal with David Rittich next season.\n\nUltimately though, Kuemper is a necessary component in the main objective of this trade -- getting rid of Dubois' contract.\n\nThe Kings were always going to have to take some salary back in return, but the fact that they got out of the remaining seven years of Dubois' deal without any salary retention whatsoever is an impressive move by Blake and one that makes this a positive deal for the organization regardless of what Kuemper does in net.\n\nDubois was an abject failure in his lone season with the Kings, notching 40 points in 82 games, and 16 goals on a career-low 11.0 shooting percentage. By the time the Stanley Cup Playoffs rolled around, Dubois was relegated to a fourth-line role.\n\nIt clearly wasn't working, and with previous character concerns after Dubois forced his way off the Jets and Columbus Blue Jackets, the Kings made a prudent move to back out as early as possible.\n\nThe trade frees up an extra $3 million, leaving the Kings with some extra room to address their expiring contracts or potentially make a major upgrade to the roster.\n\nDubois was shaping up to be an unmovable contract, but Los Angeles figured out a way to unload it and him Again, Kuemper's contract isn't pretty, but it's a lot cheaper and shorter, and they can always buy him out in a year or two if need be.\n\nIt's a bit of a head-scratcher why any team would want to take on Dubois' contract, particularly without any salary retention. But that's what Washington did, seizing the opportunity to dump Kuemper after a rough season and take a chance on a 25-year-old center with considerable upside in Dubois.\n\nThe Capitals certainly don't have much of a use for Kuemper after Lindgren firmly established himself as their No. 1 this season, so it made sense to try and get rid of his contract. Still, it feels like they traded a bad contract for an even worse one.\n\nGranted, Washington is one of the few teams that would have a legitimate reason to acquire Dubois as a top-six center. With Nicklas Backstrom's lingering hip injury keeping him on LTIR and the decision to move on from Evgeny Kuznetsov this past season, the Capitals are pretty thin down the middle after Dylan Strome.\n\nDubois, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2016 NHL Draft, should be a lock for top-six minutes, even if he struggles. Washington made the postseason this year, snagging the final wild card in the Eastern Conference before being quickly disposed of by the New York Rangers in four games. Despite the playoff appearance, it will be tough for the Capitals to return since they'll have to compete against a medley of talented teams hungry for the two wild-card spots.\n\nIf they can unlock Dubois, who recorded 60-plus points and 25-plus goals in consecutive seasons before joining Los Angeles, it would be a welcome offensive boost for a team that doesn't have a ton of playmakers. Plus, it doesn't hurt to add an offensive-minded forward as Alexander Ovechkin enters next season 42 goals shy of becoming the all-time NHL goals leader.\n\nIt's clear that Washington will try and remain semi-competitive as Ovechkin chases history, and this is a move that will help them do that. However, Ovechkin will likely retire long before Dubois' contract is up, leaving the Capitals shackled to an ugly deal for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's just a lot of money to have committed to a player who's struggled to be reliable, both on and off the ice, in his seven-year career. Others have bet on Dubois' upside and came up empty. Let's see if that changes in Washington.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lou_orlando@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Lou Orlando",

In 2018-19, Dubois helped the Blue Jackets win a Stanley Cup playoff series for the first time -- a sweep of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He scored five points (two goals, three assists) in 10 playoff games.\n\nAfter the 2022 season, Dubois signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets as a restricted free agent, six months after he was acquired in a trade with the Blue Jackets. His 36 assists and 63 points in 2022-23 were NHL career-highs.\n\nAcquired by the Kings in June 2023 (for Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo, Rasmus Kupari, and a second-round pick in the 2024 draft), Dubois was not able to replicate his success in Los Angeles. He managed only 16 goals and 40 points in 82 games while slumping to a career-worst minus-9 rating. Dubois' average ice time of 15:42 was also a career-low for a full season.\n\nFor the Kings, the trade represents an opportunity to get out of the eight-year, $68 million commitment they made to Dubois immediately after the trade. For the Capitals, it's an opportunity to give Dubois a fresh start and bolster their depth down the middle.\n\nIt comes at the cost of Kuemper, 34, a three-time All-Star who's also coming off a down season.\n\nKuemper was 13-14-3 with a 3.31 goals-against average, .890 save percentage, and one shutout in 33 games (30 starts) for the Capitals this season. He began the season as the incumbent starter and finished as the backup to Charlie Lindgren as the Caps were swept in four games by the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIt's the second turn in Los Angeles for Kuemper, who signed a one-year contract with the Kings prior to the 2017-18 season but only played 19 games before he was traded to the Arizona Coyotes.\n\nKuemper signed a two-year contract and emerged as the Coyotes' starter in 2018-19. The performance earned Kuemper a two-year contract, which he signed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\nThe Coyotes traded Kuemper to the Avalanche for Conor Timmins and two draft picks after the 2020-21 season. With the Avs, Kuemper enjoyed his greatest success, winning a career-high 37 games and going 10-4 with a 2.57 goals-against average, .902 save percentage, and one shutout in the postseason.\n\nKuemper made 22 saves in Game 6 of the 2022 Stanley Cup Final, giving the Avalanche their first NHL championship since 2001. An unrestricted free agent, Kuemper signed a five-year, $26.25 million contract with the Capitals in July 2022. He has three years left on the deal.\n\nWill another trade prove as motivation for Kuemper? The Kings reached the playoffs last season behind Cam Talbot (27-20-6, .913 save percentage) but for the second consecutive year lost in the first round to the eventual Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers. Re-acquiring Kuemper could represent a reset for the team and its new -- and once-former -- goaltender.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

LeBrun reports it is a one-for-one with no salary involved, so this is a big deal for both teams.\n\nDubois had been hit with some buyout rumors, although the Kings front office insisted they weren't going to make that move. Dubois was also involved in recent trade rumors during the season, although nothing came to fruition and he played the rest of the year with the Kings.\n\nNow, the veteran gets a fresh start with a new team and it seems he is excited about it, per Darren Dreger.\n\n'Pat Brisson on Dubois leaving LA to join the Caps. \"PLD is currently on a plane; however, I was able to exchange with him regarding the opportunity to play for the Washington Capitals. He is very excited and looking forward to the challenge.\"'\n\nDubois signed an eight-year deal worth $68 million last offseason after being traded by the Winnipeg Jets. Now, the Capitals are on the hook for the remaining of that. For perspective, Darcy Kuemper signed a five-year deal worth $22 million in 2022, so that's a lot of money Washington is on the hook for.\n\nThe Kings reunite with Darcy Kuemper, who was most recently with the franchise in 2018-2018. He also spent time with each of the Minnesota Wild, Arizona Coyotes, Colorado Avalanche, and Capitals.\n\nDubois struggled this past season, scoring 16 goals in 82 games for the Kings. After the season, Dubois promised and vowed to be better: \"I'm committed to having a better season. I'll do anything to be better...I know I can do better. My first year in Winnipeg didn't go well, it was kind of the same thing - a lot of new things, new role, new everything. I didn't panic, I knew what I could do...I'm not panicking, I'm not stressed. Is it frustrating? Sure. Is it hard? Yeah. It was eight months or a year ago I was playing how I can play. It's not lost. I gotta get back to it, and that's on me.\"\n\nNow, Dubois lands with the Capitals in a fresh start. The Capitals got swept by the New York Rangers in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs and are determined to turn things around to make a run in the playoffs. It will be interesting to see how this trade works out for both teams, especially with the NHL Draft around the corner.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_wadleigh@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matt Wadleigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Dreger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darren Dreger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Wild", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Wild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Coyotes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Coyotes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kings-news-Los-Angeles-GM-shuts-down-Pierre-Luc-Dubois-buy-out-rumors.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The only other goalie on the Kings' NHL roster is David Rittich, who re-signed with the team last month.\n\nThe trade is one for one, with no salary retained on either side, which will give the Kings considerable cap space since Kuemper is owed $5.25 million a year over each of the next three seasons. Dubois is owed $8.5 million through 2030-31.\n\nDubois, the third overall pick in the 2016 NHL draft, came to the Kings in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets a year ago. It was an expensive deal for the Kings, who gave up Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo and Ramus Kupari, plus a second-round draft pick, for Dubois, who was signed to an eight-year, $68 million contract.\n\nThe 25-year-old center was largely a bust, however, compiling 16 goals and 24 assists in the regular season and scoring just once in the playoffs, during which the Kings were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers in the first round for the third time in as many seasons.\n\nWith the exception of the COVID-interrupted 2020-21 season, Dubois' numbers with the Kings were career lows. Following the playoff loss, however, general manager Rob Blake said the team would not buy out his contract.\n\n\"We need to make him better,\" Blake said. \"He's had a consistent performance over his career and deviated from that this year. So it's up to us as a staff -- coaches and management -- to help him become more productive to us.\"\n\nInstead, he dumped Dubois on the Capitals, whose general manager Brian MacLellan lauded the deal. Washington will be Dubois' fourth organization in five years.\n\n\"This acquisition brings in a talented 25-year-old with immense potential to become a top-tier center in the NHL,\" he said in a statement. \"With his size, exceptional skating, and high hockey IQ, we are confident he will thrive in our organization with increased responsibility and opportunity.\"\n\nKuemper, 34, appeared in 33 games for Washington last season, going 13-14-3 with one shutout in 30 starts. He has played in 389 NHL games over 13 seasons with Minnesota, Arizona, Colorado, Washington the Kings, posting a 2.61 goals-against average, a .914 save percentage and 31 shutouts.\n\nKuemper appeared in 19 games with the Kings through the first half of the 2017-18 season, going 10-1-3 with three shutouts. During the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, he won 10 of 14 starts to help Colorado to a championship.\n\nRittich and Kuemper are the only goalies with NHL experience in the organization, although Blake is high on Erik Portillo, who played well for the Kings' AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, this season.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Iafallo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Iafallo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Vilardi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Vilardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian MacLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Reign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Reign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/294/29429/2942903.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Before acquiring Keumper, David Rittich was the Kings only goaltender under contract for next season.\n\nThe Kings were unlikely to make a splash for a netminder during the upcoming free agency period because of a lack of salary cap space.\n\nLos Angeles didn't have a lot of cap room after it acquired Dubois from Winnipeg and signed him to an eight-year, $68 million contract last season. The centre struggled and had career lows for a full season in goals (16) and points (40).\n\nDubois, who turns 26 on Monday, was relegated to the Kings' fourth line in the playoffs, when they lost in five games in the first round to eventual Western Conference champion Edmonton.\n\nThis will be Dubois' fourth team in eight seasons.

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings have officially pulled the plug on the Pierre-Luc Dubois experiment, parting ways with the veteran forward in a trade with the Washington Capitals on Wednesday.\n\nIn exchange for Dubois, the Kings will receive goaltender Darcy Kuemper from the Caps.\n\nIt was a crucial move for Los Angeles to rid themselves of Dubois's contract. The 25-year-old had a no-movement clause in his contract which was set to activate on July 1. If he wasn't dealt by then, Dubois would have been owed the remaining $57.5 million over the next seven seasons by the Kings.\n\nL.A. acquired Dubois last offseason in a sign-and-trade deal with the Winnipeg Jets, whom he had grown disgruntled with. The trade saw the Kings part ways with Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo and Rasmus Kupari, as well as a 2024 second-round pick. It's clear the Jets came away as the winners of that exchange.\n\nIn 2023-24, Dubois registered 16 goals and 40 points, his worst scoring output in a season since 2020-21. Considering he's making $8.5 million annually, the production was woefully insufficient.\n\nThe Capitals will be Dubois's fourth franchise in the NHL as he prepares to enter his eighth season, having previously spent time with the Montreal Canadiens and Jets.\n\nAs for Kuemper, L.A. will be on the hook for the remaining three years of his contract at an average annual value of $5.25 million. In 2023-24, the former Colorado Avalanche Stanley Cup winning goalie featured in 33 games and logged a save percentage of .890 while surrendering an average of 3.31 goals per contest.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Kupari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rasmus Kupari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Iafallo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Iafallo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Vilardi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Vilardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3721,h_2093,x_0,y_15/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0s0kv5g03zhrk001g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 549, "textEnd": 555}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Going the other way: Darcy Kuemper, a veteran goaltender who had lost his net in the U.S. capital.\n\nThe deal was, as they say, one-for-one. Let's get into it a bit more in yet another edition of Daily Faceoff's Trade Grades!\n\nIt's impossible to look at this deal without considering the one that came before it that put the Kings into such a difficult position.\n\nLess than a year ago, the Kings parted with Gabe Vilardi, Alex Iafallo, Rasmus Kupari, and Montreal's 2024 second-round pick to acquire Dubois, then a pending RFA, from the Winnipeg Jets. Dubois immediately agreed to terms on a new contract with the Kings that locked him down at an $8.5 million cap hit for eight years. In the end, he only made it through one.\n\nThe Kings had a choice to make as they entered this offseason. Dubois has a full no-movement clause in his contract that will kick in on July 1, and with the Stanley Cup Final potentially going the distance, the Kings might not have been able to exercise a cheap buyout on the 25-year-old center. Instead, they convinced the Capitals to let them off the hook entirely without needing Dubois to sign off on the deal.\n\nInstead of having Dubois on their payroll for the next seven years, the Kings now have Darcy Kuemper for the next three. The 34-year-old goaltender is coming off a year to forget in Washington, where he appeared in just 33 games during the 2023-24 season as Charlie Lindgren stole the starter's job. That said, he can still make a difference in the right situation and is only two years removed from winning the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche. Kuemper represents a decent step up from the likes of Cam Talbot and David Rittich, who formed the Kings' tandem last year.\n\nIn essence, the Kings turned Vilardi, Iafallo, Kupari, and a pick into one bad year from Dubois and, now, Kuemper. On its face, that doesn't look very good. But the Kings avoided getting hamstrung with a sunk cost, and now they can move on having solved two problems with one deal. Not only did they send Dubois packing without having to retain salary or buy him out, but they also made sure they didn't get left without a dance partner in the goalie market -- after all, the Devils also made their move on Wednesday. All in all, they did just fine.\n\nOne last note: Kuemper appeared in 19 games with the Kings during the 2017-18 season, posting a 10-1-3 record and a .932 save percentage. If the Kings get those sorts of numbers from him again, you can go right ahead and change the letter below to a big ol' A.\n\nIt's crystal clear that Washington wants to stay as competitive as possible for as long as Alex Ovechkin is still gunning for Wayne Gretzky's career goals record. In theory, Dubois should help them with that. He's a three-time 60-point scorer who has looked like a No. 1 center in the making at various points in his career. However, he's also coming off his worst NHL season to date and is only one-eighth of the way through what might end up being the worst contract in the league.\n\nLet's assume the Capitals don't buy out Dubois right away. That would be nuts, for sure, but it's difficult to imagine the Caps having any appetite for that whatsoever. No, by all accounts, they intend to make this work on the ice. As of right now, their center depth for next season goes Dubois, Dylan Strome, Connor McMichael, and Nic Dowd. If Dubois rebounds, that's not bad.\n\nBut ... that's a big \"if.\" We've seen Dubois completely fall off the map over and over and over, from his disastrous final shift with the Columbus Blue Jackets to his protracted trade request from the Winnipeg Jets -- and now, he's on his fourth team since 2021. And at least he showed some level of promise during his tenures in Columbus and Winnipeg: Dubois finished eighth on the Kings in scoring during his lone year in SoCal.\n\nThis is as big a gamble as any team in this league has made in a very long time. If this doesn't work out, the situation in Washington could devolve from a team slowly going to seed into a complete catastrophe, maybe even one that endangers Ovechkin's record chase. But even if Dubois does rediscover his game and blossom into a 70 or 80-point scorer, does that mean the Capitals will return to relevance? Probably not. If anything, this is just a move to delay the inevitable rebuild in Washington.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at play here. We'll just have to wait and see -- or, in this case ...\n\nHey, hockey heads! Get ready for The Daily Faceoff Playoff Parlay Challenge!

This move came just one year after Los Angeles acquired Dubois in a sign-and-trade with the Winnipeg Jets. Things did not work out for the Quebec native in California this past season. And general manager Rob Blake is taking some responsibility for that.\n\nBlake addressed the media following Wednesday's trade. Dubois failed to live up to expectations after signing an eight-year contract last summer. And the Kings general manager told reporters that he could have done more to ensure the Quebec native fit in with the team better.\n\n\"Well, I don't think I did a good enough job of integrating him in the right roles on the team here this year,\" Blake told reporters, via NHL.com, on Wednesday afternoon. \"You know, I think it wasn't a great fit in that aspect for us, and we'll take responsibility for that.\"\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois traded once again\n\nThis is far from the first time Dubois has been traded. In fact, his move from Winnipeg to Los Angeles last summer wasn't even the first time. We have to go all the way back to 2021 to find his first trade. Dubois debuted in the NHL back in 2017-18 with the Columbus Blue Jackets. He broke out in his sophomore season, scoring 61 points in 2018-19.\n\nHowever, things began to unravel. Dubois was unhappy with the Blue Jackets, and expressed to management that he wanted a trade. Things came to a head rather publicly in January 2021. The Quebec native put in a lackadaisical effort during a game against the Tampa Bay Lighnting. Then-head coach John Tortorella benched Dubois due to his lack of effort.\n\nA few days later, Dubois received his desired trade. Columbus sent him to the Winnipeg Jets along with a third-round pick. In exchange, the Blue Jackets acquired forwards Jack Roslovic and Patrik Laine. Dubois spent the next two and a half seasons in Winnipeg before his trade to the Kings last summer.\n\nNow, the Capitals will try and revive his career for a third time. There is some hope that he can bounceback, and he is only 25 years old. It'll certainly be interesting to see if Washington can make it work with the Quebec native moving forward.\n\nKings add a familiar face\n\nIn return for Pierre-Luc Dubois, Los Angeles added a familiar face to the organization. The Kings acquired goaltender Darcy Kuemper from the Capitals on Wednesday. Kuemper struggled mightily with Washington last season. But he play well during his first stint with the Kings where he posted a .932 save percentage in 19 games.\n\n\"I think the goaltender in return, obviously with Darcy, familiarity with him, our goalie department understanding him and having a relationship with him,\" Blake said, via NHL.com. \"I think the duo with him and David (Rittich) can help stabilize that position here for a few years.\"\n\nLos Angeles had success banking on a resurgence in goal last season. Veteran Cam Talbot struggled with the Ottawa Senators in 2022-23, but played well for the Kings this past season. Additionally, David Rittich had a successful season backing up Talbot. Rittich is under contract through the 2024-25 season, while Talbot is a free agent on July 1.\n\nThe Kings believe Kuemper can be of service to them in 2024-25 as they look to contend for the playoffs again. Whether that happens obviously remains to be seen. Overall, though, Los Angeles had rid themselves of a poorly-aged Pierre-Luc Dubois contract. Now, both sides can move forward in the most amicable manner possible.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristin_mckinstry@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tristin McKinstry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Roslovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Roslovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Laine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrik Laine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tortorella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Tortorella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Talbot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Talbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Los-Angeles-GM-makes-blunt-Pierre-Luc-Dubois-admission-after-Capitals-trade.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 3170, "textEnd": 3176}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Any player can get stale in a certain situation. The chance to move on to a new team, with a new role, under a new coach, with new teammates, can get a player refocused and back on track.\n\nBut this trade is going to test the theory to the max.\n\nRemember, this is fresh start No. 3 for Pierre-Luc Dubois now. He was unhappy in his first home, Columbus, and got traded to Winnipeg. Winnipeg didn't work out, but the Kings were willing to believe that sunshine and a chance to play in L.A. for a good team with Stanley Cup aspirations would revitalize him. Didn't happen.\n\nSo, Dubois is on the move again. In Washington, he'll get a chance to play higher up the depth chart than he did with the Kings. In L.A., he was stuck at the No. 3 center spot behind Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault. Had Dubois played better, he might have been able to work his way up the ladder. But he didn't. It's hard not to see his one-and-only year with the Kings as an unmitigated disaster - 40 points in 82 games, zero positive impact on their results.\n\nBut Washington has turned their center-ice core over in the last 12 months and now, without Nicklas Backstrom and Evgeny Kuznetsov, have an opening in the top six. On paper, you might even think Dubois could dislodge Dylan Strome from the No. 1 spot, though that remains to be seen. That'll be a competition in training camp and presumably, at this point, if Dubois wants to get what was once a promising career back on the rails, he'll need to be more focused and committed than he was with L.A.\n\nIt's a risk the Capitals were willing to assume, because a) they see Dubois' pedigree; b) they themselves were in a position to want to move out a player who never met their expectations either. Darcy Kuemper was signed as a UFA two years ago - an off-season in which a lot of bad goalie contracts were handed out. He was coming off a championship with the Colorado Avalanche, where he provided the necessary svaes during their 2022 run to the Stanley Cup. He was a solid, stable, reliable goalie for Colorado and then OK in his first year with the Caps. This past season, he ceded the job to Charlie Lindgren. With three more years on the books at $5.25 million for Kuemper, the Capitals knew they couldn't move off from that money without taking an expensive piece back.\n\nIn effect, it was a positional swap that gives each team help at a position in an area of need. At this stage, the Kings need what Kuemper was able to provide to Colorado, a stabilizing presence in goal. It means they're moving on from Cam Talbot after one year but have brought back David Rittich to be the 1B. Kuemper will thus get a chance to regain his mojo in L.A. People sometimes forget that Kuemper had a brief but excellent run as Jonathan Quick's backup in 2017-18 - a 10-1-3 record, a .932 save percentage. The Kings traded him to Arizona at that point because they knew they couldn't sign him long-term for the dollars he expected.\n\nIt's a swap of two players, coming off underachieving seasons, and needing to be better in 2024-25. Risks are hard to assess, but in the end, what tilts this in L.A.'s favor is they get out from under an enormous financial burden: seven more years of Dubois at an $8.5 million AAV. The Kings gave up a lot to get Dubois from Winnipeg, but that's a different trade grade. Here, they salvaged something from a bad situation that potentially had the chance to get worse.\n\nKings grade: B\n\nCapitals grade: C-minus\n\nShayna Goldman: One-for-one deals just hit different. There is no list of conditions, picks, or salary retention. And player for player, Dubois for Kuemper is just a doozy.\n\nIt didn't take long for the Kings to have buyer's remorse for Dubois -- a player they invested heavily in. It wasn't even a full year ago that Los Angeles flipped Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo, Rasmus Kupari, and a 2024 second-round pick to Winnipeg for the center.\n\nDubois hasn't come close to expectations in Los Angeles, coming off his worst scoring season yet with a low 1.86 points per 60. It wasn't a matter of bad luck or poor on-ice shooting in his minutes, either. Dubois shot the puck less, set up fewer chances with his passing, and was less effective on the forecheck which all did little for the Kings' offensive creation at five-on-five. The bottom-six role didn't help, but there's a reason he was demoted in the first place. On top of that, he was a negative defensively relative to his teammates.\n\nWith all that in mind, it makes sense why the Kings wanted to find a way out of that hefty eight-year contract carrying a $8.5 million cap hit. It's hard to see Dubois rebounding enough to be worth that price, and management likely felt pressure building to make a decision before his no-movement clause takes effect on July 1.\n\nMaybe the Kings think they're killing two birds with one stone because in return for Dubois they gain cap space they desperately need (with just six forwards and five defensemen under contract right now) and add a goaltender. Management ended a bad situation before it could crush them anymore. But is it really a tidy bit of business, considering how much Los Angeles gave up for Dubois in the first place?\n\nKuemper lost his starting net for a reason in Washington, but he should have more support behind the Kings' defense. He's only a year removed from a really strong season in Washington, and he thrived in 2021-22 for the Avalanche. But at 34, can he be the answer for the next three years at over $5.25 million a season?\n\nCharlie Lindgren earned the starter's net, so it makes sense why Washington would want to shed Kuemper's contract. Bringing back a center addresses their biggest area of need, too.\n\nThe key here is that the Capitals really aren't in the thick of their window of contention. They're stuck in limbo, so they can afford to take on this kind of risk and hope that Dubois bounces back in a top-six capacity. The later years of the contract may sting, but by then, Washington's big contracts should be off the books. Maybe Dubois can regain some of his value and the Capitals find a way to flip him down the line with retention. Plus, with the team buying CapFriendly, fewer fans can dunk on them for taking on Dubois' deal.\n\nKings grade: C-plus\n\nCapitals grade: C-plus", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shayna_goldman@nytimes.com", "name": "Shayna Goldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "eric_duhatschek@nytimes.com", "name": "Eric Duhatschek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Strome", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Strome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicklas_B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicklas B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Danault", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phillip Danault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Kuznetsov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evgeny Kuznetsov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An\u017ee_Kopitar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "An\u017ee Kopitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Lindgren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Lindgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Talbot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cam Talbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Quick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Quick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Kupari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasmus Kupari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Iafallo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Iafallo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Vilardi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Vilardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Strategy", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Strategy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/02205753/GettyImages-2147816354-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 4828, "textEnd": 4834}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Worse still, he often appeared aloof and unmotivated on the ice. That malaise portended trouble for a player to whom the Kings committed the highest annual salary among their forwards for the coming season and gave a full no-movement clause set to kick in July 1.\n\nNone of that daunted the Capitals, whose general manager Brian MacLellan said he'd welcome Dubois with open arms. For Washington, the deal may represent something of a buy-low on one of the most coveted assets last offseason that became distressed after a full-season faceplant that culminated in a hapless first-round playoff exit.\n\n\"We are thrilled to announce the addition of Pierre-Luc to the Caps organization,\" MacLellan said. \"This acquisition brings in a talented 25-year-old with immense potential to become a top-tier center in the NHL. With his size, exceptional skating, and high hockey IQ, we are confident he will thrive in our organization with increased responsibility and opportunity.\"\n\nDubois competed at the World Championships for Canada and showed some of the production and sizzle that MacLellan, like three other GMs that acquired Dubois before him, described. The Capitals were also in a position of strength in goal, moving on from Kuemper after the emergence of former journeyman Charlie Lindgren as a legitimate No. 1 option.\n\n\"We also thank Darcy for his valuable contributions to our organization on and off the ice and wish him the best in Los Angeles,\" MacLellan added. \"After witnessing Charlie Lindgren's performance last season, we believe he deserves a chance to play a more significant role within our team.\"\n\nIn Kuemper, the Kings get another player whose NHL passport has been adorned with plenty of stamps, including a 19-game stint in Los Angeles in 2017-18.

However, things did not play out as envisioned. Dubois struggled with the Kings in 2023-24 to the point where he was almost traded midseason. Now, following the 2023-24 campaign, he is on the move again. Los Angeles traded Dubois to the Washington Capitals.\n\nThe Capitals acquired Dubois from the Kings on Wednesday afternoon. In exchange, Los Angeles acquired goaltender Darcy Kuemper from Washington. Despite the large salaries involved in this trade, there is no salary retention involved. A lot has been said about this move since the news became official. And with that in mind, here are our trade grades for the Pierre-Luc Dubois trade between the Kings and Capitals.\n\nKings trade Pierre-Luc Dubois\n\nLos Angeles wanted to make things work with Dubois. After all, teams don't trade three players and two draft picks if they don't believe the player they are acquiring is a good fit for them. In the end, they had a decision to make. Either keep Dubois and risk being locked into no-move and no-trade protections until 2030-31, or simply cut their losses.\n\nLos Angeles decided it was best to cut their losses. Dubois was one of seven players on the team with negative goals above replacement in 2023-24, according to Evolving Hockey. He also recorded a negative wins above replacement this past season. There is some hope he can bounce back, but that hope isn't enough to keep him around.\n\nIn return, the Kings take a much more manageable flier on Kuemper. The now-former Capitals goalie struggled in 2023-24. He finished last among Washington puck-stoppers with -7.2 goals above replacement and -1.2 wins above replacement. Additionally, he finished this past yea with -1.73 goals saved above expected.\n\nKuemper is certainly not an inspiring return for Dubois, but the return for the struggling center was never going to be great. Los Angeles simply needed to move on from Dubois and get out of that contract. They do so with this trade, and the Kings hope Kuemper can rebound similar to what Cam Talbot and David Rittich did for them in 2023-24.\n\nCapitals acquire Pierre-Luc Dubois\n\nThe Capitals desperately need to add offense this summer. Washington had one of the least efficient offenses in this league this past season. They made the playoffs with the lowest goal differential by any qualifying team since 1991. Adding Dubois to the mix, in theory, should help them. However, this is a massive gamble by the Washington front office.\n\nDubois struggled in Los Angeles, putting up just 40 points in 82 games. He even found himself on the fourth line toward the end of the season. However, there is some hope that he could bounce back. The Quebec native finished the season with zero offensive goals above replacement. That said, his expected offensive goals above replacement mark was three.\n\nAdditionally, he finished with 1.4 overall expected goals above replacement and 0.2 expected wins above replacement. This means, to some extent, Dubois could have played better than he did. So it's understandable why the Capitals wanted to take this chance.\n\nThat said, the issue stems from the salary. Washington is absorbing the entire $8.5 million cap hit in this deal. As a result, they now have just $3 million in salary cap space for the rest of the summer. Furthermore, Dubois and Tom Wilson carry a combined cap hit of $15 million in each of the next seven seasons.\n\nWashington may not have major internal business to take care of this season. That said, they do need to make upgrades to this roster if they want to compete for the Stanley Cup Playoffs again. Expecting Dubois to be the sole missing piece is shortsighted. And it's a costly expectation to have given the circumstances.\n\nDubois should play further up the lineup in the nation's capital. But he will need to have a complete resurgence for this deal to make complete sense for the Capitals. And there is no concrete reason to believe that Dubois can reach his former 60-point form anytime soon.\n\nGrades and final thoughts\n\nThe Kings receive an average grade for their part in this trade. Meanwhile, the Capitals receive a poor grade. Los Angeles needed to get out of the Dubois contract, and while Kuemper isn't an ideal fit, it's a fit they can manage. But Washington has a good chunk of their salary cap tied up between two forwards who aren't exactly offensive forces at this stage. It's an expensive bet on the potential of a player who, though has some promising underlying numbers, doesn't exactly look like someone is bound to become an elite offensive scorer within the next few seasons.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristin_mckinstry@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tristin McKinstry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Talbot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cam Talbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wilson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Wilson (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Grading-Pierre-Luc-Dubois-trade-between-Kings-Capitals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The Los Angeles Kings have traded center Pierre-Luc Dubois to the Washington Capitals for goaltender Darcy Kuemper. The Hockey Writers' Jesse Courville-Lynch believed this trade made sense, and the two teams agreed, providing a change of scenery for the two former stars.\n\nWhy the Kings Made the Move\n\nThe Kings had high expectations heading into the 2023-24 season, largely because of their major acquisition of Dubois. In a blockbuster deal that sent multiple key roster players to the Winnipeg Jets, Los Angeles expected Dubois to continue his development into an NHL star. Following the trade, he was extended to an eight-year contract worth $68 million. After scoring 16 goals and 40 points in 82 games this past season, it was clear he was not a fit in Los Angeles.\n\nRelated: What's Behind Pierre-Luc Dubois' Struggles This Season?\n\nAdditionally, the Kings struggled in net. Both Cam Talbot and David Rittich had strong advanced analytics, but they were inconsistent, frequently giving up four to five goals in a game. While Rittich is signed for one more season, Talbot is a free agent this offseason, and this trade likely cements his path to joining a new team.\n\nAlthough Kuemper struggled this past season, going 13-14-3 with a 3.31 goals against average (GAA) and an .890 save percentage (SV%), he should still be viewed as a capable starting goaltender in the NHL. He spent time with the Kings in the 2017-18 season, going 10-1-3 with a 2.10 GAA and .932 SV%. He won the 2022 Stanley Cup as the Colorado Avalanche's starting goaltender and has established himself as a top 10 goaltender in the NHL at his best. This past season was the first time he finished with a sub-.900 SV% since the 2017-18 season, largely a result of an intense workload. So, in a stronger defensive system, his numbers are bound to improve.\n\nA key difference between Kuemper and Talbot is the former's ability to limit rebounds and save high-danger scoring chances. Kuemper was one of the stronger goaltenders on the penalty kill this past season but was even stronger against shots from around the net and slot. This marks a significant change for Los Angeles, whose season ended due to their struggle to prevent goals around the net, largely the result of Talbot's performance issues. By appointing Kuemper as their starter, the Kings aim to secure a more reliable and promising goaltender in hopes of making a deep playoff run.\n\nWhy the Capitals Made the Move\n\nThe rationale for the Capitals is just as easy to understand. If you ignore Dubois' seven remaining years on his hefty contract, they are bringing in a 25-year-old center with a 40+ goal upside. Since Nicklas Backstrom is unlikely to resume his NHL career, at least anytime soon, the team is in desperate need of a first-line center, and Dubois was the most realistic path to obtaining one.\n\nCapitals general manager Brian MacLellan spoke to the media after the trade, stating \"This acquisition brings in a talented 25-year-old with immense potential to become a top-tier center in the NHL. With his size, exceptional skating, and high hockey IQ, we are confident he will thrive in our organization with increased responsibility and opportunity.\" There is no doubt Dubois is filling a need for Washington, so adding him for no significant asset made sense in the eyes of the Capitals' management.\n\nHe has spent time on three teams in his past four seasons and struggled to find a spot in any of the lineups. As well, he has had to learn three different systems while having multiple head coaches who put him in dozens of different line combinations. These struggles were especially prevalent this past season in Los Angeles as he has had two head coaches and did not play in a line combination for more than 180 minutes. Now in Washington, he is expected to slot in alongside superstar Alexander Ovechkin and find a consistent role in the team's lineup.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Dubois often found himself playing on the third line as a checking center. He was frequently shifted around the lineup, preventing him from settling in and getting comfortable. Given this, it's almost certain that he will improve next season. Unlike Los Angeles, which has several top-six centers, he will face minimal competition in Washington, providing him with an excellent opportunity to start strong next season. This should allow him to return to his natural style of play and potentially develop into the 30+ goal, 70+ point center that Los Angeles had anticipated.\n\nThis swap between two struggling players has many fans worried given their performances last season. While these concerns are fair, both players are bound to improve, and their new teams are great situations to get thrown into. Whether it be Kuemper joining a more defensively sound system or Dubois finally getting a chance as a first-line center, expect both of these players to rebound in their 2024-25 seasons.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_ostrower@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Michael Ostrower", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Talbot", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cam Talbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian MacLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicklas_B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicklas B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Ovechkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field Hockey", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pierre-Luc-Dubois-Kings-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The team announced that they have traded the 34-year-old goalie to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for forward Pierre-Luc Dubois. The 25-year-old center, who turns 26 later this month, has bounced around a few teams in recent seasons. Washington is his fourth stop in the NHL since he was drafted by the Columbus Blue Jackets with the third overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. Here is some background about the newest member of the Capitals.\n\nDubois debuted for the Blue Jackets during the 2017-18 NHL season after spending his junior career with the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). In his first NHL season, he tallied 20 goals and 28 assists for 48 points in 82 games. He was expected to be a future star for the club and was off to a great start. He followed that up with a stellar sophomore campaign in 2018-19 where he accrued 27 goals and 34 assists for 61 points in 82 games. That was good enough to be ranked third on the roster in scoring. Only Artemi Panarin (87 points) and Cam Atkinson (69 points) had more that season.\n\nIt appeared that Dubois was fitting in nicely in Columbus. Being around talents like Panarin, Atkinson, Josh Anderson, Seth Jones, Zach Werenski, Boone Jenner, and Nick Foligno among others certainly helped. He was making strides as a young player though, and Blue Jackets management might have thought at this stage that they could possibly have a core member of their squad locked up going forward. In fact, the Blue Jackets and Dubois agreed to terms on a two-year extension during the 2020-21 NHL season. It was a short time later though that things fell apart between both sides.\n\nRelated: Suggested Dubois-For-Kuemper Trade Has Merit\n\nDubois requested a trade from Columbus during the same 2020-21 campaign where he inked his new extension with the club. He wanted a change of scenery and got it in the form of the Winnipeg Jets, who were dealing with some stuff involving their own star player Patrik Laine. Winnipeg and Columbus completed a trade that sent Dubois and a third-round pick in 2022 for Laine and forward Jack Roslovic. It was a change that benefited Dubois on the scoresheet. The Jets are where he posted his best statistical season to date (2022-23). Overall, he put up the following while suiting up for the Jets:\n\nIn addition, Dubois chalked up the following in two postseasons for Winnipeg:\n\nDespite the individual success Dubois had and his important role with the Jets, he eventually requested another trade. This time, he was dealt to the Kings in what was a blockbuster transaction. The Jets acquired Alex Iafallo, Gabriel Vilardi, Rasmus Kupari, and a second-round selection in 2024. The move was also a sign-and-trade for the Kings, who inked Dubois to a massive eight-year contract worth $85 million. He was joining a squad that included Anze Kopitar, Adrian Kempe, Drew Doughty, and Kevin Fiala. Dubois was a potential missing piece for Los Angeles. He kept putting up great numbers; he just wanted out of Columbus and Winnipeg.\n\nThe lone season that Dubois was a King did not work out for the club. It did not help that the organization gave up significant players like Vilardi and Iafallo, but management in L.A. felt like they did not get what they traded and signed up for long-term. There was even discussion around the hockey world about the Kings possibly buying out his contract this offseason, even though their GM Rob Blake denied that they were considering that option. They were one season into having Dubois there. How bad statistically was his one season with the Kings? In a full 82-game regular season, he produced just 16 goals and 24 assists for 40 points. This was someone Kings management saw a future with and in the span of one season, he gets traded for Kuemper and comes to the Capitals.\n\nWhile some may not like the addition and certainly the contract is a tough part of acquiring Dubois, Washington has a chance to get a player who could be a big part of their future. The reason he moved around the first two times was because he did not want to stay with those organizations. It would be different if the Blue Jackets and Jets both wanted to be done with him, but he was the one who requested the trade. The Kings may have been a bad fit for Dubois.\n\nJust because the situation with Los Angeles did not work out does not mean the same will be the case for the Capitals. He is worth a shot and if things work out with Dubois in D.C., the Capitals have an offensive weapon locked up for the last few seasons of Ovechkin as well as many seasons of the new era after he retires. If this Dubois move does not work out though, there may be quite a few Capitals fans that are not happy with GM Brian MacLellan and his staff. Time will tell how Dubois gels with his new teammates like Ovechkin, TJ Oshie, Aliaksei Protas, John Carlson, Tom Wilson, Dylan Strome, and Rasmus Sandin among others. It could be a bad fit or the start of a special pairing between Dubois and the Capitals.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_moser@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Nathan Moser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cam Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemi_Panarin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artemi Panarin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Major_Junior_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quebec Major Junior Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Anderson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Anderson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boone Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Kupari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rasmus Kupari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Roslovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Roslovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Iafallo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Iafallo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Laine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrik Laine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Werenski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Werenski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Vilardi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Vilardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Foligno", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Foligno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Jones_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Jones (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Sandin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasmus Sandin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Fiala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Fiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Strome", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Strome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carlson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Carlson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian MacLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Oshie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

A team that hasn't been able to get out of the first round of the playoffs for three consecutive years seemed to be attached with Super Glue to an underachieving center and his anchor of a contract.\n\nLast June, Blake dug his way free from goalie Cal Petersen's $5 million albatross with a trade to end that saga. Now, on Wednesday, the Kings' embattled GM wrested himself from the remaining seven years and $59 million owed to Dubois by trading him to the Washington Capitals for veteran goalie Darcy Kuemper.\n\nZero salary retained by the Kings. A Houdini-like escape pulled off.\n\nIt wasn't easy, of course. The Kings took back a dicey contract, but they addressed another major offseason issue -- who would be the lead goalie in 2024-25? -- by getting Kuemper in a one-for-one swap. Kuemper, 34, is two years into a five-year, $26.25 million contract signed after winning the Stanley Cup with Colorado in 2022.\n\nKuemper was available because he played poorly for the Capitals last season, with a 3.31 goals-against average and an .890 save percentage in 33 games -- and lost the No. 1 job to Charlie Lindgren. Paying a backup goalie $5 million is a blight - something the Kings knew from the Petersen experience - and Washington GM Brian MacLellan had an area of need at another position. The teams swapped problematic issues. Dubois gives the Capitals a (theoretical) upgrade at center while Kuemper is a known quantity to Blake and the organization who might stabilize their net for more than a year.\n\nThe Kings have run through goalies since cutting ties with the legendary Jonathan Quick 15 months ago. Pheonix Copley. Joonas Korpisalo. Cam Talbot. David Rittich. While Blake said that he hasn't decided to move on from Talbot, a pending unrestricted free agent, it's very apparent that they're going to ride with Kuemper and Rittich for 2024-25. It's been seven years, but Kuemper was excellent for L.A. (2.10, .932) during a five-month run during Blake's first season as GM in 2017-18.\n\n\"We've had to go to different goalies here the last couple of years throughout the season for different circumstances,\" Blake said. \"We have comfort in those two getting us to where we want to get to.\"\n\nBut even though the Kings can focus on Kuemper -- and other areas to shore up this offseason -- this trade was a complete admission of error by Blake, who moved heaven and earth to get Dubois. The Kings traded a package of players to Winnipeg for Dubois, then signed him to a massive eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois dressed for all 82 regular-season games and five playoff games in 2023-24, but he didn't look like someone engaged every time out.\n\nThe Kings imagined that the 25-year-old Dubois would give them enviable center depth for a postseason run, and also set them up nicely for when team leader and top center An\u017ee Kopitar retires. Instead, Dubois gave them 16 goals and 24 assists, then made little difference in a first-round loss to Edmonton. Blake put Dubois' failure to thrive with his third team -- after his previous issues in Columbus and Winnipeg -- on himself and not the player, even when given the opportunity.\n\n\"I don't think I did a good enough job integrating him in the right roles on the team here this year,\" Blake said. \"I think it wasn't a great fit in that aspect for us, and we'll take responsibility for that.\"\n\nDubois didn't mesh with any forward grouping for any length of time. It didn't work when he was asked to drive the third line, often with wingers who were low-scoring checkers or with a youngster such as Alex Laferriere. It didn't work when he had Kevin Fiala on his left side, or during a brief trial with Adrian Kempe on his right. It didn't work when he was bumped to left wing on Kopitar's line.\n\nIt didn't work under coach Todd McLellan and, after a brief bit of resurgence following McLellan's firing, it didn't work under interim (and now full-time) coach Jim Hiller. It just didn't work, and while Blake followed through on his previous declaration that the club wouldn't entertain a buyout, he clearly entertained a course correction via trade, especially before Dubois' full no-trade clause kicked in on July 1. Blake said trade discussions ramped up at the NHL Scouting Combine in Buffalo less than two weeks ago.\n\n\"The timing to do the move today\" was the reasoning for the deal, he acknowledged.\n\nHistory will not be kind to Blake when it comes to asset management and the Dubois blunder. Gabriel Vilardi and Alex Iafallo, two of the players traded for Dubois, might not have taken the Kings any further against the Oilers, but they helped Winnipeg get into the playoffs this season, making the deal an unspoken addition-by-subtraction for the Jets. They also got Rasmus Kupari and a second-round pick. Before that, Blake dumped defenseman Sean Durzi to an eager Arizona squad to clear more cap space for the Dubois contract. Durzi thrived with an increased responsibility for the Coyotes.\n\nBut this trade is still a win for Blake and the Kings, even if adding Kuemper doesn't lift them beyond the first round and even if they end up having long-term regret over losing those assets to the Jets. The Kings gained further financial advantage in the trade by picking up a net of $3.25 million of salary-cap space. With the cap rising to $88 million, CapFriendly now estimates the Kings having just more than $23 million to work with.\n\nBlake will need that, in what might be a job-saving offseason as he enters the final year of his contract. The cap savings will be refreshing after a year of constant gymnastics to stay under the cap ceiling, which left the Kings with no space to make any moves at the trade deadline while top competitors in the West loaded up. With more comfort, the Kings can address re-signing restricted free agents Quinton Byfield and Jordan Spence, can make firm decisions on veterans such as Matt Roy, Viktor Arvidsson, Carl Grundstrom and Blake Lizotte (if they haven't already done so), and look to beef up the roster to possibly give Kopitar and Drew Doughty one more shot at postseason glory.\n\n\"And that's what we'll look at here for the next couple weeks, obviously,\" Blake said.\n\nTrading for Dubois was a mistake. Expecting that he would be the main solution to their playoff failures was a mistake. Blake has made some big ones in recent years. He's managed to fix another.

But which GM did better in this deal? Here are our grades for both clubs.\n\nLos Angeles Kings\n\nGrade: B\n\nThis trade has a chance to right a few wrongs for the Kings, but might be made more damning by the fact the Kings are just eight days shy of the one-year anniversary of when they got Dubois in the first place.\n\nBut we'll get to that shortly.\n\nThis particular Dubois trade does accomplish a few items. It starts with the Kings shedding Dubois' $8.5 million annual cap hit, which Cap Friendly projects gives the club $23.45 million in space this offseason. It provides an additional cushion to address a pending restricted free agent class featuring Quinton Byfield, Carl Grundstrom, Arthur Kaliyev and Blake Lizotte.\n\nIt also provides more room for them to potentially re-sign pending unrestricted free agents Viktor Arvidsson and Matt Roy if they elect to go that route.\n\nLanding Kuemper, who won a Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2022, is a move that could right one of the Kings' other proverbial wrongs. After going through a rebuild, the Kings are trying to make that transition from playoff team to serious Western Conference challenger.\n\nFailing to get out of the first round for three straight seasons has been the biggest hurdle in that plan. Part of that can be contributed to their goaltending situation. Ever since the Kings made the playoffs in the 2021-22 season, they've gone through a revolving door of options that has seen them use Pheonix Copley, Joonas Korpisalo, Cal Petersen, Jonathan Quick, David Rittich and Cam Talbot.\n\nThere's a possibility that Kuemper, who has three years left on his contract, could help the Kings establish the continuity that's eluded them given his postseason experience.\n\nNow as for that first Dubois trade? Fair or unfair, what the Kings surrendered to get him was acknowledged with the premise he could be a long-term top-six center. After all, part of what made him appealing in the first place was the promise of a 25-year-old top-six center with a 6-foot-4 frame, coming off consecutive 60-point seasons.\n\nThat's why the Kings traded Alex Iaffalo, Rasmus Kupari, Gabriel Vilardi and a 2024 second-round pick to get Dubois, before signing him to that eight-year contract worth $8.5 million annually.\n\nThat's also what made Dubois' lone season in Los Angeles rather challenging for his employers. He finished with 16 goals and 40 points -- the fewest he's had in a campaign that saw him play more than 46 games.\n\nDubois scored just one goal in five playoff games, as the Kings were knocked out in the first round for a third straight year by the Edmonton Oilers. It led to questions about what the Kings must do to take the next step.\n\nThe Capitals were an older team that just got younger.\n\nThey got particularly younger down the middle, at a time in which Nicklas Backstrom has stepped away from hockey to focus on his health while entering the last year of his contract.\n\nThey also may have found someone who can play a significant role in guiding the franchise forward once Alex Ovechkin eventually moves on.\n\nBut will the decision to get Dubois and the remaining seven years of his contract at $8.5 million annually work out for the Capitals? That appears to be the major question.\n\nDubois' play with the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Winnipeg Jets are evidence of what makes Dubois a top-six center. He's capable of anchoring a first or second line, while also playing a role on the power play. He's a four-time 20 goal-scorer who has authored three seasons of more than 60 points.\n\nAdding another player with that sort of offensive capability is a boost to a team that finished the regular season ranked 28th in the NHL with 2.63 goals per game, and ranking 30th with 26.5 shots per game.\n\nIt was a level of anemic output that was only amplified during the Capitals' four-game playoff run that ended with them having the second fewest goals per game at 1.75 goals per contest, while their 25.3 shots were the fourth fewest.\n\nDubois clearly fills a need. It's just a question of what version of Dubois the Capitals are getting. If they get the pre-Kings version, then the Capitals could challenge for a playoff spot next season while having a top-six center for the future.\n\nBut what happens if there's a repeat of 2023-24?\n\nIn that scenario, the Caps could be forced to exercise patience as they seek to find a setup that allows Dubois to thrive. And if they can't, there's a chance they would become the fourth franchise to move on from him in his short NHL career.\n\nThen there's the question about what the Capitals will do in net now that they have moved on from Kuemper. At present, Charlie Lindgren is the only NHL goalie on the roster, and he has one more year remaining on his contract before he hits the open market. It leaves the Caps trying to find another goaltender while wrestling with the reality of what CapFriendly projects is $3.735 million in cap space.\n\nOne option that would be on the cost-conscious side: The Caps could promote Clay Stevenson, who went 24-10-2 with a 2.06 goals-against average and .922 save percentage for the AHL's Hershey Bears this season.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_s_clark@espn.com", "name": "Ryan S.

Pat Brisson, his agent, had told the media his client would like to play for the Montreal Canadiens. That's all it took to start a media storm of rumours, speculation, and arguments between those who wanted Dubois and those who didn't. In the end, Dubois landed in Los Angeles with an eight-year contract worth $68 million. A little under a year later, he's taking off to join the Washington Capitals, his fourth team in eight years. Let's take a look at the potential reasons for which Kent Hughes wisely passed on the player.\n\nLast year wasn't the first time Dubois asked for a trade, he had also done it to the team that drafted him, the Columbus Blue Jackets. Back in 2020-21, then-Columbus head coach John Tortorella benched Dubois just five games into the season, and it spectacularly backfired when the center voiced his grievances and got himself a one-way ticket to Winnipeg.\n\nIt only took Dubois three years to decide he no longer wanted to be a Winnipeg Jet, but he was looking forward to boarding one out of town. The way he did that never sat right with me. He told the team that not only did he have no intention of signing a long-term deal when his contract expired but he wasn't even willing to sign a one-year deal in Winnipeg to reach free agency. Essentially, he figuratively speaking put a gun to general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff's head and demanded a trade. Granted, it's his life and he only has one, but he's not the only one on earth and he should still play for the team who paid handsomely to get him. Once you become an unrestricted free agent, you're free to go where you want.\n\nTo me, this is an awful way to behave and reveals something about one's character. NHL players are all supposed to act per the collective bargaining agreement and it's in that document that the age and conditions to reach unrestricted free agency are established. That was the second time the young player had decided to act as if he was the one in charge and with blatant disregard for the CBA.\n\nWhat would happen if all players in the NHL acted like this? Some franchises just could not hang on to any superstars, they'd all end up playing in sunny destinations with fewer taxes to pay. There's a reason why there's a CBA and players and fans alike would do well to remember that.\n\nThe Jets having given up Patrik Laine to obtain Dubois, understandably wanted a significant return for the Quebecer. However, shoppers wanted to get their money's worth in the deal and consequently, the signing of an extension was necessary. Back then, there were rumours that the Jets were asking for Nick Suzuki in a trade for Dubois, a proposition almost laughable, but then so was the suggestion to offer Kirby Dach instead (from 'Winnipeg Jets roster decisions: Who stays and who goes this offseason?' The Athletic, May 20, 2023).\n\nOn top of meeting the Jets' asking price, the lucky team bidding for Dubois needed to meet his salary demands as well. Considering the kings' ransom needed to get the Jets to agree to the trade, it was only logical that after Los Angeles negotiated the contract with Dubois, they passed on the terms to Winnipeg so that they could sign the extension, allowing Los Angeles to secure their man for eight years instead of seven.\n\nIn the end, the Kings gave the signing rights to Gabe Vilardi and Rasmus Kupari, Alex Iafallo, and Montreal's 2024 second-round pick (37) to the Jets and an eight-year contract worth $68 million to Dubois.\n\nRelated: Grading Kings' Blockbuster Trade for Pierre-Luc Dubois\n\nIf Hughes might have been interested, the hefty price tag must have made him walk away - and who could have blamed him? Why would Hughes want to give that kind of contract to a player who has never outperformed the Canadiens' top forward and captain Nick Suzuki?\n\nInstead of getting into a bidding war with the Kings, the Canadiens' GM wisely decided to trade with the Colorado Avalanche for Alex Newhook who he obtained at a much lower price.\n\nAfter his first and only season as a King, Dubois was traded to the Washington Capitals on Wednesday (June 19) in a straight swap for Darcy Kuemper. The Quebecer had a nightmarish season in Los Angeles. While he played all 82 games, he couldn't find his groove and from a top-six player, he soon became a third-line player before crashing down to the fourth line towards the end of the season.\n\nHis offensive production was completely unacceptable for a player being paid $9 million for the campaign; he put up 16 goals and 24 assists for 40 points. That total is the worst of his career, even as a rookie he gathered 48 points. He did end the 2020-21 season with just 21 points, but he had only skated in 46 contests that season because of an injury. The Kings were understandably underwhelmed by their headline-grabbing acquisition and even though they denied considering a buyout, they still found a way to get out of that awful contract.\n\nLos Angeles now has a $5.25 million goaltender for three seasons. Much like Dubois, Kuemper had an awful season finishing with a 13-14-3 record, a 3.31 goals-against average, and a .890 save percentage. The 34-year-old netminder has a cap hit over $3 million lower than Dubois' and his contract will be over much sooner. I can't quite understand the Capitals' thinking on this one...I guess they're hoping that it was just an off-year and that Dubois can bounce back and feed Alex Ovechkin plenty of pucks to score with and catch up to Wayne Gretzky's goal-scoring record.\n\nIn all honesty, I do hope Dubois bounces back from this and he is happy in Washington, the NHL is better when its best players are shining. For now, those who were upset Hughes did not sell the farm to acquire Dubois must be very glad the GM dodged that bullet. Often the best trades end up being the ones you didn't do...it's certainly what it looks like one year on.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey

No salary is retained on either side of the deal, per league sources.\n\nDubois, 25, notched 40 points (16 goals and 24 assists) through 82 games with Los Angeles this past season, his first with the franchise.\n\nKuemper, 34, posted a .890 save percentage through 33 games, including 30 starts, during the 2023-24 season with Washington.\n\nWhy did the Kings make the move?\n\nWell, it's an admittance of a major error on general manager Rob Blake's part given his acquisition of Dubois in the first place -- for three regular forwards that included notables in Vilardi and Iafallo, who immediately helped the Jets to the playoffs -- and the fact that the mercurial center performed poorly under big expectations during his first and only L.A. season.\n\nBut Blake also managed to offload the rest of the Dubois deal that was originally eight years and $68 million before the full no-move clause portion of his contract kicked in and addressed the goaltending position that was necessary as he only had veteran backup David Rittich under contract for 2024-25. Blake also managed to pick up $3.25 million in cap space with the stunning trade.\n\nThe added room figures to be handy for Blake, whether with re-signing pending RFA Quinton Byfield or even retaining UFA defenseman Matt Roy. It could give the Kings flexibility in terms of other moves to improve their roster, which has come up short in three straight first-round losses to Edmonton. -- Eric Stephens, Kings staff writer", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pierre_lebrun@nytimes.com", "name": "Pierre LeBrun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_andrejev@nytimes.com", "name": "Alex Andrejev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "eric_stephens@nytimes.com", "name": "Eric Stephens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_Kuemper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darcy Kuemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Roy_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Roy (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_Byfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinton Byfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Rittich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/19150726/GettyImages-2148198363-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

While his role focused more on checking and penalty killing as the season moved along, he still managed to hit double digits in goals for a sixth consecutive season after potting nine as a rookie.\n\nIafallo is an interesting case. With a contract that carries an AAV of US$4 million, Iafallo could be seen as a luxury item if he starts where he finished last season (on the fourth line), though there could be opportunities to move up the lineup again as well.\n\nVilardi was and remains the centrepiece of the Dubois trade and his impact was definitely felt in his first season with the Jets.\n\nVilardi, however, suffered multiple injuries and was limited to 47 games in the regular season, notching 22 goals and 36 points.\n\nHe returned late in the campaign, while he didn't have quite the same jump, he still put up four assists in five post-season games.\n\nThe feeling around Vilardi remains the same as when he arrived.\n\nHe's got game and if he can find a way to be in the lineup for 70 games or more, he's a guy who makes the power play much more dangerous, can play a top-line role and likely can surpass 30 goals with relative ease.\n\nVilardi still finished fourth on the Jets in goals and tied for seventh in points and his ability to generate offence from in front of the net and below the goal line on the power play, you can expect incoming assistant coach Davis Payne to lean on him when looking to spark the man-advantage.\n\nThat the Kings are cutting their losses less a one year after bringing in Dubois is an interesting development.\n\nLast June, he was viewed as the power forward who brought incredible depth for a team that already had captain Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault down the middle.\n\nAlthough he went to the big-market team he desired and cashed in with his contract, Dubois had a wildly inconsistent season and saw a signifcant drop in his ice time.\n\nThere were far too many nights when his engagement level wasn't high enough and he finished with 16 goals and 40 points in 82 games.\n\nDubois was booed mercilessly in his two trips to Winnipeg from a fan base that welcomed him after he was acquired in the blockbuster that sent Patrik Laine and Jack Roslovic to the Columbus Blue Jackets in January of 2021.\n\nThere are plenty of folks praising Blake for getting out of the contract and not having to either buy out the seven years or attach a significant asset to moving on from him -- and that take is understandable in a vacuum.\n\nPerhaps it was never going to work with the Kings.\n\nThere is no doubt Dubois left the Kings wanting more -- and that's been a feeling that multiple coaches had in his previous stops.\n\nSo what's in it for the Capitals?\n\nThey're a team in transition and finished eighth in the Eastern Conference in the first season under head coach Spencer Carberry before getting swept by the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThey're a team that was looking for an experienced pivot with potential after seeing Nicklas Backstrom sidelined by a hip injury and Evgeny Kuznetsov shipped to the Carolina Hurricanes prior to the trade deadline in March.\n\nThe thing with Dubois still comes down to his upside, some of which still stretches back to his playoff hat trick in the bubble series with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2020.\n\nWhen Dubois plays an assertive game, he can get under the skin of the opponent and draw penalties at a high rate -- even if he takes some himself while straddling and occasionally crossing the line.\n\nThat the third overall pick in the 2016 NHL Draft is joining his fourth organization before he turns 26 is something that few people saw coming.\n\nNo doubt it's a red flag.\n\nIf it ends up being a wakeup call for Dubois, he could still grow into the No. 1 centre job and be a guy who helps Alex Ovechkin break the all-time goal-scoring record.\n\nDubois has exceeded 60 points on two occasions already and flirted with 30 goals by scoring 27 twice and 28 another time, so the talent level is there.\n\nIt's always been there.\n\nNow it's up to Dubois to show that he won't be defined by the two exits he essentially forced and the one he couldn't have seen coming.", "source":

That's even more true of a beleaguered player that carries the level of risk - albeit not without potential reward, as attested to by the three franchises he's disappointed to date - that Dubois does.\n\nConsider, for example, what the final year of exemplary veteran Patrick Marleau's $6.25 million contract cost the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2019 to move to the Carolina Hurricanes, who bought Marleau out for a first-round pick and conditional seventh-rounder. Or, more saliently, there's the significant price - a second-round pick, a rostered player that became a first-rounder and a solid prospect - of the Kings dumping less than $6 million of the remaining $10 million cap commitment on Cal Petersen's deal just over a year ago.\n\nYet that brings the Kings back to last summer, when they ruminated meticulously and machinated relentlessly to add Dubois as well as retain left defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov in favor of investing in a starting goalie or other needs.\n\nA year on, Dubois has gone through a grand opening and grand closing in tight succession while left defense remains an area of need, despite Gavrikov being set to earn nearly $6 million against the cap in the final year of his contract in 2024-25.\n\nKuemper, like Cam Talbot last year, checks a box between the pipes but he's another mid-30s journeyman who landed in L.A. - for a second time in his career - less because of his aptitude and more because of his compatibility with a set of criteria narrowed stringently by cap mismanagement.\n\nIn the span of two seasons, the Kings acquired what would have been their two highest-paid forwards next season - Dubois and Kevin Fiala - and their second-best compensated defenseman in Gavrikov. Each move only drew them further from advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs, where they've fallen to the Edmonton Oilers in seven, six and then five games. Edmonton's Connor McDavid now has 42 points in 23 postseason contests, one more point than Dubois scored across 87 outings in the regular season and playoffs.\n\nThe Kings also topped off their gas tank last season, not only by parting the Red Sea for Dubois in a series of transactions that whittled down their roster depth, quality and flexibility alike, but by ending up effectively pre-spending this season's $4.5 million cap-ceiling increase on dead-cap dollars accumulated prior to the coming campaign.\n\nYet all that was already an ugly reality prior to Wednesday.\n\nAs daring escapes go, Blake threw his hat in the illusionist's ring with a deal that obviated any nail-biting about the viability of a buyout and allowed him to posture as if a buyout were never even considered. Had the Stanley Cup Final ended in six games, the cost would have been one third of the remainder on the Dubois deal, yet had it gone to seven, the price would have doubled.\n\nWednesday's trade offered only marginal savings from a cash standpoint as Capfriendly indicated the cost of a one-third buyout of Dubois's remaining salary owed would have $15.83 million, a couple eyelashes above the $14.25 million in actual salary due to Kuemper.\n\nWhat Kemper contributes in net could go a long way in adding to the value of the deal, but even as is, the money is distributed in a tidier way: $3.25 million in cap savings in Years 1 through 3, and the full $8.5 million in Years 4 through 7 rather than a 14-year variable sequence of cap penalties.\n\nThat could help the Kings get creative with the term of restricted free agent Quinton Byfield's pact. give them more options to get unrestricted free agents (like Matt Roy and Viktor Arvidsson) signed, or possibly even pursue some clearly needed upgrades in their defense and bottom six forward group.\n\nYet the Kings are short on draft capital for this season to mobilize in trades (they have no second-, third- or fifth-round selections), have hired a first-time pro head coach and may be experiencing crises of identity and leadership.\n\nCaptain Anze Kopitar said the team had to \"build a culture\" at his exit interview last month.\n\nBlake displayed a rare level of off-ice fire when he said his team had to get \"uncomfortable,\" although his regime has also striven to create an allure of unique comforts, relative anonymity and limited media scrutiny.\n\nThey're also a question of trust.\n\nLast May, Blake said it was the Kings' job to make Petersen an NHL goalie again, after a season that saw the $5 million netminder demoted to the minors. Soon after, he was foisted upon Philadelphia at a steep cost.\n\nOn Jan. 18, former coach Todd McLellan's job was safe, according to Blake. On Feb. 8, he was sacked, with that decision undoubtedly coming at least a few days prior.\n\nAt that very same time, Blake said he did not regret signing Dubois, though Wednesday's events clearly indicated otherwise.\n\nWhile dumping Dubois was undoubtedly the right move, there was near commensurate certainty that adding him at the massive acquisition and payout costs they initially did was a mistake.\n\nThat rendered the deal paradoxical, making it a massive win that also highlighted egregious errors of the recent past as well as obstacles the Kings may well continue to face moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_knoll@ocregister.com", "name": "Andrew Knoll", "type": "author",

The Flames will retain 31.25% of Markstrom's remaining salary cap and the Devils' share will be $4.125 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kings acquired goalie Darcy Kuemper from the Washington Capitals in exchange for center Pierre-Luc Dubois. The Kings used Cam Talbot and David Rittich last season. Rittich re-signed for a year, but Talbot is an unrestricted free agent who struggled in the first round against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nKuemper, a former Stanley Cup winner (2022, Colorado Avalanche) who has three years left on his deal at a $5.25 million cap hit, was supplanted this season by Charlie Lindgren in Washington. Lindgren has a year left on his deal and is eligible for a contract extension. Kuemper played for the Kings for part of the 2017-18 season.\n\nDubois, 25, disappointed in his first season with the Kings, but he's a young center arriving to a Capitals team that traded Evgeny Kuznetsov and is dealing with a long-term injury to Nicklas Backstrom. Trading Dubois and his $8.5 million cap hit gives the Kings flexibility to upgrade their roster.\n\nThe Devils' goaltending had struggled last season, leading to a big drop in the standings and a missed playoff berth. They dealt Vitek Vanecek to the San Jose Sharks and acquired Jake Allen from the Montreal Canadiens in March but it was too late in the season to make a difference.\n\nMarkstrom went 23-23-2 this season with a 2.78 goals-against average, .905 save percentage and had two shutouts. He was a Vezina Trophy runner-up in 2021-22.\n\nThe goaltending moves might not stop. Boston Bruins goaltender Linus Ullmark, a 2022-23 Vezina Trophy winner, is being mentioned as a trade possibility because Jeremy Swayman is a restricted free agent. Plenty of teams could use a goalie of his caliber, but Ullmark has a modified no-trade clause.\n\nSharks add veterans\n\nThe last-place Sharks added two forwards Wednesday to complement expected No. 1 overall pick Macklin Celebrini.\n\nThe Sharks claimed Barclay Goodrow, 31, off waivers from the New York Rangers, bringing him back to the team where he began his NHL career. They also acquired penalty killer Ty Dellandrea from the Dallas Stars in exchange for a 2025 fourth-round pick.\n\nThe Sharks won the draft lottery and will pick first in next week's draft\n\nThis

Kivlenieks died at age 24 in a tragic fireworks accident after traveling up to Novi, Michigan for the wedding of the daughter of goaltending coach Manny Legace.\n\nWhile at Legace's residence, Kiivlenieks was struck in the chest by an errant firework during a Fourth of July celebration. Fellow teammate Elvis Merzlikins was at the event as well. He was hugging his pregnant wife, Aleksandra, 20-30 feet behind Kivlenieks when he was struck.\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened by the loss of Matiss Kivlenieks, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his mother, Astrida, his family and friends during this devastating time,\" Blue Jackets president of hockey operations John Davidson said then in a statement. \"Kivi was an outstanding young man who greeted every day and everyone with a smile and the impact he had during his four years with our organization will not be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I think our players who played with him said it the best, that he always came to the rink with a smile on his face and a great positive attitude,\" Columbus general manager Jarmo Kekalainen said.\n\nDubois posted a picture of Kiivlenieks on Instagram with the caption, \"RIP 'Kivvi'. You were a great person and an unbelievable friend to have.\"\n\nThe centerman attended Kiivlenieks' funeral on July 15, 2021. News surfaced of Dubois' number change on August 5, a month and a day after Kivlenieks' death.\n\n\"I just wanted to keep his legacy growing,\" Dubois said to the Winnipeg Sun on the tribute. \"I just wanted to keep the No. 80, because he's not here to wear it, I want to wear it for him. It's the number I want for the rest of my career now.\"\n\nDubois was teammates with Kivlenieks on the Blue Jackets for two seasons (2019-20 and 2020-21) before the pivot was traded to the Winnipeg Jets on January 23, 2021 for forwards Patrik Laine and Jack Roslovic.\n\nThe Ste-Agathe-des-Monts, Quebec native began his career wearing number 18 with the Blue Jackets. He changed to number 13 with the Winnipeg Jets. He's worn 80 since the 2021-22 season with the Jets (2021-23) and the Los Angeles Kings (2023-24).", "source": {"uri": "russianmachineneverbreaks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RMNB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_oland@russianmachineneverbreaks.com", "name": "Ian Oland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat\u012bss_Kivlenieks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mat\u012bss Kivlenieks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Legace", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manny Legace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novi, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Novi, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Merz\u013cikins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Merz\u013cikins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Davidson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Davidson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Roslovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Roslovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Laine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrik Laine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmo_Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarmo Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Recreations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Recreations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Fireworks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Fireworks", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pierre-luc-dubois-number.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&original", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665953", "eventUri": "eng-9665953", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1709, "textEnd": 1717}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textStart": 1652, "textEnd": 1659}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The language was once close to dying out, but activists provoked a revival over several decades, and common Maori words or phrases are now in everyday use among all New Zealanders.\n\nThe same movement prompted a revival of Matariki, the Maori lunar new year, which was established as a nationwide public holiday in 2020.\n\nSince assuming office after the 2023 election, Luxon\u00b4s coalition government has prompted fraught public debates about race. One was over a return to English names for government agencies, many of which had assumed Maori titles in recent years.\n\nAnother was over ending initiatives that offer priority to Maori, who lag behind other New Zealanders in most health, economic and justice statistics.\n\nProtestors gathered outside Parliament in the capital, Wellington, this week to oppose the government\u00b4s plans to remove recognition of a child\u00b4s Maori heritage from the law governing the child protection system.\n\n\"We value te reo in this government,\" Luxon said Wednesday,", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldsmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldsmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1 News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matariki", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matariki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798921", "eventUri": "eng-9798921", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes we speak a different language, and then we both think we are speaking English.\"\n\nNew Zealand's Prime Minister will travel to Australia next Thursday for a two-day visit.\n\nAnthony Albanese has ignored New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Luxon's verbal dig at Australians.\n\nAnthony Albanese and Chris Luxon\n\nMr Luxon's comments came after New Zealand's Culture Minister Paul Goldsmith ordered officials to remove several te reo expressions from an invitation to Matariki, the annual Maori New Year celebration.\n\nThe invitation was addressed to Tony Burke, Australia's Minister for Multicultural Affairs.\n\nThe Maori words included the greeting 'tena koe' (meaning hello), the closing 'naku noa, na' (which became 'kind regards') and the dropping of the generally accepted Maori name for New Zealand: Aotearoa.\n\nTe reo is an official language of New Zealand, along with sign language and de facto English. After decades of decline, Te reo is increasingly spoken by Maori, partly due to hostile government policies.\n\nLuxon's right-wing coalition - made up of the conservative National Party, the liberal free-market ACT and the populist NZ First party - has reduced its role in government since taking office in November last year.\n\nThe government has ordered civil servants to stop communicating in te reo. It has also asked government departments to change their names to English. Maori names, which had become more prominent during Jacinda Ardern's government, are being dropped or deprioritized.\n\nMr Goldmsith's instruction to remove the Maori greetings - which are common in New Zealand - drew criticism from Labour, particularly as the correspondence concerned Matariki, New Zealand's only indigenous national holiday.\n\nMr Goldsmith said he didn't think Mr Burke would know what Aotearoa meant.\n\n\"It's hardly the scandal of the century. I just didn't think there should be too much reo in it... I thought, let's just keep it simple,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hipkins included Goldsmith's letter in Parliament in a series of questions to Luxon about ministerial standards.\n\n\"I would like to say to that member that in this government we value te reo,\" Mr Luxon said.\n\nMr Luxon is no stranger to Australia, having spent five years living in Sydney during his career at Unilever.\n\n\"I love Australia,\" he told AAP in a 2022 interview.\n\n\"If I couldn't be a Kiwi, I'd be an Aussie. Absolutely. I just love the confidence and optimism of the joint.\"", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matariki", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matariki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacinda Ardern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_First", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Associated_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Capital Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Australian Capital Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/New-Zealand-Prime-Minister-takes-a-brutal-swipe-at-Australians.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798921", "eventUri": "eng-9798921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

How does this affect the repeal of Section 7AA?", "body": "In my mind, if I could draw - (spoiler: I can't draw) - I'd draw David Seymour with an Atlas branded tutu whirling around Aotearoa New Zealand singing about \"human rights,\" \"human dignity,\" and \"respect\" while physically poking Maori and other undesirables in the eyes with a long, sharp stick.\n\nDisney could really do something with this. It would involve writing a story about how the protagonist and his band of merry men, Luxon, Peters and Goldsmith, finally see the light and change their ways, seeing the people they are attacking as real humans and worthy of the dignity and respect they claim to offer all.\n\nExcept in the case of David Seymour, and this government, we haven't seen that opening yet.\n\nSo let's look at where we are instead, shall we?\n\nToday we'll do a deeper dive into Section 7AA and what might be driving David Seymour's fervent efforts to destroy its existence despite evidence it saves our children. It'll also touch back on Karen Chhour's cries last week.\n\nOver the weekend, Seymour engaged in one of his favourite past times - attacking Te Pati Maori and making up stories to suit his narrative.\n\nSeymour enthusiastically rang into a cosy, right wing platform, where he'd previously shared his thoughts on \"hateful\" New Zealand media voices (he was referring to coverage of Luxon's entitled Premier House allowance) and talked about cleaning house in government appointed roles\n\nThis time he was here to give his version of events about why Karen Chhour cried after a debate about the repeal of 7AA.\n\nIt was clear the interviewer and he had pow-wowed about what he wanted to cover, so the openings were all very smooth -\n\n\"I don't think I'd be crying if someone in Maori called me a puppet\" - 'Is there more to it, David?' the interviewer intoned.\n\nBefore we look at what Seymour says, let's revisit what the grave offence to Chhour actually was.\n\nHere is the quote below - with more context - made by Te Pati Maori during a Parliamentary debate about Section 7AA - the bolded part is what Chhour took serious offence to. Mickey Savage, on here, covered it in an excellent article too.\n\n\"M\u014drena. No matter my words today, this Government will not waver in its mission to exterminate M\u0101ori....\n\nE te Minita, ka aroha ki a koe kua karetaohia e t\u014d p\u0101ti. Kia kaha r\u0101.\n\n[To the Minister, how sad that you have been made a puppet by your party. Be strong.]\n\nThe history of State violence on our tamariki is clear. Every Government institution has failed to care for our babies.\"\n\nNow those of us on the sidelines might recoil at the use of strong language, but may I remind everyone that the recent NZ Royal Commission into Abuse in Care found at least 1 in 3 of all who were in state care were abused, often violently. The largest proportion of those are Maori.\n\nIs it any wonder Te Pati Maori care?\n\nAnd will use language to express it in the face of complete powerlessness under this new right wing, coalition band?\n\nBesides the name being plaid, what I heard from people was that repealing it would help keep tamariki safer, and avoid the agency prioritising cultural background over a child's well being.\n\nWhat sane person would disagree with that?\n\nLittle did I know how superficial my understanding was.\n\nUnderneath its blase, unoriginal, and inconsequential alphanumeric title is a hell of a lot of history, pain, bondage and hope.\n\n7AA was born and put into place in 2019, after review after review found critical issues with the way we deal with Maori tamariki, and ongoing failures in state care and protection.\n\nIt performs a number of very important functions. For example,\n\nBasically, 7AA plays a key role to bridge decades of flaws in the system, it has the support of Maori, and most importantly, has been statistically proven to work - reducing the number of children going into, and staying in, state care; helping to promote more security and stability in their lives, and intervening earlier to protect children.\n\nCultural considerations and understanding is important in the same way one might realise, for example, that if we lived in India or Africa or China or America, we might appreciate cultural affinity and understanding. In fact, most people do value it and find comfort in similar language, values and outlooks - maybe without always realizing it.\n\nDr Emily Keddell, in her excellent writing, states clearly:,\n\nSection 7AA is primarily aimed at giving practical effect to the Treaty of Waitangi through several means: by measuring and reducing disparities for M\u0101ori, creating partnerships with iwi and M\u0101ori organisations, delegating functions of the Act to M\u0101ori organisations, and ensuring cultural competency of staff.\n\nNow isn't that great? A practical effect to words and intentions - that is exactly what Aotearoa New Zealand needs. Am I right?\n\nAnd it has been working. Since its introduction in 2019, Keddell outlines innumerable benefits, least of which is simple government accountability for improving the well-being, safety and stability of tamariki in its care.\n\nIt's significant to Maori for very obvious reasons:\n\nIn the world of Luxon, he might identify Maori as the primary stakeholders - and for good reason.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the findings of the Royal Commission though, it makes the case even more tragic. Many Maori went into state care, often for trivial reasons, and... the rest as they say is history.\n\nThe government wants to repeal it. It honours and entrenches the Treaty of Waitangi into the legislation, it honours and respects Maori customs and culture - and we all know David Seymour needs to recast the principles of the Treaty in his image - despite all facts, rationality, Maori dignity, and humanity.\n\nI believe it was in the ACT-National Coalition agreement, and as usual, what Seymour wants Seymour gets under Luxon and his merry bend of corporate huggers.\n\nMost submissions on the Select Committee have already strongly opposed repealing 7AA, for significant reasons: it would harm tamaraki, cost taxpayers more, lead to worse health and safety outcomes, isolate Maori communities more etc.\n\nFormer Children's Minister Tracey Martin, of the New Zealand First party came forth to say it was imperative that the government does not repeal 7AA.\n\nHer words:\n\n\"We do not have a child protection service in this country. We have a child crisis service. As a nation, we wait until there is damage done to a child, either emotionally, physically, or spiritually, before we take any action.\n\n7AA is the key to making this change to become a country that supports child protection.\"\n\nWe are grateful for your clarity and courage Ms Martin, but, I reckon the Te Pati Maori MP was right.\n\nThis goverment doesn't genuinely care for the consultation or feedback - my bet is they will do it regardless - and Maori are invariably dispensable under the new regime.\n\nAmidst these serious matters regarding our most vulnerable and smallest members of society, Karen Chhour wept last week - for herself.\n\nPerhaps the small, niggling guilt was nudging her, or perhaps she really felt like this was the right time to become a victim.\n\nI don't know but it's a real tragedy that a woman with no serious experience, and less emotional maturity, is in charge of the children. Most worryingly for me is that Chhour is large on platitudes and opinions, and low on intellectual rigour.\n\n\"A useful puppet\"\n\nYesterday, as Aotearoa's largest iwi, Ng\u0101puhi marched onto Parliament and the press descended, Chhour went underground and claimed a sick day. Hope she gets better soon.\n\nBack to Seymour.\n\nHe did something that was entirely on brand regarding the whole 7AA debate and Karen Chhour's cries - he lied about it. Just as he had lied about his connections to Atlas Network.\n\nTrying his best to change the narrative about Karen Chhour being a veritable cry baby, Seymour made up some fancy narratives to suit his cause.\n\nHe told his faithful that her cries weren't about being called a puppet at all! No, it was people bullying Karen Chhour by telling her she's not Maori enough.\n\nExcept no-one - not one person or part of the TPM speech inferred that. The debate was about the grave topic of children in care, and how important 7AA is for the Maori. Anyone else would honour and respect that pain.\n\nInstead, we saw a government make it about themselves, play victim and then lie.\n\nWe also now live in the days where future Deputy Ministers and senior Ministers of the NZ Government can literally put words in another's mouth with no repercussions.\n\nSeymour intoned madly about how some nebulous people were trying to silence Chhour and his colleagues, and how that threatened \"democracy.\"\n\n(See the pattern yet? Seymour always appeals to higher values while pushing his selfish, often false, narratives. It's actually a clever and cheap psychological trap.)\n\nAs a matter of fact, Chhour came 4th in the last election in the Upper Harbour Auckland electorate, and Seymour put her in Parliament, as a Maori woman, to serve his agenda. He could do so based on party representation, so it's a grey line, but disagreeing with any of the ACT Party folk, or supplementing them with information and context, is not the same as silencing anyone.\n\nWere it even mildly true, how would Seymour explain his whole political history - and especially his cosying up to the Atlas Network attack armies of Taxpayers Union, Free Speech Union, Groundwell and the like?\n\nThe wolf routine was a little strong, but I reckon it worked for his audience.\n\nFinally, Seymour had another go at National's House Speaker Gerry Brownlee for not holding up the standards Seymour expected of others.\n\nSeymour - the upstanding politician who exemplifies 'Do as I say, not as I do, Guy Fawkes inspiration' with every pore in his body, lecturing Brownlee about his job, was quite rich.\n\nSpeaking with largesse, as per the norm, Seymour said \"This is not about me,\" but rather his duty as a Parliamentarian to protect the \"institution\" and safeguard its rules, customs, and standards for those who will come after him.\n\nI thought, \"David, have you heard about the Treaty of Waitangi?\"\n\nFinally. Let's go to the why and real intentions of Seymour and the government's fight to repeal 7AA.\n\nI'll borrow the words of someone much wiser than I. Keddell:\n\nIf the aim was really to diminish the role of whakapapa in decision-making, the aim of repeal would be section 5, not 7AA, which is about partnerships with iwi and ensuring the state is responsible for action on disparities.\n\nThe fact the repeal is about 7AA shows its true intentions, which is to reduce rights related to Te Tiriti (particularly those that change iwi from being a 'service provider' to a Treaty partner), and the onus it creates on the government to reduce disparities.\n\nIn my opinion, it's clear - Seymour and his Government buddies consistently and strongly display the modus operandi of the Atlas Network.\n\nI think, because I've studied Atlas for many months now, the topic leads me to feel some boredom.\n\nYes, yes, that's all obvious, some part of me hums.\n\nBut it's so important to understand context and in my opinion, motivation so I'll repeat it.\n\nAtlas Network operatives and 'think tanks' i.e. lobby/pressure groups have the same MO and policies around the world.\n\nThe very excellent Jack Tame gave Willie Jackson some heat last month about Te Pati Maori's comments about the repeal of 7AA.\n\nThe more I learn, the more I see where they're coming from. TPM and Maori suck at public relations, they suck at saying kind, noble, nice sounding words, but if this is what society is about - sounding good, looking noble, while cheating, lying and stealing - then give me the bad boy clothes right now.\n\nThe Olympic prize goes to......cartoon thanks to Guy Body.\n\nAnd something not to forget, even as they try to drive fear into us -", "source": {"uri":

I thought, let's just keep it simple.\"\n\nTe reo is an official language of New Zealand, along with sign language andEnglish, and is increasingly spoken by M\u0101ori after decades of decline - in part due to hostile government policies.\n\nLuxon's right-leaning coalition - of the conservative National party, the free-market libertarians ACT and the populist NZ First parties - has reduced its use in government since taking office last November.\n\nThe government has issued edicts to public servants to stop communicating in te reo, and asked government departments to rebadge with English names, scrapping or de-prioritising the M\u0101ori names given more prominence during Jacinda Ardern's government.\n\nGoldmsith's instruction to remove the M\u0101ori greetings - which are commonplace in New Zealand - drew criticism from Labour, particularly given it was correspondence relating to Matariki, New Zealand's sole Indigenous public holiday.\n\n\"It's just a shameful act ... it's an insult, not just to M\u0101ori people but to this country,\" the opposition M\u0101ori development spokesperson Willie Jackson told TVNZ. \"Here we are trying to celebrate this language and you've got a minister acting contrary to that.\"\n\nIn parliament on Wednesday, Hipkins included Goldsmith's letter in a line of questioning to Luxon on ministerial standards.\n\n\"Well, I would just say to that member, we value te reo in this government,\" Luxon said.\n\n\"The correspondence was being directed to an Australian minister overseas and what I'd say to you in my dealings with Australians, it always pays to be incredibly simple and clear and use English.\"\n\nThe quip recalled the former NZ leader Robert Muldoon's infamous line that New Zealanders leaving for Australia \"raised the IQ of both countries\".\n\nBut Luxon's comment fell flat in parliament, with the foreign minister, Winston Peters, showing indifference and other MPs gasping or sounding notes of outrage.\n\nLuxon lived in Sydney for five years during his pre-politics corporate career with Unilever.\n\nHis son, Will, is an Australian citizen, and his daughter, Olivia, graduated from the University of Melbourne last year.\n\n\"I love Australia,\" he said in a 2022 interview.\n\n\"If I couldn't be a Kiwi I'd be an Aussie. Absolutely. I just love the confidence and optimism of the joint.\"\n\nIt is not Luxon's first Maori language-related misstep.\n\nIn December, he told public servants that wished to learn te reo they should pay for it themselves, when it was later revealed he had charged taxpayers more than NZ$3000 for his own private tuition.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

{"id": 231971390, "title": "Pupils turn to 'game-changing' period pants now 15% off to help cope comfortably with exam season", "text": "We're at that point of the year where exams are taking place across the country for pupils of all ages. Whether it's end of year tests or milestones like GCSEs, A-Levels or university exams, it is a stressful time for many youngsters. Adding to the stress for anyone who gets periods is the uncomfortable feeling of sitting for a long length of time, especially once you add in painful and distracting cramps and worrying about leakage, much less needing to ask to go to the bathroom to change pads or tampons. Teens and parents alike have praised a ground-breaking new range of period pants tailored specially for teens, hailing them as 'life changing,' and 'so comfortable you forget you're wearing them' as well as flagging a confidence-boosting lack of VPL - and a new deal can see customers get 15% off during exam season. WUKA's Stretch for Teens range is designed to feel like normal underwear but comes with built-in leak-proof technology that holds the equivalent of up to four tampons as well as odour protection which works for up to 12 hours. The range is available in bright colours as well as traditional black and a range of styles and flows to suit all body shapes and sizes from boxer shorts to traditional briefs, ensuring everyone feels comfortable. In recent years period pants and mooncups have increasingly grown in popularity as shoppers look for options that are more sustainable as well as more comfortable and convenient. Prices for WUKA's teen range start from \u00a314.99 before the discount and the stretch technology meaning it can expand by up to three sizes as necessary without causing leaks - perfect for growth spurts or bloating and meaning they're an investment that lasts.

They are comfy, she feels confidence when doing sport because she can run around without worrying about leaking. They have been a game changer and I would definitely recommend.\" A second added: \"They are amazing! My teen said they were super comfortable and did not ride up, and she slept in them all night. She is 15 and really conscious about the lines in her leggings too, so she was happy as it was invisible.\" Another happy customer, writing about her own experience, said: \"They're so comfy I forgot I was even wearing them!\" Meanwhile, a parent praised them for how easy the pants were to use: \"Very discrete and absorbant. My daughter doesn't have to worry about changing pads in school. Puts a pair on first thing and that's her for the day.\" Shoppers love the confidence-boosting range of colours and prints, with one saying: \"Not only is my teen delighted with the pants and how well they perform, she's a trailblazer in her school class where most of her contemporaries use a different brand which comes in black only. So watch out for an avalanche of orders for the colours!\" Most reviews on WUKA's site are five star but a rare 4-star response flagged one quibble with the pants: \"I\u2019m so glad I went for it with these and at a good price. They are so much more comfortable than pads and tampons. Four stars only because you can\u2019t wash with softener.\" While the range is aimed at teens, mums who've bought them for their daughters have been converted to shopping with the brand, with one saying: \"My 14 year old loves them. No VPL, super absorption and lovely and soft. What more could you want? I've ordered some for me.\" Recent research has shown that menstruating students miss an average of 54 days of education during their teenage years due to their period, something that WUKA CEO Ruby Raut says is unacceptable. She added: \"In 2024, periods shouldn't be a barrier to education. Our VAT-free undies and swimwear are now even more accessible to teens with different styles and flows to suit all body shapes and sizes, even on very heavy flow days. \"We have to help girls confidently navigate puberty and foster greater inclusion in school. WUKA period pants do exactly that helping girls focus on learning, without worrying about period related accidents or shame surrounding periods.\" To mark the launch of the new range, which also includes period swimwear, WUKA is giving 15% off when shoppers use a limited time discount code.

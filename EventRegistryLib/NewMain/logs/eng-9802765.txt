This LNG bunkering and transshipment facility, strategically located on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal, is perfectly positioned to serve the North and Central American bunker and fuel markets, leveraging its prime location for efficient supply and distribution.\n\nAt full capacity, the facility is expected to produce 600,000 gallons of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) per day, equivalent to approximately 0.34 million Metric Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA). Operations are projected to begin in mid-to-late 2027. Designed with speed-to-market in mind, the project will feature modular, land-based liquefaction equipment and an optimized storage solution. It will also incorporate a floating storage unit (FSU) with an estimated capacity of 50,000 to 140,000 m\u00b3, which will be moored within the newly expanded breakwater at the Port of Salina Cruz.\n\nSalina Cruz is set to capitalize on domestic gas supplies from the Veracruz Gulf region to access lucrative new markets along the Pacific Coast. This strategic move will enable Salina Cruz to supply LNG for marine fuel at key locations, including the Pacific entry of the Panama Canal and the major ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles in Southern California. Additionally, the company will cater to Central American power markets and provide trucked volumes within southwestern Mexico. Customers will benefit from LNG pricing linked to Henry Hub rates, ensuring competitive and stable pricing. This initiative supports Salina Cruz's expansion into high-value, diverse energy markets.\n\nGFI, a Houston-based energy industry veteran, boasts a consistent 20-year track record of supplying natural gas, refined products, and electricity to the Mexican market. Led by seasoned LNG experts with an ample of experience in project development, Pilot is set to expand its LNG delivery services to both new and existing global markets, while building a diverse international project portfolio. GFI and Pilot are poised to begin front-end engineering and design for the project this quarter, with a development and permitting timeline expected to span 12 to 18 months. Both partners aim to announce a Final Investment Decision (FID) in the latter half of 2025, marking a significant milestone in their strategic expansion efforts.\n\nGomez highlighted the dual benefits of the planned infrastructure in Salina Cruz, noting that it will not only supply LNG to markets seeking cleaner energy but also generate significant community investment. He expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration with Pilot, emphasizing their expertise in LNG and marine operations as a key asset to the project. Jonathan Cook, CEO of Pilot, echoed this sentiment, praising GFI's deep local ties and commitment to infrastructure development. Cook emphasized that their partnership with GFI will enhance the project's progress, leveraging GFI's understanding of the community and government to ensure successful execution.", "source": {"uri":

He believes they will be delayed, and some even canceled.\n\nHe attributed the project delays to the 'unrealistic' expectations of having multiple FSRU terminals in operation. Additionally, he stated that Greece aimed to boost its LNG terminals not only to meet domestic needs but also to serve the southeastern European market.\n\n'So now, with Russian gas being so cheap, there's a lack of interest,' he said, noting it is 'temporary.'\n\nCiting the EU's 2027 deadline to become independent of Russian gas imports, Stambolis said this would be challenging due to the low price.\n\n'Right now, Russian gas in Europe is much cheaper than LNG and a lot of companies are returning to use Russian gas because of the price,' he explained.\n\nFurthermore, he added that over the past few months, more than half of Greece's gas imports have originated from Russia, which is a contrast to the situation just 18 months ago.\n\n'So, we have a problem because of the cost. That's a big challenge,' he stated.\n\nAccording to Jaller-Makarewicz, although EU gas demand was expected to make a slight recovery this year, the opposite has occurred, as Europe's LNG imports 'keep falling.'\n\nShe explained that Europe's LNG imports, which include those of the EU, as well as the UK, Norway, and T\u00fcrkiye, decreased by 20% year-on-year to 72.6 bcm, while the imports of the EU alone fell 11% year-on-year to 60.1 bcm in the first half of the year.\n\n'Gas and LNG demand are expected to keep decreasing in the coming years, which raises questions about whether new LNG terminals are needed or not,' she added.\n\n'A boom in global LNG production and Russian natural gas intended to be exported to Europe might be at risk of reduced European gas demand in the near future,' Jaller-Makarewicz said.\n\n- T\u00fcrkiye and Greece can strengthen Europe's energy security\n\nStambolis emphasized that Greece's investment in LNG infrastructure is strategically sound, given the International Energy Agency's forecast of increased LNG capacity and expected lower prices after 2025.\n\nHowever, Greek Environment and Energy Minister Theodoros Skylakakis expressed doubt about the proposed floating LNG storage unit in the Pagasetic Gulf during a parliamentary speech. He cited economic and political challenges as the reasons behind the potential setback, as reported by Greek daily Kathimerini last month.\n\n'Greece has covered -- has more than covered -- its needs in LNG through the Revithoussa and Alexandroupolis stations,' Skylakakis stated.\n\nStambolis disagreed with the Greek minister, asserting that Greece will require more LNG capacity to serve the regional market. He believes that having five FSRU terminals may be 'a lot' but suggests that two or three would be necessary.\n\nOn the Greek minister's remarks, Jaller-Makarewicz commented it remained 'uncertain' whether additional projects would move forward.\n\n'These additional terminals were planned to supply gas to Greece as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova, and Ukraine,' she added.\n\nDespite setbacks in Greece's pursuit of a key role in LNG, particularly in southern Europe, Stambolis believes that strengthening energy security is not only a national priority but also a crucial regional one.\n\nHe added that T\u00fcrkiye, in cooperation with Greece, can enhance energy security for southeastern Europe and the rest of the continent.", "source": {"uri": "energia.gr",

It also manages close to 30 LNG dual-fuel ships and presently two LNG bunker vessels, with more coming into management soon.\n\nAll BSM vessels under management undergo reviews and audits from Oil Companies International Marine Forum's (OCIMF) Tanker Management and Self-Assessment (TMSA) to ensure full compliance with International Safety Management (ISM) requirements, with no major safety incidents reported to date. These in-depth safety credentials is also expected to enhance SEA-LNG coalition's combined skillset.\n\nLNG as a marine fuel requires rigorous training standards for seafarers and shoreside crew to ensure safe and efficient vessel operation. BSM has its own dedicated LNG training facilities for realistic training via Liquid Cargo Simulators (LCS) designed and developed by BSM's in-house technical team that uses SEA-LNG member GTT's Training software.\n\nBSM also operates an LNG Competence Centre (LCC), providing consultancy services across a wide range of LNG industry topics, including technical, crewing and commercial matters.\n\nNick Topham, Managing Director of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement Germany, said: \"At BSM, we are committed to LNG as a marine fuel.\n\n\"It is a proven, technically mature solution already being used on many ships, offering comprehensively developed supply and bunkering infrastructure.\n\n\"SEA-LNG provides an important network for exchanging ideas and pooling expertise with other stakeholders, jointly advancing LNG-related projects.\"\n\nREAD: GTT to design CMA CGM's 12 LNG-fuelled containerships\n\nPeter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG, said: \"BSM joining represents a significant milestone for SEA-LNG.\n\n\"We welcome our first ship manager into the coalition, adding valuable insight and many years of experience in LNG as a marine fuel.\n\n\"BSM has been at the forefront of using LNG operationally for decades, with no major safety incidents in port or at sea, ensuring safe operations for seafarers today.\"\n\nLast month, H\u00f6egh LNG signed an agreement with Deutsche ReGas, a company in the European energy infrastructure sector and operator of privately financed LNG terminals in Germany, to realise the world's first floating green ammonia cracker.\n\nMore recently, Mitsui O.S.K.

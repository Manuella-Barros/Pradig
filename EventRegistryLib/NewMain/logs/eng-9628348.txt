There have been a total of three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in Mexico as scientists have so far been unable to find a connection to the victim who died April 24.\n\nThe man was hospitalized in Mexico City with a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea and nausea, according to WHO. His relatives reported he \"had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\"\n\nThe U.N. agency said lab results confirmed it was the first human H5 virus infection reported in Mexico and the first human death of someone infected with the avian influenza subtype H5N2.\n\nMexico's health ministry issued a statement Wednesday saying the man, who officials did not identify, had several underlying medical conditions before contracting the strain. The ministry said all people who had contact with him have tested negative with no evidence of person-to-person transmission.\n\nAt this point, the risk of the bird flu virus to Mexico's general population is low. \"This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza,\" according to the health organization.\n\nThe bird flu strain in Mexico, H5N2, is unrelated to the strain of bird flu in the United States, called H5N1 that infected three dairy farm workers who were exposed to cattle.\n\nLast week, CSL Seqirus announced it is preparing nearly 5 million doses of vaccine against H5N1 avian flu for possible use in humans \"later this summer.\" The new vaccine combines an antigen that targets the H5 portion of H5N1 with an ingredient to boost the immune response.\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to public health is low as human cases of bird flu in the United States are rare, they have occurred \"sporadically worldwide.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\nThere are numerous types of bird flu. H5N2 is not the same as the H5N1 strain that has resulted in three farm workers in the United States becoming ill in recent months.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the US.\n\nAccording to family members, the WHO statement read, the patient had been bedridden for unrelated reasons before developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea on April 17.

The government said the cases did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health.\n\nAfter the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said.\n\nMexico's Health Ministry said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the case and farms near the victim's home were monitored.\n\nOther people in contact with the person tested negative for bird flu, the health ministry and the WHO said.\n\nBird flu has infected mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nScientists are on alert for changes in the virus that could signal it is adapting to spread more easily among humans.\n\nThe United States has reported three cases of H5N1 human infection after exposure to cows since an outbreak was detected in dairy cattle in March. Two had symptoms of conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms.\n\nAlthough the death in Mexico was not the same strain as the one that is currently infecting cattle in the United States, they are both H5 avian viruses.\n\nPekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans\", Pekosz said.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission.

It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.

There are numerous types of bird flu. H5N2 is not the same strain that has infected multiple dairy cow herds in the U.S. That strain is called H5N1 and three farmworkers have gotten mild infections.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMexican health officials alerted the WHO that a 59-year-old man who died in a Mexico City hospital had the virus despite no known exposure to poultry or other animals.\n\nAccording to family members, the WHO release said, the patient had been bedridden for unrelated reasons before developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea on April 17. Mexico's public health department said in a statement that he had underlying ailments, including chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nHospital care was sought on April 24 and the man died the same day. Initial tests showed an unidentified type of flu that subsequent weeks of lab testing confirmed was H5N2.\n\nThe WHO said the risk to people in Mexico is low, and that no further human cases have been discovered so far despite testing people who came in contact with the deceased at home and in the hospital. There had been three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in nearby parts of Mexico in March but authorities haven't been able to find a connection.

According to The Guardian, on Wednesday, the WHO said it doesn't know how the man got infected with the virus.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" it said in a statement. Scientists, the report said, are closely monitoring any mutations in the virus that may indicate it's adapting to spread more easily among humans.\n\nHowever, the UN agency said the current risk from bird flu virus to the general population is low.\n\nThe 59-year-old Mexican man, who suffered from prior health complications, was hospitalised in Mexico City, and died on April 24, after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general discomfort, the WHO said, as quoted in a Reuters report. According to the WHO, this marked the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.\n\nIn a statement, Mexico's health ministry stated that there had been no evidence of person-to-person transmission of bird flu in the case of the man, and that he had several prior health conditions. Mexico's health ministry said the person had chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.

The government said the cases did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health.\n\nAfter the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said.\n\nMexico's Health Ministry said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the case and farms near the victim's home were monitored.\n\nOther people in contact with the person tested negative for bird flu, the health ministry and the WHO said.\n\nBird flu has infected mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nScientists are on alert for changes in the virus that could signal it is adapting to spread more easily among humans.\n\nThe United States has reported three cases of H5N1 human infection after exposure to cows since an outbreak was detected in dairy cattle in March. Two had symptoms of conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms.\n\nAlthough the death in Mexico was not the same strain as the one that is currently infecting cattle in the United States, they are both H5 avian viruses.\n\nPekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,\" Pekosz said.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.\n\n(Reporting by Urvi Dugar and Puyaan Singh in Bengaluru, Ana Isabel Martinez and Sarah Morland in Mexico City;

Seventeen people who were at the hospital where the man died were monitored, with health officials only reporting a runny nose in one of them between April 28-29.\n\nAdditionally, 12 other people were identified as having been \"near\" the man's home before his hospitalization and death, according to the WHO.\n\nSeven of those people were symptomatic and five asymptomatic, however, all of those individuals subsequently tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B.\n\nDespite the man's death, the UN agency said Wednesday that -- based on available information -- the current risk to the general population posed by this virus is low.\n\nThe WHO also said the case is unrelated to a different outbreak of bird flu, H5N1, that has been detected in the United States, although both are H5 avian viruses.\n\nAlong with the United States and Mexico, Australia has also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection this year, with health officials stating in May that there were no signs of transmission.\n\nHealth officials in the country have, however, found additional poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com",

Two had symptoms of conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms.\n\nAlthough the death in Mexico was not the same strain as the one that is currently infecting cattle in the United States, they are both H5 avian viruses.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of H5N1 infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.\n\nIn January, a British-led team of scientists identified the highly contagious H5N1 virus in the sub-Antarctica region for the first time - in dead elephant and fur seals on the island of South Georgia.\n\nBird flu has infected mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nPekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,\" Mr Pekosz said.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alannah_francis@inews.co.uk", "name": "Alannah Francis", "type":

(Daniel Becerril/Reuters)\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on Wednesday the first known case of a human death resulting from an infection with the A(H5N2) variant of avian influenza, also known as bird flu.\n\nThe individual, a 59-year-old resident of Mexico, first developed a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and a general feeling of discomfort on April 17, according to the public health agency.\n\nHe was subsequently hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City on April 24 and died later that day.\n\nTesting conducted on the day he was hospitalized indicated the individual had a \"non-subtypeable influenza A virus\" and further testing led to a positive sample for influenza A(H5N2), the UN agency said.\n\nThe individual had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals at the time of his hospitalization, the WHO noted.\n\nHowever, the man had prior health complications including multiple underlying medical conditions, and relatives told hospital staff that he had been bedridden for three weeks before his admission for \"other reasons.\"\n\nMexico's health ministry said in a statement that the person had chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and systemic hypertension.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted the WHO for further comment.\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, is a highly contagious viral disease that primarily affects birds. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the disease has also been found in other animals, such as pigs and dogs in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, as well as domestic cats in Germany.\n\nIt spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure, and it can prove deadly in domestic poultry.\n\nWhile it is unclear how the Mexico resident became infected, multiple cases of avian influenza have been reported in the country in recent months, including one outbreak detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n in March.\n\nAnother outbreak was identified in March in poultry in Texcoco, in the State of Mexico, and another in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state, the health body said.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" the WHO said Wednesday.\n\nThe latest discovery marks the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico, according to the UN body.\n\nNo further cases of the virus were reported during an epidemiological investigation into the latest case. Seventeen people who were at the hospital where the man died were monitored, with health officials only reporting a runny nose in one of them between April 28-29.\n\nNone of those individuals tested positive for influenza or SARS-CoV 2, the healthy body noted.\n\nAdditionally, 12 other people were identified as having been \"near\" the man's home before his hospitalization and death, according to the WHO.\n\nSeven of those people were symptomatic and five asymptomatic, however, all of those individuals subsequently tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B.\n\nDespite the man's death, the UN agency said Wednesday that -- based on available information -- the current risk to the general population posed by this virus is low.\n\nThe WHO also said the case is unrelated to a different outbreak of bird flu, H5N1, that has been detected in the United States, although both are H5 avian viruses.\n\nThat outbreak has so far infected three individuals; all of whom were dairy farm workers.\n\nAlong with the United States and Mexico, Australia has also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection this year, with health officials stating in May that there were no signs of transmission.\n\nHealth officials in the country have, however, found additional poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This news, released on June 5th, 2024, has shocked many, considering the outbreak occurred in March and the individual succumbed to the virus in April. The delay in reporting this case has raised concerns and questions about the transparency and efficiency of health communications in times of crisis.\n\nMexico Had A H5N2 Outbreak In March With One Death In April\n\nIt is also interesting to note that none of the stupid mainstream media in the West that covered this H5N2 News outbreak after WHO's released their report the last 36 hours questioned as to why the world is only knowing about this H5N2 outbreak that started since March 2024!\n\nThe Outbreak and Its Aftermath\n\nThe outbreak of H5N2 bird flu was first detected in a poultry farm in Michoacan state, Mexico, in March 2024. Despite the outbreak being reported promptly to the local authorities, it was not considered a threat to human health or distant commercial farms at that time. However, the situation took a drastic turn when a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico contracted the virus and subsequently died.\n\nThe Victim's Health and Hospitalization\n\nThe deceased, who had multiple underlying health conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing symptoms of bird flu. In mid-April, the patient experienced fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort. Despite receiving medical attention and being hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, the individual passed away on April 24th.\n\nUnknown Source of Infection\n\nOne of the most alarming aspects of this case is the unknown source of the infection. The victim had no known exposure to poultry or other animals, which makes the origin of the virus particularly concerning.\n\nWHO's statement highlighted that although H5N2 viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico, the specific route of transmission in this case remains a mystery.\n\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON520\n\nThis raises significant questions about how the virus could have infected a human without direct contact with infected birds.\n\nThe Global Context: H5N2 and H5N1\n\nWhile Mexico grapples with this H5N2 case, it's worth noting the broader context of bird flu globally. The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been causing outbreaks in the United States, particularly affecting dairy farm workers. Since March 2024, three cases of H5N1 human infection have been reported in the U.S., with symptoms ranging from conjunctiviti s to respiratory issues. Although the H5N2 strain in Mexico and the H5N1 strain in the U.S. are different, both highlight the persistent threat of avian influenza viruses crossing species barriers and infecting humans.\n\nMonitoring and Vigilance\n\nScientists have long warned about the potential for bird flu viruses to mutate and spread more easily among humans. Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, emphasized the need for vigilance, stating that H5 viruses have shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus since 1997. Every spillover event, he noted, is an opportunity for the virus to adapt and potentially become more transmissible among humans.\n\nThe Response and Future Precautions\n\nFollowing the death in Mexico, it was claimed that the Health Ministry and WHO took immediate steps to monitor and contain the situation. Farms near the victim's home were monitored, and individuals who had been in contact with the deceased were tested for bird flu, with all results returning negative. Despite these measures, the case underscores the importance of robust surveillance systems and rapid response mechanisms to detect and contain new infections promptly.\n\nGlobal Implications\n\nThe first human case of H5N2 bird flu in Mexico is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges posed by zoonotic diseases - those that can jump from animals to humans. Bird flu viruses typically circulate in birds but can occasionally infect humans through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. These infections can lead to a range of symptoms from mild respiratory issues to severe, potentially fatal illnesses.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nThe revelation of this H5N2 case months after the initial outbreak highlights a critical need for timely and transparent communication from health authorities. As the world continues to battle various strains of bird flu and other zoonotic diseases, global health agencies must prioritize swift reporting and effective containment strategies to mitigate the risks posed by these viruses. The case in Mexico serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of vigilance, preparedness, and international cooperation in managing public health threats.\n\nFor the latest H5N2 News, keep on logging to Thailand Medical News.\n\nRead Also:\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-gut-molecule-indole-3-propionic-acid-ipa-shows-promise-in-fighting-all-types-of-influenzas\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/south-korean-study-highlights-sting-agonists-as-potential-game-changers-in-combating-influenza-viruses\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-h5n1-genotype-affecting-cows-in-america-possibly-gains-entry-into-humans-via-the-eyes-thru-the-new-pb2-e67k-mutation", "source": {"uri": "thailandmedical.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Home -

Despite no direct poultry contact, underlying conditions contributed to the fatality. With low general risk, no further cases were found. Other strains like H5N1 have also surfaced elsewhere, heightening vigilance.\n\n(Adds detail, background throughout) June 5 (Reuters) -\n\nThe World Health Organization on Wednesday said a person's death was caused by the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with the A(H5N2) subtype of bird flu reported globally, and the first human infection with the H5 strain of the virus reported in Mexico. The 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico, who had been hospitalized in Mexico City, died on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general discomfort, WHO said.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" WHO said in a statement. The victim had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, but had multiple underlying medical conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms, the United Nations agency said.\n\nIn March, Mexico's government reported an outbreak of A(H5N2) in an isolated family unit in the country's western Michoacan state, but said at the time this did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health. After the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said.\n\nBased on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. No further cases have been reported during an investigation that tested people who had come into contact with the victim for types of influenza, as well as for COVID-19, it said.\n\nCases of bird flu have now been identified in mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists are on alert for changes in the virus that could signal it is adapting to spread more easily among humans.\n\nThe United States has reported three cases of human infection after exposure to cows since an outbreak was detected in dairy cattle in March. Two just had symptoms of conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms. Australia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

The case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms,\" WHO has said in a press release.\n\nNow, with the first human death of bird flu a big and threatening question arises: Can bird flu virus be passed on from one infected human to another?\n\n\"No evidence, so far\"\n\nThere has so far been no evidence of person-to-person transmission of bird flu in the case of a man who died from the disease in Mexico, the nation's health ministry said on Wednesday. The man had several prior health conditions, the ministry said in a statement, and all people who had contact with him have tested negative.\n\nThe WHO's press release says, 17 contacts of the deceased person were identified and monitored at the hospital out of which one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2, the WHO has said. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) which were identified near the case's residence were also found to be negative for flu.\n\nThe Mexico health ministry has confirmed that bird flu detected does not represent risk to the population. It also says that the source of infection in this case has not been identified.\n\nH5N2 bird flu\n\nIn March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which borders the State of Mexico where the case was residing, the WHO has said.\n\nH5N2 is a subtype of the avian influenza virus, primarily affecting birds, including domestic poultry and wild waterfowl. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it can cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected bird populations. While H5N2 primarily poses a threat to the poultry industry, causing significant economic losses, it has a low risk of transmission to humans. Effective biosecurity practices and surveillance are essential in managing H5N2 outbreaks.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters, AP)", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Health_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Health Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pan American Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac\u00e1n", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michoac\u00e1n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michoac\u00e1n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110766227,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-930240,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "dateEnd": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1281, "textEnd": 1296}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "dateEnd": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 1349, "textEnd": 1362}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

H5N2 is not the same strain that has infected multiple dairy cow herds in the U.S. That strain is called H5N1 and three farmworkers have gotten mild infections.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMexican health officials alerted the WHO that a 59-year-old man who died in a Mexico City hospital had the virus despite no known exposure to poultry or other animals.\n\nAccording to family members, the WHO release said, the patient had been bedridden for unrelated reasons before developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea on April 17. Mexico's public health department said in a statement that he had underlying ailments, including chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nHospital care was sought on April 24 and the man died the same day.\n\nInitial tests showed an unidentified type of flu that subsequent weeks of lab testing confirmed was H5N2.\n\nThe WHO said the risk to people in Mexico is low, and that no further human cases have been discovered so far despite testing people who came in contact with the deceased at home and in the hospital.\n\nThere had been three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in nearby parts of Mexico in March but authorities haven't been able to find a connection. Mexican officials also are monitoring birds near a shallow lake on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\nWhenever bird flu circulates in poultry, there is a risk that people in close contact with flocks can become infected. Health authorities are closely watching for any signs that the viruses are evolving to spread easily from person to person, and experts are concerned as more mammal species contract bird flu viruses.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the disease has also been found in other animals, such as pigs and dogs in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, as well as domestic cats in Germany.\n\nIt spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure, and it can prove deadly in domestic poultry.\n\nWhile it is unclear how the Mexico resident became infected, multiple cases of avian influenza have been reported in the country in recent months, including one outbreak detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n in March.\n\nAnother outbreak was identified in March in poultry in Texcoco, in the State of Mexico, and another in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state, the health body said.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" the WHO said Wednesday.\n\nThe latest discovery marks the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico, according to the UN body.\n\nNo further cases of the virus were reported during an epidemiological investigation into the latest case. Seventeen people who were at the hospital where the man died were monitored, with health officials only reporting a runny nose in one of them between April 28-29.\n\nBird Flu Outbreak Reported Among American Farmers\n\nNone of those individuals tested positive for influenza or SARS-CoV 2, the healthy body noted.\n\nAdditionally, 12 other people were identified as having been \"near\" the man's home before his hospitalization and death, according to the WHO.\n\nSeven of those people were symptomatic and five asymptomatic, however, all of those individuals subsequently tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B.\n\nDespite the man's death, the UN agency said Wednesday that -- based on available information -- the current risk to the general population posed by this virus is low.\n\nThe WHO also said the case is unrelated to a different outbreak of bird flu, H5N1, that has been detected in the United States, although both are H5 avian viruses.\n\nThat outbreak has so far infected three individuals; all of whom were dairy farm workers.\n\nAlong with the United States and Mexico, Australia has also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection this year, with health officials stating in May that there were no signs of transmission.\n\nHealth officials in the country have, however, found additional poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

All people who had contact with him have tested negative, it said.\n\nIn March, Mexico's government reported an outbreak of A(H5N2) in an isolated family unit in the country's western Michoacan state, but said at the time it did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health.\n\nAfter the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said.\n\nThere had been three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in nearby parts of Mexico in March, but authorities haven't been able to find a connection.\n\nScientists said the case in Mexico is unrelated to the outbreak of a different strain of bird flu - H5N1 - in the United States that has so far infected three dairy farm workers.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,\" he said.\n\nCases of bird flu have now been identified in mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in the state of Victoria.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [],

Health authorities are closely watching for any signs that the viruses are evolving to spread easily from person to person, and experts are concerned as more mammal species contract bird flu viruses.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

This first human fatality from bird flu raises a critical question: Can the virus be transmitted from one infected person to another?\n\n\"On 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals.The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms,\" WHO has said in a press release.\n\nAs of now, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the case of the man who died in Mexico, according to the nation's health ministry. The man had multiple pre-existing health conditions, and all individuals who had contact with him tested negative for the virus, the ministry stated.\n\nAccording to the WHO, 17 people who had contact with the deceased were identified and monitored in the hospital. Among them, one person reported a runny nose between April 28 and 29. However, samples taken from these hospital contacts between May 27 and 29 tested negative for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 12 more contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) near the man's residence also tested negative for the flu.\n\nThe Mexican health ministry has confirmed that the detected bird flu does not pose a risk to the general population. The source of the infection in this case remains unidentified.\n\nIn March 2024, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected at a backyard poultry farm in Michoac\u00e1n, a state bordering the State of Mexico where the deceased man lived, according to the WHO.\n\nH5N2 is a subtype of the avian influenza virus, primarily affecting birds, including domestic poultry and wild waterfowl. It is highly pathogenic, causing severe illness and high mortality rates in bird populations. Although H5N2 poses a significant threat to the poultry industry, leading to substantial economic losses, it has a low risk of transmission to humans.

The virus does not often spread to humans but sporadic infections have been reported. There are several strains all belonging to influenza A-type viruses.\n\nThe most common subtypes that may affect humans are A (H5N1), A (H7N9) and A (H9N2), according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIn humans, symptoms can resemble a typical flu but may advance into more serious respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn birds, avian flu is highly contagious and cases can range in severity from mild to highly deadly. Infected birds shed the viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces, meaning other birds can contract the virus through contact with those fluids directly or via contact with a contaminated surface.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H9N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H9N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/05/USAT/73991719007-getty-images-1581546220.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 24, "textEnd": 32}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

These include in a backyard chicken farm in Michoacan state, which borders Mexico State, where the man lived, but authorities have so far been unable to establish a connection.\n\nThe WHO said no further human cases have been discovered despite testing people who came in contact with the deceased at home and in hospital.\n\n\"Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low,\" it said.\n\nMexico's Ministry of Health also said there was \"no risk of contagion for the population,\" noting that \"all samples from identified contacts [of the patient] have been negative\".\n\nAuthorities are monitoring farms near the victim's home and have established a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area, the ministry added.\n\nA different variant of bird flu, A(H5N1), has been spreading for weeks among dairy cow herds in the US, with a small number of cases reported among humans.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of A(H5N6) in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,\" Pekosz said.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

flu.\n\nThe patient, who died on April 24 after developing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea and nausea, had \"no history of exposure to poultry or other animals\" and \"multiple underlying medical conditions\", the WHO said.\n\nMexican health authorities reported the confirmed case of human infection with the virus to the UN health body on May 23, after a 59-year-old was taken to hospital in Mexico City.\n\nThe WHO said the case was the \"first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally\".\n\nThe source of exposure to the virus was unknown, the WHO said, although cases of H5N2 have been reported in poultry in the country.\n\nAccording to the UN health body, H5N2 cases affected poultry in the state of Michoacan in March, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico.\n\nBut it said establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections was so far impossible, estimating the risk to people as \"low\".\n\nA different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading for weeks among dairy cow herds in the United States, with a small number of cases reported among humans.\n\nBut none of the cases are human-to-human infections, with the disease instead jumping from cattle to people, authorities have said.", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"},

H5N2 is not the same strain that has infected multiple dairy cow herds in the U.S. That strain is called H5N1 and three farmworkers have gotten mild infections.\n\nBefore the H5N2 case was confirmed, it was unclear whether it could infect humans.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere had been three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in nearby parts of Mexico in March, but authorities were unable to find a connection. Mexican officials also are monitoring birds near a shallow lake on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\nWhenever bird flu circulates in poultry, there is a risk that people in close contact with flocks can become infected. Health authorities are closely watching for any signs that the viruses are evolving to spread easily from person to person, and experts are concerned as more mammal species contract bird flu viruses.\n\nMexican health officials alerted the WHO that a 59-year-old man who died in a Mexico City hospital had the virus despite no known exposure to poultry or other animals.\n\nAccording to family members, the WHO release said, the patient had been bedridden for unrelated reasons before developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhoea on April 17.\n\nMexico's public health department said in a statement that he had underlying ailments, including chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nHospital care was sought on April 24 and the man died the same day.\n\nInitial tests showed an unidentified type of flu that subsequent weeks of lab testing confirmed was H5N2.\n\nThe WHO said the risk to people in Mexico is low, and that no further human cases have been discovered so far despite testing people who came in contact with the deceased at home and in the hospital.\n\nThe WHO say they have not changed their public health advice following news of the outbreak, and encourage people to take the same precautions as normal to avoid influenza.\n\nIn a statement, the organisation said: 'Based on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.\n\n'If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information, including information on A(H5N2) viruses detected in local animal populations, become available.'\n\nElsewhere in their assessment, the organisation urged local health services to be vigilant of any potential outbreaks and to report them to the WHO at the earliest opportunity.\n\nTravellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza such as Mexico should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that may have been contaminated with animal faeces, WHO reports.\n\nAnyone travelling to Mexico should also wash their hands often with soap and water, they added.\n\nIn their report, WHO advised: 'Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\n'Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this occurs, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\n'WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions regarding the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.'\n\nAccording to the NHS, the main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include:\n\nOther early symptoms may include: diarrhoea, sickness, stomach pain, chest pain, bleeding from the nose and gums and conjunctivitis.\n\nIt usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you've been infected.\n\nWithin days of symptoms appearing, it's possible to develop more severe complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine for bird flu, the NHS added, although the WHO is reportedly working on one in the event of a pandemic-level threat.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The government said the cases did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health.\n\nAfter the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said.\n\nMexico's Health Ministry said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the case and farms near the victim's home were monitored.\n\nOther people in contact with the person tested negative for bird flu, the health ministry and the WHO said.\n\nBird flu has infected mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nScientists are on alert for changes in the virus that could signal it is adapting to spread more easily among humans.\n\nThe United States has reported three cases of H5N1 human infection after exposure to cows since an outbreak was detected in dairy cattle in March.

The source of the man's infection remains unclear, although H5N2 has been detected in poultry in Mexico.\n\nH5N2 differs from H5N1, the strain that has affected multiple dairy cow herds in the US, resulting in mild infections in three farmworkers. Various bird flu strains have previously caused human fatalities worldwide, including 18 deaths in China from H5N6 during a 2021 outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMexican health officials informed the WHO that the deceased man, who had no known exposure to poultry or other animals, passed away in a Mexico City hospital. The man, bedridden due to unrelated health issues, developed a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhoea on April 17. He sought hospital care on April 24 and died the same day. Initial tests indicated an unidentified flu type, which was later confirmed as H5N2 after several weeks of lab testing.\n\nThe WHO stated that the risk to the public in Mexico is low, with no further human cases detected among those who had contact with the deceased. Three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 were reported in nearby regions of Mexico in March, but no direct link to the man's infection has been established. Authorities are also monitoring birds near a shallow lake on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\nWhenever bird flu circulates in poultry, there is a risk of human infection for those in close contact with the flocks.

H5N2 is not the same strain that has infected multiple dairy cow herds in the U.S. That strain is called H5N1 and three farmworkers have gotten mild infections.\n\nOther bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMexican health officials alerted the WHO that a 59-year-old man who died in a Mexico City hospital had the virus despite no known exposure to poultry or other animals.\n\nAccording to family members, the WHO release said, the patient had been bedridden for unrelated reasons before developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea on April 17. Mexico's public health department said in a statement that he had underlying ailments, including chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nHospital care was sought on April 24 and the man died the same day.\n\nInitial tests showed an unidentified type of flu that subsequent weeks of lab testing confirmed was H5N2.\n\nThe WHO said the risk to people in Mexico is low, and that no further human cases have been discovered so far despite testing people who came in contact with the deceased at home and in the hospital.\n\nThere had been three poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in nearby parts of Mexico in March but authorities haven't been able to find a connection. Mexican officials also are monitoring birds near a shallow lake on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\nWhenever bird flu circulates in poultry, there is a risk that people in close contact with flocks can become infected. Health authorities are closely watching for any signs that the viruses are evolving to spread easily from person to person, and experts are concerned as more mammal species contract bird flu viruses.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\nOn 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\n\nOn 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition.\n\nResults from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). On 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2).\n\nNo further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case's residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient's residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. The results of the serological samples are pending.\n\nIn March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which borders the State of Mexico where the case was residing\n\nAdditionally, in March 2024, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) was identified in poultry in Texcoco, State of Mexico, and a second outbreak of LPAI A(H5N2) in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state. Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks (1).\n\nA study describing the continuous circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 viruses in Mexico and spread to several other countries was published in 2022 (2).", "source": {"uri": "who.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "who.int"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The victim, a 59-year-old man from Mexico, succumbed to avian influenza A (H5N2). The man died on April 24 after experiencing symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea, and general malaise, Mexican health authorities said. This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of H5N2 globally and the first avian (bird) H5 virus infection reported in Mexico.\n\nThe victim reportedly had no prior contact with poultry or other animals, raising concerns about how the virus was contracted. He had been bedridden for three weeks before succumbing to severe symptoms of bird flu. It is believed that pre-existing conditions may have worsened his health, contributing to his death.\n\nThe specific strain and its impact on humans are still being investigated. The WHO was alerted about the case on May 23, prompting global health authorities to monitor the situation closely. \"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" WHO said in a statement.\n\nExperts note that the H5N2 strain responsible for this death is different from the H5N1 strain currently affecting livestock in the US. In March, H5N1 was detected in US dairy herds, with cases confirmed in three dairy workers. Surveillance and preventive measures are being intensified to control the spread of the virus.\n\nALSO READ: Sunita Williams, Indian-Origin Astronaut, Flies To Space Onboard Boeing Starliner", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/06/06/article/image/birdflu-1717660833018.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 224}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 926, "textEnd": 932}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The source of exposure to the virus remains unknown. The deceased, a resident of the State of Mexico, had been hospitalised in Mexico City and died on April 24 after suffering from fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort. The individual had chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, which heightened the risk of severe influenza, as quoted by news agency Reuters.\n\nWHO noted that while the source of this specific infection is unclear, A(H5N2) viruses have been detected in poultry in Mexico. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus worldwide and the first avian H5 virus infection reported in Mexico.\n\nThe WHO assessed the current risk of bird flu to the general population as low. Mexico's Health Ministry confirmed that there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission and that farms near the victim's residence have been monitored. Individuals in contact with the patient tested negative for bird flu.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, emphasised the need for vigilance in monitoring such infections due to the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans. Scientists remain alert to changes in the virus that could enhance its transmissibility among humans, as quoted by Reuters.\n\nWhile the strain in Mexico differs from the H5N1 strain affecting dairy cattle in the United States, both are H5 avian viruses. The U.S. has reported three human H5N1 infections among dairy farm workers. Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) in May, alongside poultry cases of H7 bird flu in Victoria state.\n\nThe death in Mexico highlighted the ongoing need for rigorous monitoring and research to prevent potential human outbreaks of avian influenza.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nitin_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Nitin Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/06/mixcollage-06-jun-2024-06-40-am-2042-1717636757.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 342, "textEnd": 350}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The government said the cases did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health.\n\nAfter the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said.\n\nMexico's Health Ministry said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the case and farms near the victim's home were monitored.\n\nOther people in contact with the person tested negative for bird flu, the health ministry and the WHO said.\n\nBird flu has infected mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nScientists are on alert for changes in the virus that could signal it is adapting to spread more easily among humans.\n\nThe United States has reported three cases of H5N1 human infection after exposure to cows since an outbreak was detected in dairy cattle in March. Two had symptoms of conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms.\n\nAlthough the death in Mexico was not the same strain as the one that is currently infecting cattle in the United States, they are both H5 avian viruses.\n\nPekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,\" Pekosz said.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.\n\n(Reporting by Urvi Dugar and Puyaan Singh in Bengaluru, Ana Isabel Martinez and Sarah Morland in Mexico City; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Richard Chang, Bill Berkrot and Lisa Shumaker)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.\n\nThe WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day.This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.\n\nIn March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as \"low.\"\n\nThe Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, \"How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.\"\n\nThe WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.\n\nIn the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.\n\nAustralia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.\n\nPekosz added, \"Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus.

About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to be infected have died.

The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained human-to-human spread.\n\nThe person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness. On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day.\n\nOn May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was subsequently confirmed by a different lab.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOf 17 people at the hospital who'd been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve additional contacts were identified near the person's residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of samples from these cases didn't identify Covid-19 or any type of flu. Scientists are now testing blood samples to see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections.\n\nIn March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the person lived. According to WHO, it hasn't been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nFlu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans. People catch the viruses from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.\n\nDepending on the original host, type A flu strains can be classified as bird flu, swine flu or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nBird flu infections in humans can cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Eye infections like conjunctivitis, gut symptoms and brain swelling are also possible.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brenda_goodman@cnn.com", "name": "Brenda Goodman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Gupta"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cranberries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cranberries", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-06-05t231830z-2103007155-rc2258azl424-rtrmadp-3-health-birdflu-mexico.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1448, "textEnd": 1456}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1623, "textEnd": 1628}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The man died one week after developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea. It's the first lab-confirmed case of a person contracting a form of bird flu known as H5N2, the WHO said in a statement, raising questions about a strain that has largely been under the radar. The current bird flu outbreak in US dairy cows is being driven by a different strain -- H5N1.\n\nThe patient, who lived in central Mexico, had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The Mexican government doesn't know where he was exposed to the virus, though the strain of avian influenza has been reported in poultry in the Mexican state where the person lived.\n\nThe current risk posed by the H5N2 virus to the general public is low, according to the WHO, which said no further cases were reported after an investigation.\n\nThe H5N2-infected man had several underlying health conditions, including chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and longstanding hypertension, according to Mexico's health ministry Wednesday. He had been bedridden for three weeks prior to the onset of acute symptoms in mid-April, the WHO added, citing the patient's relatives. Though hospitalized on April 24, the man died the same day.\n\nMexican authorities reported the fatal case to the WHO on May 23 after confirming the presence of the virus in a sample from the deceased man.\n\nWhile the man in Central Mexico marks the first laboratory-confirmed case of H5N2 in humans, researchers have identified people with antibodies that could signal prior infections.\n\nKatrine Wallace, an epidemiologist with the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health, said that H5N2 poses a low risk to public health because it hasn't shown an ability to be transmitted between humans. To that end, it's concerning that the patient isn't known to have had exposure to animals which are the most likely source of disease, she added.\n\nWallace said more surveillance is needed to fill in the gaps of information.\n\n\"It's so crazy that we don't know where this is coming from,\" she said.\n\nThe Mexican government has begun monitoring wild birds for H5N2 in the wetlands of Tlahuac in Mexico City, as well as farms, backyards and other areas near where the man resided. So far, no infected birds have been identified, the health ministry said in Wednesday's statement.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the US, the H5N1 outbreak in cattle continues to expand its geographic reach. On Wednesday, Iowa announced it had identified infected cows, bringing the total number of states that have detected bird flu in herds to 10. So far this year, three US-based farmworkers have tested positive for bird flu -- one in Texas and two in Michigan. They had symptoms of eye irritation and one had a cough.

However, the government of Mexico stated at the time that the outbreak did not pose a threat to the health of humans or to commercial farms that were located further away.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mexican authorities confirmed the existence of the virus after the death that occurred in April and reported the case to the WHO.\n\nIn the month of March, there were three outbreaks of H5N2 in poultry in neighboring regions of Mexico; however, the authorities have not been able to establish a relationship between the outbreaks.\n\nWhich has so far infected three dairy farm workers, is not related to the case that occurred in Mexico, according to the scientists who investigated the matter.\n\nAccording to a chronology of bird flu outbreaks provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, several strains of the bird flu have been responsible for the deaths of people all over the world in the years prior to 2021. That timeline includes the deaths of 18 individuals in China during an outbreak of H5N6.\n\nAn influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University named Andrew Pekosz stated that since 1997, H5 viruses have consistently demonstrated a tendency to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. This preference has been observed consistently.\n\nHe stated that \"so it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections.\" This is due to the fact that every spillover is an opportunity for the virus to try to acquire those changes that make it better able to infect humans.\n\nMammals such as seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle have now been shown to have contracted bird flu. This is mostly owing to the fact that these animals came into touch with diseased birds.", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salman_ahmad@chiangraitimes.com", "name": "Salman Ahmad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac\u00e1n", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michoac\u00e1n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michoac\u00e1n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raccoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bird-Flu.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 944, "textEnd": 954}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

On April 17, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise.\"\n\nA week later, the case went to seek \"medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition.\"\n\n\"Results from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on April 24 indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus,\" the WHO confirmed.\n\n\"On May 8, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2),\" it noted. \"On May 20, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A.\"\n\nNo other cases were reported during the investigation.\n\nAdditionally, out of the 17 contacts identified and observed at the hospital where the patient died, one reported having a runny nose between April 28 and April 29.\n\nThe samples from these hospital contacts between May 27 and May 29 tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2.\n\nTwelve more contacts, seven who were symptomatic and five who had been asymptomatic, had been identified near the patient's home.\n\n\"Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals,\" the WHO stated.\n\n\"On May 28, the InDRE reported that all 12 samples from contacts near the patient's residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR,\" they mentioned. \"The results of the serological samples are pending.\"\n\nScientists are monitoring changes in the virus, which could signal that bird flu is adapting to circulate more easily among humans.\n\nIn early May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the H5N1 bird flu had spread to 36 dairy cow herds across nine states since April 30.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) took measures to address the situation, including collecting ground beef samples from retail stores in states impacted by the bird flu outbreaks.\n\nThe samples would be tested to confirm the presence of any viral particles. Previous studies found these particles in cow's milk samples, with as many as 1 in 5 samples having tested positive.\n\nAs a part of containment efforts, the USDA mandated that dairy cows test negative for bird flu before they are transported across state lines. This choice came after criticism from infectious disease experts who claimed that poor testing inhibited an accurate assessment of the outbreak's scale.\n\nIn late May, Australia confirmed its first human case of bird flu and a different outbreak of the H5N1 strain on a poultry farm in the state of Victoria.\n\nThe infected patient was a child who contracted the strain while they traveled in India.\n\nAuthorities in Victoria revealed that the child endured a severe infection but has since then made a complete recovery.\n\nNotably, contact tracing efforts did not identify any other cases related to this incident, and health officials highlighted the minimal risk of the virus circulating quickly between people.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Bird Flu H5N2 Health News

On Wednesday, Mexican health officials and the World Health Organization announced a confirmed case of H5N2 avian influenza in a 59-year-old man, who subsequently died from complications of the infection. The incident is the first lab-confirmed case and death tied to H5N2, but WHO officials say that the risk to the general public from this virus is low.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the man first developed symptoms of the infection on April 17, which included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort. On April 24, after seeking medical attention, the man was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, but he succumbed to his illness and died that same day.\n\nDoctors detected an unknown subtype of influenza A virus within the man's respiratory samples, which prompted genetic sequencing. The early results suggested that this virus was a strain of H5N2, which was subsequently confirmed by further testing. On May 24, local health officials notified the WHO of their discovery.\n\nThe case doesn't appear to be connected to the ongoing outbreaks of bird flu in U.S. dairy cattle, which are caused by strains of H5N1 avian influenza. But there have been recent outbreaks of both low and high pathogenic H5N2 bird flu strains among poultry farms in Mexico (pathogenic referring to its ability to cause illness and death in birds). At least three such outbreaks of H5N2 occurred near or in the state of Mexico, where the man resided, in March 2024. At this point, however, it's not known whether this case is connected to any of these clusters, since the man had no reported history of exposure to poultry or other animals. This is the first confirmed human case and death ever linked to H5N2.\n\nBird flu is worrying for several reasons. For one, humans already have low immunity to these strains relative to the seasonal flu strains that circulate every year. Given enough bad luck, the fear is that some strains will develop the right assortment of mutations that would allow the virus to spread easily between humans and cause substantial amounts of severe illness at the same time -- the beginnings of a potential pandemic.\n\nAs of yet, neither avian H5N1 nor H5N2 appear certain to make this jump to people. Health officials identified and monitored 17 recent contacts of the 59-year-old man, including people at the hospital where he died. While some people did experience symptoms of a potential respiratory illness, none of the contacts have tested positive for an acute infection of H5N2, though antibody tests that can detect a past infection are still pending. It's also possible that the man's preexisting health may have played a role in the severity of his illness, since the man had several underlying conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks prior to his symptoms, according to interviews with his relatives.\n\nFor now, the WHO's assessment of the threat posed by H5N2 and other bird flu strains remains the same: a serious concern that has to be monitored closely and contained as much as possible, but not an imminent danger.\n\n\"Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses from previous events have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans, thus the current likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low,\" the WHO wrote in its report of the H5N2 case.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/8f8b683a02e93f29ad1c124d06a95166.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 494, "textEnd": 502}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 592, "textEnd": 600}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1035, "textEnd": 1041}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

These avian viruses have long been thought to pose the greatest risk of another human pandemic.\n\nStrains like H5N1 have shown a worrying ability to infect mammals and humans. It has killed around 400 people since its discovery in the late 1990s, while another clade - H5N6 - caused 18 deaths in China in 2021.\n\nExperts are racing to understand whether the H5N2 case was an isolated incident, or if it somehow links to the ongoing H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US - which has so far infected 82 herds of dairy cattle in ten states, and at least three farm workers.\n\n\"This could be a fully avian H5N2 strain from poultry in Mexico, but we won't know until we get genomic sequence data, which has not yet been released,\" said Dr Rick Bright, a former head of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\n\"This case raises many more questions that we haven't come close to answering about the virus on our doorstep,\" he added.\n\n\"Mexico and the US are very closely linked, if both of these viruses - H5N2 and H5N1 - are in the environment and circulating around us, the risk for a more significant outbreak increases greatly,\" Dr Bright said.\n\n'Could a mouse be a mixing vessel?'\n\nOne theory is that the H5N2 virus has somehow mixed with the H5N1 virus circulating in the US.\n\nJust this week, the US Department of Agriculture released data showing that eleven house mice in the state of New Mexico - around 2,000km away from Mexico City - had contracted H5N1.\n\nAlthough not the most likely scenario, it's not out of the question that mammals like rodents could have somehow facilitated the transmission or reassortment of these viruses, potentially creating new and more dangerous strains.\n\n\"This needs to be ruled out quickly and clearly - if a reassortment has happened, we'll need to pick up the response. Could a mouse be a mixing vessel?\" said Dr Bright.\n\nAnother theory is that the victim might have had contact with people in the US working closely with sick cattle. About half of all US dairy workers - 51 per cent - are undocumented migrants, a significant proportion of which are Mexican.\n\n\"It's unclear if any of his contacts or visitors had any travel to the US, or if any of the migrant workers from the US were someone in contact with him,\" Dr Bright said.\n\nAgain, although H5N2 is a different strain of bird flu from H5N1, scientists have not yet seen genomic data - meaning they are ruling nothing out for the time being.\n\nTwelve of the patient's contacts have been tested for the virus, and have come back negative, Mexican health authorities said. The WHO also stressed that the risk of human-human transmission is very low.\n\n\"Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low,\" the report read.\n\nThe results from serological samples, which would detect a prior infection, have not been released yet, however. If a contact had the virus unknowingly, this might raise the risk that H5N2 has spread further into the local population.\n\nSwine flu, also known as H1N1, began in Mexico in 2009 and escalated into a pandemic. Originating from pigs, it swiftly spread among humans.\n\nSpillover events are thought to be more likely in developing nations like Mexico and parts of Asia because people live in far closer proximity to animals - chicken dashing around a backyard, meat purchased from a live market, etc.\n\nWith this new development, concerns about controlling the bird flu virus and preventing it from spreading from poultry to humans have been raised by experts.\n\n\"Rapid home and community-based tests need to be made available,\" Dr Bright said. \"Vaccine composition needs to be urgently reassessed as well.\"\n\nCurrently, there are no specific vaccines for preventing an H5N2 virus in humans.\n\nThe US government is poised to announce a multimillion-dollar investment in mRNA vaccines with Moderna for H5N1 bird flu as early as next month, but this would likely not be effective for the H5N2 strain.\n\nFinland became the first country to announce plans to provide bird flu vaccines to individuals at risk of contracting H5N1 this week.\n\nThe vaccination effort will target specific groups, including poultry farmers, veterinarians, researchers specialising in the virus, and workers in fur farms where animals such as mink and foxes are housed, and where outbreaks have occurred.\n\nFinnish health authorities have thus far ordered 20,000 doses which will be administered as soon as they arrive, Stat magazine reported.\n\nScientists have welcomed the news, and have questioned why countries including the US have not followed suit.\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about

According to scientists, the instance had nothing to do with the H5N1 avian flu outbreak that has sickened three dairy farm workers in the US thus far.\n\nAdditionally, the Health Ministry of Mexico stated in a statement that the infection's source was unknown. According to the WHO, the victim had numerous underlying medical issues and had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before the onset of severe symptoms. She had no history of exposure to chickens or other animals.\n\nThe individual had type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, according to Mexico's health ministry. According to Johns Hopkins University influenza specialist Andrew Pekosz, \"that immediately puts a person at risk of more severe influenza, even with seasonal flu\".\n\nHowever, there remains \"a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly\" regarding how this person became infected.\n\nMexico's authorities said in March that there had been an A(H5N2) outbreak in a solitary family in the western state of Michoacan. According to the authorities, there is no risk to human health or remote commercial farms from these incidents.\n\nThe WHO added that Mexican officials reported the case to them and verified the virus's existence following the death in April. According to Mexico's Health Ministry, farms close to the victim's residence were observed, but there was no indication of a person-to-person transfer in this instance.\n\nThe WHO and the health ministry said that no one else who had contact with the affected individual tested positive for bird flu. Mammals include seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle have contracted bird flu, mostly as a result of coming into touch with diseased birds.\n\nResearchers are watching for any alterations in the virus that would indicate it is changing to become more easily transmitted among people.\n\nSince an outbreak of H5N1 was discovered in dairy cattle in March, three instances of the virus in humans have been recorded from contact to cows in the United States. Three also had respiratory problems, and two had conjunctivitis symptoms.\n\nThey are both H5 avian viruses, even though the type that killed the person in Mexico was different from the one that is presently infecting cattle in the US.\n\nMore than any other avian influenza virus, according to Pekosz, H5 viruses have consistently demonstrated a tendency to infect mammals since 1997.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans\" , Pekosz stated.\n\nIn May, Australia declared the first-ever instance of A(H5N1) infection in a human, adding that no evidence of transmission was present. However, it has discovered more H7 bird flu cases in poultry on Victorian farms.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 25}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/87011f76e9c52e8506c9364c602e3560_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 397}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The man died one week after developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea. It's the first lab-confirmed case of a person contracting a form of bird flu known as H5N2, the WHO said in a statement, raising questions about a strain that has largely been under the radar. The current bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows is being driven by a different strain - H5N1.\n\nThe patient, who lived in central Mexico, had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The Mexican government doesn't know where he was exposed to the virus, though the strain of avian influenza has been reported in poultry in the Mexican state where the person lived.\n\nThe current risk posed by the H5N2 virus to the general public is low, according to the WHO, which said no further cases were reported after an investigation.\n\nThe H5N2-infected man had several underlying health conditions, including chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and longstanding hypertension, according to Mexico's health ministry Wednesday. He had been bedridden for three weeks prior to the onset of acute symptoms in mid-April, the WHO added, citing the patient's relatives. Though hospitalized on April 24, the man died the same day.\n\nMexican authorities reported the fatal case to the WHO on May 23 after confirming the presence of the virus in a sample from the deceased man.\n\nWhile the man in Central Mexico marks the first laboratory-confirmed case of H5N2 in humans, researchers have identified people with antibodies that could signal prior infections.\n\nKatrine Wallace, an epidemiologist with the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health, said that H5N2 poses a low risk to public health because it hasn't shown an ability to be transmitted between humans. To that end, it's concerning that the patient isn't known to have had exposure to animals, which are the most likely source of disease, she added.\n\nWallace said more surveillance is needed to fill in the gaps of information.\n\n\"It's so crazy that we don't know where this is coming from,\" she said.\n\nThe Mexican government has begun monitoring wild birds for H5N2 in the wetlands of Tlahuac in Mexico City, as well as farms, backyards and other areas near where the man resided. So far, no infected birds have been identified, the health ministry said in Wednesday's statement.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the U.S., the H5N1 outbreak in cattle continues to expand its geographic reach. On Wednesday, Iowa announced it had identified infected cows, bringing the total number of states that have detected bird flu in herds to 10. So far this year, three U.S.-based farmworkers have tested positive for bird flu - one in Texas and two in Michigan. They had symptoms of eye irritation and one had a cough. There have been no fatal human cases associated with the U.S. H5N1 outbreak.\n\n_____\n\n(With assistance from Madison Muller and Maya Averbuch.)\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com",

About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to be infected have died. On Wednesday, WHO said it had confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N2 in a 59-year-old resident of Mexico.\n\nThe source of the person's infection is unknown, although WHO noted that H5N2 viruses had been reported in poultry in Mexico.\n\nBecause any new influenza A infection in people has the potential for high public health impact, it must be reported to WHO. The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained human-to-human spread.\n\nThe person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness. On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day.\n\nOn May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was subsequently confirmed by a different lab.\n\nOf 17 people at the hospital who'd been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve additional contacts were identified near the person's residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of samples from these cases didn't identify Covid-19 or any type of flu. Scientists are now testing blood samples to see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections.\n\nIn March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the person lived. According to WHO, it hasn't been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nFlu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans.

It's unclear how the man was exposed to the virus, but this type of avian flu has previously been found in poultry in the country. The risk to the general public is still considered to be low.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed a report of a fatal human case of H5N2 influenza, filed by the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) on May 23, 2024. The 59-year-old man was a resident of the State of Mexico and had been treated in hospital in Mexico City after developing symptoms including fever, shortness of breath, and diarrhea.\n\nHe had been unwell previously and had multiple underlying conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, but had sought medical treatment for the new symptoms on April 24.\n\nPCR testing confirmed that he was suffering from influenza type A, but further testing by Mexican health authorities was required to confirm the subtype as H5N2.\n\nInfluenza subtypes are categorized according to two surface proteins that pepper the outside of each virus particle. There's hemagglutinin, responsible for the \"H\" number, and neuraminidase, which gives the \"N\" number. The swine flu pandemic of 2009 was caused by an H1N1 virus. Other rare subtypes circulate in pig or bird populations and very occasionally make the jump to humans.\n\nWe've heard a lot recently about outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu across the United States and around the world, with wild birds, dairy cows, cats, and alpacas being just some of the species affected. There have been three reported human cases of H5N1 directly linked to outbreaks on dairy farms, but all three patients have recovered.\n\nH5N2 - the virus that infected the man in Mexico - is also an avian flu virus and has the same hemagglutinin type as H5N1, but a different neuraminidase protein. These two proteins help the virus invade cells and are targeted by the immune system as it races to build an antibody response.\n\nThe WHO reports that no further cases have been detected so far. Seventeen of the man's close contacts were monitored in hospital, and all tested negative for the flu and COVID-19 between May 27 and 28. Additionally, 12 of the patient's neighbors have been tested, seven of whom have shown some symptoms. As of May 28, however, all 12 have tested negative for influenza A, influenza B, and COVID.\n\nThere have been three outbreaks of H5N2 strains on poultry farms in Mexico this year. \"Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks,\" the WHO explained.\n\nThe Mexican government also said in a statement that there was no risk to the wider population.\n\nWhile the H5N2 virus is not the same as the H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza that's currently hitting headlines, influenza expert Andrew Pekosz from Johns Hopkins University told Reuters that the case underscores the potential of H5 viruses to jump into other mammals.\n\n\"So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,\" Pekosz said.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com",

Credit - Bloomberg\n\nA man in Mexico died after contracting a strain of bird flu that hasn't been confirmed in humans before, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.\n\nThe virus was detected in a 59-year-old patient who had been hospitalized in Mexico City. The man died one week after developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea. It's the first lab-confirmed case of a person contracting a form of bird flu known as H5N2, the WHO said in a statement, raising questions about a strain that has largely been under the radar. The current bird flu outbreak in US dairy cows is being driven by a different strain -- H5N1.\n\nThe patient, who lived in central Mexico, had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The Mexican government doesn't know where he was exposed to the virus, though the strain of avian influenza has been reported in poultry in the Mexican state where the person lived.\n\nThe current risk posed by the H5N2 virus to the general public is low, according to the WHO, which said no further cases were reported after an investigation.\n\nThe H5N2-infected man had several underlying health conditions, including chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and longstanding hypertension, according to Mexico's health ministry Wednesday. He had been bedridden for three weeks prior to the onset of acute symptoms in mid-April, the WHO added, citing the patient's relatives. Though hospitalized on April 24, the man died the same day.\n\nMexican authorities reported the fatal case to the WHO on May 23 after confirming the presence of the virus in a sample from the deceased man.\n\nWhile the man in Central Mexico marks the first laboratory-confirmed case of H5N2 in humans, researchers have identified people with antibodies that could signal prior infections.\n\nKatrine Wallace, an epidemiologist with the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health, said that H5N2 poses a low risk to public health because it hasn't shown an ability to be transmitted between humans. To that end, it's concerning that the patient isn't known to have had exposure to animals which are the most likely source of disease, she added.\n\nWallace said more surveillance is needed to fill in the gaps of information.\n\n\"It's so crazy that we don't know where this is coming from,\" she said.\n\nThe Mexican government has begun monitoring wild birds for H5N2 in the wetlands of Tlahuac in Mexico City, as well as farms, backyards and other areas near where the man resided. So far, no infected birds have been identified, the health ministry said in Wednesday's statement.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the US, the H5N1 outbreak in cattle continues to expand its geographic reach. On Wednesday, Iowa announced it had identified infected cows, bringing the total number of states that have detected bird flu in herds to 10. So far this year, three US-based farmworkers have tested positive for bird flu -- one in Texas and two in Michigan. They had symptoms of eye irritation and one had a cough. There have been no fatal human cases associated with the US H5N1 outbreak.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The WHO said that, at this point, just how the person contracted the virus is unknown, although H5N2 is known to circulate in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThe person was already in a weakened state, bedridden for three weeks with other underlying medical conditions before developing symptoms of bird flu in mid-April. Those symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\n\nOn April 24, the person was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, but died of complications that day, the WHO said.\n\nDoctors sent a sample obtained from the patient which was confirmed to be positive for H5N2 by two separate labs.\n\nThe virus does not seem to be easily transmitted: Of 17 people who'd had contact with the patient in the hospital, none have become infected.\n\nTwelve more people living near the patient's home were also tested, seven of who had symptoms, but none tested positive for COVID-19 or any kind of flu. Ongoing blood testing is being conducted to see if any antibodies point to past infections.\n\nThe WHO noted that in March, an outbreak of H5N2 had been identified at a poultry farm in a neighboring region, although its unclear if that outbreak has any connection to the patient's case.\n\nBird flu has been known to be transmitted to humans from infected animals, and an ongoing outbreak of H5N1 virus in U.S. dairy cows has resulted in three known human cases, all in dairy workers who experienced relatively mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about avian flu at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSOURCE: World Health Organization, Disease Outbreak News, June 5, 2024\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nDoctors in Mexico have identified the first known case in a human of H5N2 bird flu, a different strain from H5N1.

This comes as bird flu has been spreading across North America and other regions of the world, infecting various types of animals and humans.\n\n\"On 23 May 2024, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City.\n\n\"This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\" -WHO\n\nThe WHO's statement continued:\n\n\"... confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The case had multiple underlying medical conditions.

This data is for the US. Adding mice to the list (the blue circle in New Mexico).\"\n\nKoopmans also published a USDA map showing bird flu detections in an ever-expanding list of mammals.\n\nSTAT News recently spoke with Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier, a leading expert on the bird flu, who provided some insight into the outbreak:\n\n\"You have massive outbreaks in wild birds. It spreads over into poultry quite easily. But in humans we see lower numbers, and that to me suggests that the zoonotic risk has decreased.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nita Madhav, a former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researcher who is now senior director of epidemiology and modeling at Ginkgo Biosecurity, warned Scientific American, \"The more it spreads within mammals, that gives it more chances to mutate. As it mutates, as it changes, there is a greater chance it can infect humans. If it gains the ability to spread efficiently from person to person, then it would be hard to stop.\"\n\nAbout a week ago, news broke the Biden Administration was nearing a deal to bankroll Moderna's vaccine against bird flu.\n\nRemember Deborah Birx, a physician who served as former President Trump's Covid response coordinator? Well, she said earlier today about weekly testing of the nation's cattle herd population.\n\n\"We should be testing every cow weekly,\" Birx said, adding, \"We could be pool testing every dairy worker.\"\n\nJordan Schachtel notes...\n\nThe WHO's chief scientist, Jeremy Farrar, has recently said the bird flu amongst cows \"is very concerning.\"\n\nIn recent notes, we penned \"The Escalating Threat Of Avian Influenza H5N1 And The Ethical Quandary Of Gain-of-Function Research\" and \"Former CDC Director Sounds Alarm Over Bird Flu Experiments.\"\n\nThe question arises: if human-to-human cases surge and it's clear that the WHO's focus for this pandemic is cows, what actions will the government be forced to take regarding these animals? However, don't worry -- if cows are culled to save the planet from bird flu, Bill Gates will be ready to offer cricket burgers and fake meat New York strips.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com",

laboratory tests, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first fatal case of the A(H5N2) subtype of avian influenza in a human in Mexico.\n\nThis is the first global case of human infection with this specific strain and the first human H5N2 case reported in Mexico.\n\nThe deceased, a 59-year-old resident of Mexico State, died in a Mexico City hospital on April 24 after experiencing symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea, and general discomfort.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" the WHO mentioned in its announcement.\n\nDespite no reported contact with poultry or other animals, the individual reportedly had underlying medical conditions and was bedridden for weeks before developing severe symptoms.\n\nIn March, Mexican authorities reported an isolated outbreak of A(H5N2) in western Michoac\u00e1n, assuring the public there was no risk to farms or human health.\n\nFollowing the April death, however, Mexico confirmed the presence of the virus and promptly reported the case to the WHO.\n\nNo indication of the virus being transmissible between humans\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that current information suggests that \"this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans\", and assesses \"the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.\"\n\nContact tracing identified no additional cases.\n\nIndividuals who had contact with the deceased were tested for various influenza strains and COVID-19, with all results negative.\n\nWhile avian influenza has been detected in mammals like seals and cattle, this is primarily due to contact with infected birds.\n\nScientists are vigilant for mutations that could make the virus more transmissible among humans.\n\nThe United States reported three human infections since March, likely from exposure to infected dairy cows.\n\nTwo cases showed only conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May but without evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\nThey did identify additional cases of avian influenza H7 in poultry farms.\n\nThe Hellenic Society of Infectious Diseases has already published informational

The man, who had prior health complications died in hospital on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, Diarrhoea, nausea, and general discomfort, the World Health Organization said in a statement on Wednesday, local time.\n\nThis marks the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A (H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico, the WHO said.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A (H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" the WHO said.\n\nThe global health body said that the current risk to the general population posed by this virus is low.\n\nAbout The Patient\n\nThe patient had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals but had had multiple underlying medical conditions and was bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms, the WHO said.\n\nThe health agency said it's not been possible to establish whether this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nOutbreak Of H5N2 Detected In Michoacan\n\nIn March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoacan, which borders the State of Mexico where the patient was residing. Additionally, in March 2024, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) was identified in poultry in Texcoco, State of Mexico, and a second outbreak of LPAI A(H5N2) in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state.\n\nThus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nAustralia's First Human Case Of A (H5N1) Infection Reported\n\nAustralia's first human case of A (H5N1) infection was reported in May, but there were no signs of transmission.\n\nThe first detection of the H7 HPAI strain was confirmed on May 22 this year at a poultry farm near Meredith, Victoria. On May 24, Agriculture Victoria's tracing activities identified a separate H7 HPAI strain on a poultry farm near Terang. On June 3 ,H7 HPAI was confirmed at a third Victorian poultry farm.\n\n\"Avian influenza virus has been confirmed at a fourth Victorian poultry farm,\" the Australian government said in a statement on Wednesday as cited by Reuters.\n\nAbout Outbreak Of H5N1 Strain Of Bird Flu In US\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu first reported in US poultry farms in the year 2022 in millions of birds as well as older dairy cows has spread to three farmworkers -one in Texas and two in Michigan.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low.\n\nABC News cited Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital as explaining that \"while both H5N2 and H5N1 belong to the same family of influenza A viruses, H5N1 has been known to infect humans for years, whereas this is the first-ever reported case of H5N2 in humans.\"\n\n\"The good news is that neither H5N2 nor H5N1 have demonstrated human-to-human transmission so far. However, this first case is a wake-up call. It reminds us that influenza viruses can evolve, and continued surveillance of these viruses in both animals and humans is crucial,\" he told ABC News.\n\nAbout Animal Influenza Viruses\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis, and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza, the WHO said.",

A spokesperson of the WHO also said that this is the first-ever lab-confirmed case of the infection, the influenza A(H5N2) virus which is reported globally and is also the first A(H5) virus infection. Doctors said that the case was associated with several health problems and health authorities are now focused on detecting and ascertaining the source of the virus and its exposure.\n\nAs per the WHO, the victim did not have a history of exposure to the virus. But so far, cases of A(H5N2) of bird flu have been reported in poultry in Mexico. The patient was also bed ridden for weeks before the symptoms started to appear.\n\nThe H5N2 is a sub-type of the avian influenza virus. This subtype is likely to affect a variety of birds such as ducks, chickens, flacons, ostriches and turkeys. Birds affected by the same do not usually look ill, but it can also get transmitted to humans. When it affects humans, the virus is likely to result in mild to severe infections of the upper respiratory tract. However, it must never be taken lightly as it can be fatal as well.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of bird flu?\n\nDoctors have for a long time raised concerns regarding rising cases of bird flu and have said that it is likely to be 100 times more powerful than coronavirus. Experts said that it is further important to highlight that the strain could be different from the first reported ones.

Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nAustralia's first human case of A (H5N1) infection was reported in May, but there were no signs of transmission.\n\nThe first detection of the H7 HPAI strain was confirmed on May 22 this year at a poultry farm near Meredith, Victoria. On May 24, Agriculture Victoria's tracing activities identified a separate H7 HPAI strain on a poultry farm near Terang. On June 3 ,H7 HPAI was confirmed at a third Victorian poultry farm.\n\n\"Avian influenza virus has been confirmed at a fourth Victorian poultry farm,\" the Australian government said in a statement on Wednesday as cited by Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu first reported in US poultry farms in the year 2022 in millions of birds as well as older dairy cows has spread to three farmworkers -one in Texas and two in Michigan.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low.\n\nABC News cited Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation office at Boston Children's Hospital as explaining that \"while both H5N2 and H5N1 belong to the same family of influenza A viruses, H5N1 has been known to infect humans for years, whereas this is the first-ever reported case of H5N2 in humans.\"\n\n\"The good news is that neither H5N2 nor H5N1 have demonstrated human-to-human transmission so far. However, this first case is a wake-up call. It reminds us that influenza viruses can evolve, and continued surveillance of these viruses in both animals and humans is crucial,\" he told ABC News.\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans.\n\nInfections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.\n\nDepending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza, the WHO said.

The case represents the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with this bird flu subtype worldwide, according to the news release. The deceased, a 59-year-old resident of Mexico with no known exposure to poultry or other animals, developed symptoms including fever, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and general malaise April 17.\n\nHe was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City last April 24 and passed away on the same day. The patient had underlying health conditions and had been bedridden for other reasons for three weeks before contracting the bird flu, the news release stated. (RELATED: 'Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza' Outbreaks Erupt Globally, Forcing Countries To Issue Significant Alerts)\n\nAfter the patient's death, tests confirmed an infection with the H5N2 bird flu subtype, a strain never before seen in humans, the news release added. WHO then monitored 17 people who had contact with the patient in the hospital. Although one individual reported a runny nose, all tested negative for influenza and COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, health authorities tested 12 more contacts from the patient's neighborhood, including seven who showed symptoms. Nasal and throat samples tested negative for COVID-19, but the results of the blood tests are still pending, WHO stated. Despite this case, the organization maintains that the risk to the general population remains low. However, they emphasize the importance of continued vigilance and surveillance, given the potential public health impact of human infections with bird flu.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has recently faced outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, impacting millions of birds and several older dairy cows. Three farmworkers contracted the virus, exhibiting only mild symptoms, according to the organization.

(Image credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\nA person in Mexico has died after catching the first known human case of H5N2 bird flu.\n\nThe fatal case marks the first time someone in Mexico has been sickened by any type of influenza A(H5) virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported Wednesday (June 5). This broad category of virus also includes the one currently circulating among U.S. dairy cows, called H5N1, which recently sickened three people who had close contact with cattle.\n\nWhen it's caused sporadic infections in people, H5N1 has led to severe pneumonia and death in at least 50% of cases. The recent fatality in Mexico shows that H5N2 can also be deadly to humans.\n\nThe spread of bird flu to people is concerning, in part, because these viruses can be deadly. Another reason for concern is that the more times bird flu jumps into people, the more chances it has to pick up mutations and gain the ability to spread easily between humans. As of yet, no A(H5) viruses can sustainably spread from person to person, the WHO reported -- but that could change in the future.\n\nRelated: 'Increased evidence that we should be alert': H5N1 bird flu is adapting to mammals in 'new ways'\n\nFor now, though, \"based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus [H5N2] as low,\" the agency reported.\n\nThe recent case in Mexico involved a 59-year-old who developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise in mid-April. The person sought medical treatment at a Mexico City hospital on April 24 but died the same day \"due to complications of his condition.\" The individual had multiple underlying conditions and had already been bedridden for other reasons for three weeks prior to developing any bird flu symptoms, his relatives reported.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nA sample of the patient's respiratory fluids, taken April 24, revealed he'd had H5N2. The virus is similar to H5N1, in that both viruses carry the same type of protein -- H5 -- on their surfaces, but a second protein called neuraminidase (N) is a slightly different shape on each virus.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the person had had no recent contact with poultry or other animals; typically, people catch bird flu through contact with sick or dead animals, or from contact with materials those animals contaminated with the virus. Notably, H5N2 viruses have recently been spreading among poultry in Mexico, raising an opportunity for the virus to spread to people. Authorities in Mexico are still investigating the potential source of the patient's fatal infection.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n-- Bird flu wipes out over 95% of southern elephant seal pups in 'catastrophic' mass death\n\n-- 32 diseases you can catch from animals\n\n-- 1st polar bear death from bird flu spells trouble for species\n\nSo far, none of the person's close contacts have tested positive for bird flu, and there's no evidence the virus has spread between people. \"This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza,\" the agency reiterated in its statement.\n\nSince people generally catch A(H5) viruses from animals or from handling those animals' bodily fluids, you can reduce the risk of bird flu by avoiding sick and dead animals and regularly washing your hands with soap and water. In the U.S., dairy workers have been advised to wear personal protective equipment around potentially sick animals, as an additional safety measure, and authorities have also emphasized that drinking raw milk could pose a risk to consumers.\n\nAgain, the risk of transmission to the general public is low and overall these bird flu infections are rare. Should you catch an A(H5) virus, existing drugs for seasonal flu can help treat the infection.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\n\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

The WHO said that, at this point, just how the person contracted the virus is unknown, although H5N2 is known to circulate in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThe person was already in a weakened state, bedridden for three weeks with other underlying medical conditions before developing symptoms of bird flu in mid-April. Those symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\n\nOn April 24, the person was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, but died of complications that day, the WHO said.\n\nDoctors sent a sample obtained from the patient which was confirmed to be positive for H5N2 by two separate labs.\n\nThe virus does not seem to be easily transmitted: Of 17 people who'd had contact with the patient in the hospital, none have become infected.\n\nTwelve more people living near the patient's home were also tested, seven of who had symptoms, but none tested positive for COVID-19 or any kind of flu. Ongoing blood testing is being conducted to see if any antibodies point to past infections.\n\nThe WHO noted that in March, an outbreak of H5N2 had been identified at a poultry farm in a neighboring region, although its unclear if that outbreak has any connection to the patient's case.\n\nBird flu has been known to be transmitted to humans from infected animals, and an ongoing outbreak of H5N1 virus in U.S. dairy cows has resulted in three known human cases, all in dairy workers who experienced relatively mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about avian flu at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 923, "textEnd": 931}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nAustralia's first human case of A (H5N1) infection was reported in May, but there were no signs of transmission.\n\nThe first detection of the H7 HPAI strain was confirmed on May 22 this year at a poultry farm near Meredith, Victoria. On May 24, Agriculture Victoria's tracing activities identified a separate H7 HPAI strain on a poultry farm near Terang. On June 3 ,H7 HPAI was confirmed at a third Victorian poultry farm.\n\n\"Avian influenza virus has been confirmed at a fourth Victorian poultry farm,\" the Australian government said in a statement on Wednesday as cited by Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu first reported in US poultry farms in the year 2022 in millions of birds as well as older dairy cows has spread to three farmworkers -one in Texas and two in Michigan.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low.\n\nABC News cited Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation office at Boston Children's Hospital as explaining that \"while both H5N2 and H5N1 belong to the same family of influenza A viruses, H5N1 has been known to infect humans for years, whereas this is the first-ever reported case of H5N2 in humans.\"\n\n\"The good news is that neither H5N2 nor H5N1 have demonstrated human-to-human transmission so far. However, this first case is a wake-up call. It reminds us that influenza viruses can evolve, and continued surveillance of these viruses in both animals and humans is crucial,\" he told ABC News.\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.\n\nDepending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza, the WHO said.

(Image Credits: Pixabay)\n\nBird Flu in Mexico: The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday reported the first human death caused by bird flu in Mexico. The victim, a resident of Mexico, died after suffering from symptoms of avian influenza A (H5N2).\n\nAccording to WHO, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) on 23 May 2024.\n\n\"This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico,\" WHO said in a statement.\n\nAlthough the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico, the global health agency stated.\n\nAccording to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\n'No history of exposure to poultry or other animals'\n\nIn its statement, WHO said that the 59-year-old patient had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. However, he had multiple underlying medical conditions.\n\nThe patient's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\n\n\"On 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition,\" WHO reported.\n\nAccording to the UN health body's statement, results from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus.\n\nOn 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2).\n\nOn 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2).\n\nMeanwhile, no further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation.\n\nOf the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2.\n\n\"12 additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case's residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient's residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. The results of the serological samples are pending,\" WHO stated.\n\nIn March this year, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which borders the State of Mexico where the patient was residing.\n\nWhat are the causes of H5N2 bird flu infection?\n\nUsually, animal influenza viruses circulate in animals but can also infect humans.

The WHO said it wasn't clear how the man became infected, although H5N2 has been reported in poultry in Mexico.\n\n\"On 23 May 2024, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalised in Mexico City. This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico,\" the WHO said in its official statement.\n\nAlthough the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico, it said. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\nDescription of the situation\n\nOn 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalised in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\n\nOn 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition.\n\nResults from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2).\n\nOn 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2).\n\nNo further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case's residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient's residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. The results of the serological samples are pending.\n\nIn March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which borders the State of Mexico where the case was residing\n\nAdditionally, in March 2024, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) was identified in poultry in Texcoco, State of Mexico, and a second outbreak of LPAI A(H5N2) in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state. Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks.\n\nA study describing the continuous circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 viruses in Mexico and spread to several other countries was published in 2022.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival prospects for some cases.\n\nThis is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally, and the first A(H5) virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. The case had multiple underlying conditions, and the investigation by the health authorities in Mexico is ongoing to determine the likely source of exposure to the virus. Influenza A(H5N2) viruses have been detected in poultry in Mexico recently.\n\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Human cases of infection with other H5 subtypes including A(H5N1), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses have been reported previously. Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses from previous events have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans, thus the current likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. According to the information available thus far, no further human cases of infection with A(H5N2) associated with this case have been detected.\n\nThere are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (in human and birds) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.\n\nBased on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information, including information on A(H5N2) viruses detected in local animal populations, become available.\n\nWHO advice\n\nThis case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.\n\nDue to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human and animal health and timely virus-sharing for risk assessment.\n\nWhen there has been human exposure to a known outbreak of an influenza A virus in domestic poultry, wild birds or other animals or when there has been an identified human case of infection with such a virus, enhanced surveillance in potentially exposed human populations becomes necessary. Enhanced surveillance should consider the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the population. It could include a range of active and passive healthcare and/or community-based approaches, including enhanced surveillance in local ARI/ILI/ SARI systems, active screening in hospitals and of groups that may be at higher occupational risk of exposure, and inclusion of other sources such as traditional healers, private practitioners and private diagnostic laboratories.\n\nIn the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of a history of exposure to animals and/or travel should be undertaken along with contact tracing. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from suspected human cases should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.\n\nTravellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that may have been contaminated with animal faeces. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this occurs, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\nAll human infections caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype are notifiable under the IHR, and State Parties to the regulations are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\n\nWHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions regarding the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author",

As per WHO, the 59-year-old person had been hospitalised in Mexico City and died on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general discomfort.\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" WHO said in a statement.\n\nKNOW ALL ABOUT THE H5N2 STRAIN OF BIRD FLU\n\nBird flu has been rampantly spreading across farms in countries like the US, UK, France, Japan and Australia, among others. Several strains of the virus have been detected till now with H5N1 being the most prominent among birds.\n\nKnown as avian influenza, the virus usually doesn't affect humans. However, there are been rare fatal cases.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses have been responsible for most human illness from avian influenza viruses reported worldwide to date, including the most serious illnesses with high mortality.\n\nBirds infected by the virus, shed the influenza through their saliva, mucous and feces.\n\nOther animals infected with avian influenza viruses may have the virus present in respiratory secretions, different organs, blood, or in other body fluids, including animal milk.\n\nThe H5N2 strain has been detected in poultry farms in Mexico recently. The strain is a subtype of the species Influenzavirus A.\n\nBirds infected by this strain usually do not appear ill but might show mild symptoms.\n\nCertain variants of this subtype are significantly more pathogenic than others, and outbreaks of the \"high-path\" H5N2 strain occasionally lead to the culling of thousands of birds on poultry farms.\n\nThe symptoms of H5N2 are similar to the H5N1 strain, but milder in form. Fever, cough, body aches and shortness of breath are common signs of the strain.\n\nAs per WHO, whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.\n\nTherefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.\n\nEpidemiological and virological evidence indicates that A(H5) viruses from past events have not developed the capability for sustained human-to-human transmission, making the current likelihood of such spread low.\n\nThere are no vaccines for preventing the influenza A(H5) viruses. However, candidate vaccines to prevent this virus in humans have been developed for \"pandemic preparedness purposes.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N6", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saliva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/outbreaks-of-the-high-path-h5n2-strain-occasionally-lead-to-the-culling-of-thousands-of-birds-on-p-060804301-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ZEjtiykRYylX8DSgtVoI8fuSJmfSOnGF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 357, "textEnd": 365}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Although the virus had been reported in poultry in the nation, this is the first human case. The source of the patient's exposure to the virus remains unknown, as he had no history of contact with poultry or other animals and was bedridden due to an underlying illness.\n\nThe WHO confirmed this as the first laboratory-confirmed human case of influenza A(H5N2) infection globally and the first such infection reported in a person in Mexico. On May 23, Mexican health authorities notified the international organization about the confirmed human infection with the avian influenza A(H5N2) virus.\n\nAccording to family members, the patient already had other health conditions but developed fever, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, nausea, and general malaise on April 17. On April 24, he sought medical attention and was admitted to the 'Ismael Cos\u00edo Villegas' National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), where he died the same day due to complications from his illness.\n\nAt INER, 17 contacts of the patient were identified, one of whom reported nasal discharge between April 28 and 29, according to the WHO. An additional 12 contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the victim's residence.\n\nThis case emerges as the H5N1 avian flu virus has spread among dairy cows in the United States. While three human cases have been recorded in the U.S. this year, American health authorities have clarified that none are related to the outbreak in cows. H5N1 is a highly contagious subtype of avian flu among birds.\n\nAt the end of March, it was reported that dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were infected with avian flu. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed cases in a herd of dairy cows in Michigan that had been in contact with animals from Texas.\n\nIn Mexico, on April 5, the National Service for Health, Safety and Quality (Senasica) declared the country free of avian flu A(H5N2), stating that the virus had been absent for over 25 years, with the last confirmed case in commercial production dating back to June 5, 1995.\n\nMexican authorities have not provided further information on the case reported to the WHO at this time. The WHO emphasized the need for continuous surveillance and the potential development of vaccines in the event of an avian flu pandemic, estimating that vaccines could be produced within four months

The WHO emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe 59-year-old man passed away in Mexico City in April after experiencing symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. His relatives reported that he had been bedridden for three weeks due to other health issues before these acute symptoms emerged. The man's underlying conditions included chronic kidney failure, diabetes, and high blood pressure, as stated by Mexico's public health department.\n\nThe man sought hospital care on April 24 and died the same day. Initial tests revealed an unidentified type of flu, which was later confirmed to be A(H5N2) through lab testing. This marks the first globally reported, laboratory-confirmed human case of A(H5N2) infection.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, noted that the man's prior health conditions increased his risk of severe influenza. However, the source of his infection remains unknown. The WHO mentioned that A(H5N2) cases have been found in poultry in Mexico, including a backyard chicken farm in Michoacan state, near the man's residence, but no direct connection has been established.\n\nDespite testing those who had contact with the deceased at home and in the hospital, no further human cases have been found. The WHO and Mexico's Ministry of Health both assess the current risk to the general population as low, with the Ministry of Health confirming that all samples from identified contacts have tested negative.\n\nAuthorities are monitoring farms near the man's home and have established a permanent surveillance system to detect other cases in local wildlife. The spread of different bird flu variants, including A(H5N1), has been ongoing among animal species in various countries since 2020. In the US, A(H5N1) was detected in dairy herds in March, with a few human cases reported among farm workers, though these were mild.\n\nPekosz highlighted the propensity of H5 viruses to infect mammals, emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring to prevent the virus from accumulating mutations that could enhance human infection. This caution aligns with the historical pattern of H5 viruses since 1997.\n\nA(H5N1) is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that has caused outbreaks in birds and sporadic cases in humans. It poses a significant public health concern due to its potential to cause severe illness and death in both poultry and humans. Human infections with A(H5N1) are usually linked to direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. While human-to-human transmission is rare, the virus has the potential to mutate and become more easily transmissible among humans, raising concerns about its pandemic potential. Vaccination campaigns in poultry and strict surveillance measures are key strategies for controlling the spread of A(H5N1).", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2024-06/photo_verybig_226488.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 709, "textEnd": 717}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The WHO said that, at this point, just how the person contracted the virus is unknown, although H5N2 is known to circulate in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThe person was already in a weakened state, bedridden for three weeks with other underlying medical conditions before developing symptoms of bird flu in mid-April. Those symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\n\nOn April 24, the person was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, but died of complications that day, the WHO said.\n\nDoctors sent a sample obtained from the patient which was confirmed to be positive for H5N2 by two separate labs.\n\nThe virus does not seem to be easily transmitted: Of 17 people who'd had contact with the patient in the hospital, none have become infected.\n\nTwelve more people living near the patient's home were also tested, seven of who had symptoms, but none tested positive for COVID-19 or any kind of flu.

This has yet again sent chills down the spine of the medical fraternity. A 59-year-old man contracted a very new kind of virus, which is reported to be a subtype of avian influenza, and was hospitalized in Mexico City after which he passed away, according to a recent report by NBC News. WHO has confirmed that this is the first lab-confirmed case of human infection from the H5N2 subtype virus which has been reported in Mexico.\n\nBefore the man succumbed to this subtype virus, he was showing symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and overall discomfort. The man passed away on April 24 after being admitted to a hospital in Mexico City, and he was bedridden for at least three weeks with several underlying medical conditions, according to reports. WHO has finally confirmed that this was the first case of A(H5N2) infection in the human body.\n\nInterestingly, the man did not have any reported contact with poultry or other animals and according to WHO, no other cases of this subtype affecting humans have been reported as of now. The current strain of virus affecting US residents is H5N1, which is a largely different strain from H5N2.\n\nAfter the man fell ill, which is ascertained to be due to the various underlying symptoms from the virus, he sought medical care on April 24 at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER) in Mexico City and passed away on the very same day due to medical complications, according to reports.\n\nIt has still not been understood where the man may have come in contact with the virus.

This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally. However, the current risk of bird flu virus to the general population is low, according to WHO.\n\nIn March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which borders the State of Mexico. The virus was detected in a 59-year-old residing in the area. On April 24, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalised at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, and died the same day due to complications of his condition.\n\nThe case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms. Mexico's health reported the person to have chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. However, the case had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico.\n\nNo further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Scientists said the case is unrelated to the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the United States that has so far infected three dairy farm workers. Australia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.\n\nA study describing the continuous circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 viruses in Mexico and spread to several other countries was published in 2022.\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival prospects for some cases.\n\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Human cases of infection with other H5 subtypes including A(H5N1), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses have been reported previously. Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses from previous events have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans, thus the current likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low.\n\nThere are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterisation of the most recent viruses (in human and birds) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.\n\nThis case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.", "source": {"uri": "expresshealthcare.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express Healthcare"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Health_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Health Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pan American Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase_inhibitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuraminidase inhibitor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Epidemiology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Epidemiology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.expresshealthcare.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/08105358/WHO-better-logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 889, "textEnd": 897}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The victim, a 59-year-old resident of Mexico, succumbed to avian influenza A (H5N2), marking the first documented human case of the virus.\n\nThe individual passed away on April 24 in Mexico City after experiencing symptoms including fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort. While the exact source of exposure to the virus remains unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been previously reported in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThis development has prompted concerns about the potential spread of avian flu, particularly given its lethality and the possibility of human-to-human transmission. The WHO emphasized that although cases of bird flu have been identified in various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, the current risk to the general population remains low.\n\nThe incident in Mexico comes amid a global uptick in bird flu cases, with notable outbreaks reported in different parts of the world. In the United States, for instance, three cases of human infection were reported after exposure to infected cows during an outbreak detected in dairy cattle in March. Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, although there were no signs of transmission. Additionally, poultry cases of H7 bird flu have been identified on farms in Victoria state, Australia.\n\nHealth authorities are closely monitoring the situation, particularly for any signs of the virus adapting to facilitate human-to-human transmission. Scientists remain vigilant for any changes in the virus's behavior that could indicate an increased risk to public health.\n\nIn response to the incident, Mexican authorities swiftly reported the case to the WHO, which initiated an investigation to trace potential contacts and ascertain the scope of the outbreak.

In recent weeks, there was already enough concern about the potential for a major H5N1 outbreak among humans. Dairy cows throughout the U.S. have been getting infected with that version of the bird flu, and three dairy workers have tested positive. A full-blown H5N1 outbreak among humans would have the potential to be catastrophic, but we don't even know what an H5N2 outbreak among humans would look like because there never has been one. So far, we have one confirmed case and one death.\n\nIf it is confirmed that there is human to human transmission of H5N2 going on, the masks, lockdowns, shots and public hysteria that we witnessed a couple of years ago could return in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe person that just died after catching H5N2 lived in Mexico, and we are being told that this individual had no exposure to poultry or other animals.\n\nThe following comes directly from the official World Health Organization website...\n\nOn 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\n\nOn 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition.\n\nResults from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). On 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2).\n\nIf this person didn't catch it from a bird or some other animal, how was this individual infected?\n\nAnd did this person spread H5N2 to others before finally seeking medical attention?\n\nIt is being reported that this is the very first human case of H5N2 that has ever been confirmed by a lab...\n\nThis was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with A(H5N2) subtype of bird flu reported globally and the first H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico.\n\nThis individual could have potentially spread the disease to hundreds or even thousands of others.\n\nIf that is what actually happened, it may already be too late to contain it.\n\nOne expert that was recently asked about a potential bird flu pandemic admitted that \"we're in big trouble\" once it starts spreading among humans on a widespread basis...\n\n\"All of our efforts need to be focused on preventing those events from happening,\" said Matthew Miller, co-director of the Canadian Pandemic Preparedness Hub at McMaster University.\n\n\"Once we have widespread infections of humans, we're in big trouble.\"\n\nHowever, if more confirmed cases of H5N2 start popping up that would definitely be cause for concern.\n\nOf course H5N1 also continues to alarm the experts.\n\nThis week, we learned that 11 house mice in the state of New Mexico have tested positive for H5N1...\n\nHouse mice have become the latest mammal to become infected with H5N1 bird flu, sparking fears that the almost omnipresent pests could spread the virus to humans.\n\nEleven house mice in the state of New Mexico - where several herds of dairy cattle are infected with H5N1 - tested positive for the avian influenza, new data released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has shown.\n\nOne of the reasons why this is causing so much concern is because there are millions upon millions of mice living all around us, and in many cases our own homes are infested with them...\n\nThe discovery of the virus in mice is particularly alarming, as it significantly raises the risk of human transmission and further spread, say experts.\n\nMice live in unnervingly close proximity to humans: they scurry beneath floorboards, hide in cupboards and roam our offices, larders and restaurants.\n\nIt is important to remember that the bubonic plague was spread all over Europe by mice.\n\nSo this will be something that we will want to keep a very close eye on.\n\nInterestingly, scientists recently conducted a study which proves that mice can become infected with H5N1 after drinking raw milk from dairy cows...\n\nA new study published Friday provides more evidence of the potential danger of drinking unpasteurized, or raw, milk containing H5N1 avian flu viruses.\n\nThe work, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that mice that were fed milk from H5N1-infected cows became very ill.\n\nThe study cannot prove that what happened to the mice would definitely happen to people who drink raw milk containing the dangerous virus, but it underscores the probable risk, experts said. Studies like this cannot be conducted in people, for ethical reasons.\n\nIn my latest book, I have an entire chapter entitled \"Pestilences\" because I am entirely convinced that global outbreaks of disease will be one of the major themes of the next several years.\n\nThe bird flu has already resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds all over the globe, and now it is infecting dairy cows, domestic cats and mice here in the United States.\n\nMany scientists believe that it is just a matter of time before there is a bird flu pandemic among humans.\n\nI don't know if that is true or not.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki",

This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\nDescription of the situation\n\nOn 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The case's relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\n\nOn 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition.\n\nResults from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). On 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2).\n\nNo further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case's residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient's residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. The results of the serological samples are pending.\n\nIn March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which borders the State of Mexico where the case was residing\n\nAdditionally, in March 2024, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) was identified in poultry in Texcoco, State of Mexico, and a second outbreak of LPAI A(H5N2) in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state. Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks (1).\n\nA study describing the continuous circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 viruses in Mexico and spread to several other countries was published in 2022 (2).\n\nEpidemiology\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival prospects for some cases.\n\nPublic health response\n\nLocal and national health authorities implemented the following public health measures:\n\nEpidemiological investigation of case and contacts.Monitoring of health care workers with a history of contact with the patient.Monitoring and surveillance of influenza-like respiratory illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in neighbouring municipalities (within the same health region), in order to analyze the behaviour and trends of respiratory syndromes and viruses in the region.Analysis of the trends of pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, acute respiratory infections, and conjunctivitis by the health services of Mexico City and the State of Mexico.Identification of transmission chains and risk factors in the municipality where the case resided, the State of Mexico and surrounding areas.Training on the National Guide for preparedness, prevention and response to an outbreak or zoonotic influenza event at the animal-human interface.Communicated with animal and environmental health authorities to strengthen surveillance activities in poultry and wild birds near the case's residence and areas with a history of low pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreaks.\n\nPAHO/WHO implemented the following measures:\n\nStrengthening routine and event surveillance on the human-animal interface with WHO Collaborating Centers and strategic partners.Improvement of molecular diagnostic capacity for detection of zoonotic diseases through knowledge transfer, training and technical support with recent emphasis in avian influenza A(H5N1)Strengthening national capacity for the prompt shipment of human and animal samples to WHO collaborating centers for additional characterization and/or vaccine composition analysis.Regular risk assessment for transmissibility and severity for zoonotic viruses.Update of guidelines on influenza surveillance and response at the human-animal interface.Revision of experiences in response and lessons learned from countries that experienced zoonotic influenza outbreaks.Technical strengthening of risk communication capacities for events at the human-animal interface.Clinical management training on zoonotic influenza treatment, infection prevention and control (IPC), and reorganization of health services.Animal carcass handling training, including IPC technical aspects.PAHO published recommendations to strengthen intersectoral work in surveillance, early detection, and research at the human animal interface.WHO risk assessment\n\nThis is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally, and the first A(H5) virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. The case had multiple underlying conditions, and the investigation by the health authorities in Mexico is ongoing to determine the likely source of exposure to the virus. Influenza A(H5N2) viruses have been detected in poultry in Mexico recently.\n\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Human cases of infection with other H5 subtypes including A(H5N1), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses have been reported previously. Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses from previous events have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans, thus the current likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. According to the information available thus far, no further human cases of infection with A(H5N2) associated with this case have been detected.\n\nThere are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (in human and birds) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.\n\nBased on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information, including information on A(H5N2) viruses detected in local animal populations, become available.\n\nWHO advice\n\nThis case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.\n\nDue to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human and animal health and timely virus-sharing for risk assessment.\n\nWhen there has been human exposure to a known outbreak of an influenza A virus in domestic poultry, wild birds or other animals or when there has been an identified human case of infection with such a virus, enhanced surveillance in potentially exposed human populations becomes necessary. Enhanced surveillance should consider the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the population. It could include a range of active and passive healthcare and/or community-based approaches, including enhanced surveillance in local ARI/ILI/ SARI systems, active screening in hospitals and of groups that may be at higher occupational risk of exposure, and inclusion of other sources such as traditional healers, private practitioners and private diagnostic laboratories.\n\nIn the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of a history of exposure to animals and/or travel should be undertaken along with contact tracing. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from suspected human cases should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.\n\nTravellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that may have been contaminated with animal faeces. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this occurs, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\nAll human infections caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype are notifiable under the IHR, and State Parties to the regulations are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\n\nWHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions regarding the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\n\nLINK: [http://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/iten/2024-DON520]\n\nReferences:\n\nCitable reference: World Health Organization (5 June 2024).

a statement on Wednesday, said the 59-year-old died in Mexico City in April after developing symptoms including a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea and nausea.\n\nThe man's relatives said he had already been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before the onset of his acute symptoms.\n\nMexico's public health department said in a statement that the man's underlying ailments included chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nHe sought hospital care on April 24 and died on the same day.\n\nInitial tests showed an unidentified type of flu that subsequent weeks of lab testing confirmed was A(H5N2), the WHO said.\n\nIt was the \"first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally\", the agency added.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University in the United States, told the Reuters news agency that the man's prior health conditions put him at \"a risk of more severe influenza\".\n\nBut

The global health body has warned that the virus could spread massively across the world, infecting more lives in the upcoming years. The victim, a 59-year-old resident of Mexico, succumbed to avian influenza A (H5N2), marking the first documented human case of the virus.\n\nAccording to the reports, the infected man died on April 24 in Mexico City after experiencing bird flusymptoms including fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea, and general discomfort. This death has prompted serious concerns about the potential spread of avian flu (bird flu), particularly given its lethality and the possibility of human-to-human transmission.\n\nEarlier this year, experts sounded alarm for the upcoming pandemic which might be triggered by the bird flu-causing H5N2 virus. In a press meeting, the scientists said, \"The virus is getting close to a tipping point where it might start a worldwide pandemic\". So, what is this virus, how does it spread, and what symptoms can it make you suffer? Let's uncover this new mystery in today's article.\n\nThe H5N2 virus is a strain of the Influenza A virus that mainly targets birds, especially those kept for meat and eggs. The family tree of this particular virus includes the Orthomyxoviridae clan, emblematic of causing severe diseases in the bird kingdom. However, in recent times, the virus has been found infecting humans, and recently, WHO has confirmed one person's death as well. What gives this virus its name and capabilities as an infectious agent are two proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).\n\nIts domain is normally limited to the bird realm, yet certain strains sometimes leap species, causing bird flu cases among humans. It spreads through direct interaction with infected birds or their waste, creating a significant hazard for those in contact with poultry, like farm workers or bird handlers. Some of the most common symptoms that a human can experience when the bird flu virus infects them are:\n\nThe virus can escalate to breathing challenges and pneumonia, especially among individuals with compromised immunity.\n\nThe incident in Mexico comes amid a global uptick in bird flu cases, with notable outbreaks reported in different parts of the world. Scroll down to know how you can stay safe from this virus infection, and what you can do when you are infected with H5N1.\n\nThe death of a Mexican man due to bird flu infection has sparked a global concern about the safety precautions to stop the virus from spreading. Here are some of the essential things that one needs to know:\n\nMake sure to reduce your interaction with the live or wild birds, especially in surroundings with previously recorded outbreaks.\n\nMake sure to never forget to wash your hands using soap and water, particularly after bird handling or poultry farm visits.\n\nBe sure to cook your poultry products at the suggested temperature to eliminate lurking viruses. Stay away from raw or half-cooked poultry treats.\n\nThe confirmation of the first human death from bird flu underscores the importance of continued surveillance and vigilance in monitoring the spread of infectious diseases, particularly those with pandemic potential.", "source": {"uri": "thehealthsite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thehealthsite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-to-human_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human-to-human transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuraminidase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hemagglutinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://st1.thehealthsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bird-Flu-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 54, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The case had multiple underlying conditions, and the investigation by the health authorities in Mexico is ongoing to determine the likely source of exposure to the virus.\"\n\nBrits are now being reminded to keep an eye out for symptoms of the disease. Bird flu, also known as avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds, but in rare cases, it can also affect humans. A number of strains of bird flu have caused concern in recent years, but the H5N2 strain, which the patient in Mexico died from, had never been previously seen in humans.\n\nSymptoms of bird flu\n\nAccording to the NHS, the key symptoms of bird flu can appear quickly and often manifest as:\n\nA high temperature, or feeling hot or shivery, aching muscles A headache A cough or shortness of breath\n\nOther early symptoms may include:\n\nDiarrhoea Sickness Stomach pain Chest pain Bleeding from the nose and gums Conjunctivitis\n\nIt usually takes around 3 to 5 days for initial symptoms to appear once a person is infected. But, severe complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, can develop within just days of symptoms appearing. Its recommended to get treatment quickly and use antiviral medicine to prevent complications or severe illness from forming.\n\nThe disease is spread by close contact with an infected bird, dead or alive. This includes touching infected birds, droppings or bedding, or killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking. Another possible source of bird flu is markets where live birds are sold. It's advised to steer clear of these markets when travelling to countries that have reported an outbreak of the virus.\n\nHow to avoid catching bird flu\n\nIf you're visiting an area that has experienced an outbreak you should:\n\nWash your hands often with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling food, in particular raw poultry Use different utensils for cooked and raw meat Make sure meat is cooked until steaming hot Avoid contact with live birds and poultry Treatment for bird flu\n\nIf there are concerns you have symptoms of bird flu, you'll be advised to stay at home, or in more serious cases, will be cared for in hospital in isolation. To treat the virus, you may be given an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). These help to reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.\n\nThey are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff, as a preventative measure.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zahra_khaliq@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zahra Khaliq", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdominal pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32970966.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Large-Scale-Avian-Flu-Outbreak-Drives-Up-Price-Of-Eggs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The 59-year-old man, a resident of the State of Mexico in the central part of the country, had fallen ill in April.According to WHO, the man had numerous underlying medical conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks before developing acute symptoms. On April 17, he reported fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise.On April 24, he sought medical attention and was promptly hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), dying the same day.Following his death, health authorities at INER began testing samples collected from the deceased man. On May 8, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). By May 22, the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference confirmed the strain.So far, health authorities do not know the origin of the contagion, since the man had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals.The epidemiological investigation followed 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the patient died and 12 additional contacts identified near the patient's residence, with all testing negative for SARS-Cov-2 and influenza. Although no further cases of avian flu have been reported, the results of all serological samples are pending.Multiple outbreaks of H5N2 have been reported in birds in Mexico, including an outbreak detected at a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoacan, which borders the State of Mexico where the man was residing.Additionally, two outbreaks of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) were reported in two municipalities in the State of Mexico. However, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac\u00e1n", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michoac\u00e1n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michoac\u00e1n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Epidemiology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Epidemiology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 585, "textEnd": 593}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 675, "textEnd": 683}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 926, "textEnd": 931}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1098, "textEnd": 1104}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The WHO said that, at this point, just how the person contracted the virus is unknown, although H5N2 is known to circulate in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThe person was already in a weakened state, bedridden for three weeks with other underlying medical conditions before developing symptoms of bird flu in mid-April. Those symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\n\nOn April 24, the person was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, but died of complications that day, the WHO said.\n\nDoctors sent a sample obtained from the patient which was confirmed to be positive for H5N2 by two separate labs.\n\nThe virus does not seem to be easily transmitted: Of 17 people who'd had contact with the patient in the hospital, none have become infected.\n\nMore from this section \"Doctors Reveal A Simple Change Santa Clara County Residents Can Make for Healthier Hearts \"Doctors Reveal A Simple Change Solano County Residents Can Make for Healthier Hearts \"Doctors Reveal A Simple Change Wapello County Residents Can Make for Healthier Hearts\n\nTwelve more people living near the patient's home were also tested, seven of who had symptoms, but none tested positive for COVID-19 or any kind of flu. Ongoing blood testing is being conducted to see if any antibodies point to past infections.\n\nThe WHO noted that in March, an outbreak of H5N2 had been identified at a poultry farm in a neighboring region, although its unclear if that outbreak has any connection to the patient's case.\n\nBird flu has been known to be transmitted to humans from infected animals, and an ongoing outbreak of H5N1 virus in U.S. dairy cows has resulted in three known human cases, all in dairy workers who experienced relatively mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about avian flu at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSOURCE: World Health Organization, Disease Outbreak News, June 5, 2024\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nDoctors in Mexico have identified the first known case in a human of H5N2 bird flu, a different strain from H5N1.

He had chronic kidney failure and other underlying ailments. Hospital care was sought on April 24 and the man died the same day, the WHO press release has said. H5N2 is a subtype of the avian influenza virus primarily affecting birds.A man's death in Mexico was caused by a strain of bird flu called H5N2 that has never before been found in a human, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. However, the UN agency did not reveal how the man got infected.\n\nThe 59-year-old man died in a Mexico City hospital. He had been bedridden for unrelated reasons before developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea on April 17 and had underlying ailments, including chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure.Hospital care was sought on April 24 and the man died the same day, the WHO press release has said.\n\nH5N2 is a subtype of the avian influenza virus primarily affecting birds, particularly poultry. It is highly contagious among avian species, causing severe respiratory illness and high mortality rates in infected flocks. While H5N2 can occasionally infect humans, such cases are rare and typically occur through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments.\n\nPreventative measures include biosecurity practices in poultry farms, vaccination programs, and monitoring and controlling bird populations to prevent outbreaks. Continued surveillance and research are essential to manage the spread of H5N2 and mitigate its impact on both avian and human health.\n\nWHO explains: Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nHumans can contract bird flu, primarily through direct contact with infected birds, their droppings, or contaminated environments.

The strain has largely gone under the radar, and the outbreak has raised questions about how much damage it could cause.\n\nIn a report about the situation, the WHO explained that they were notified of a human infection on May 23. It was related to a 59-year-old resident of Mexico who had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. He also had several other underlying medical conditions.\n\nHe had already been bedridden for three weeks prior to the onset of acute symptoms of avian flu. On April 17, he started experiencing \"fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise\". On April 24, he died due to complications from the condition.\n\nThe WHO said that it carried out an epidemiological investigation into the 17 people who came into close contact with the deceased. Only one of them reported having a runny nose.\n\nIt comes shortly after Australia marked its first recorded human case of a virulent strain of bird flu in a child who fell sick after returning from overseas.\n\nThe child contracted the H5N1 strain of the disease, which has been spreading globally and causing widespread deaths among birds, upon returning to the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nThe youngster reportedly suffered a \"severe infection\" after returning from India in March, but has since made a full recovery, Victoria's chief health officer confirmed on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia,\" Dr Clare Looker said. \"The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that takes place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system.\n\n\"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case,\" she added. Avian influenza does not easily spread between humans so the chances of additional cases in people was low, Dr Looker said.\n\nOn the same day, agricultural authorities revealed a different strain of bird flu had been detected in another part of Victoria at an egg farm. Authorities were alerted after a number of poultry deaths at the farm near Meredith, about 40km northwest of Geelong.

Within days, avian influenza was found in several U.S. cows and rapidly spread across state lines, with a dairy worker in Texas testing positive in April for H5N1, a different subtype than the one detected in the man in Mexico.\n\nExperts have criticized federal agencies in the United States for being slow to track and control the outbreak, with nine states observing outbreaks in cows as of Tuesday. Forty-eight states have recorded outbreaks in poultry, according to the CDC.\n\nFour human cases of avian flu have been reported in the United States since April 1; three of the infections followed exposure to dairy cows in Texas and Michigan, while one followed exposure to poultry in Colorado, the CDC said.\n\nFor those in places with known avian influenza outbreaks, WHO recommends avoiding contact with livestock as well as places where animals could have been raised, slaughtered or may have spread their feces.

He quickly developed \"fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise,\" passing away seven days after these symptoms showed.\n\nOther strains of avian flu - including H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 - occasionally infect humans, with those who work in the poultry industry at particular risk. However, no human cases of H5N2 have ever been detected before.\n\nAccording to the WHO, there were three outbreaks of H5N2 at Mexican poultry farms in March and April. However, the agency noted that the deceased did not have any contact with any animals before he fell ill, and could not link the case with any of the recent outbreaks.\n\nTen US states have reported H5N1 infections since late March, with the virus infecting at least three people and spreading to cattle herds in nine states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since late last year, outbreaks have also been reported at poultry farms in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and several other countries.\n\nA total of 888 human cases of H5N1 have been reported worldwide since 2003, 463 of which have been fatal, according to WHO data.\n\nNo further human cases of H5N2 have been detected in Mexico, and the WHO stated that \"the current likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N6", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N8", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N8"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.06/article/6661bb6b85f54011ad2e574d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Tamil Nadu has already set border checkposts for vigilance teams comprising veterinarians and support staff.\n\nAt such locations, vehicles transporting poultry products are being stopped and disinfection measures taken up or are turned back. So far, however, none of such proactive measures have been taken up by Telangana State, which has porous borders with multiple States, including Karnataka.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the most likely route of H5N2 infection to the deceased individual in Mexico could be through poultry. \"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, the H5N2 virus has been reported in poultry in Mexico. A human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype has a potential for high public health impact,\" the WHO said.\n\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Human cases of infection with other H5 subtypes, including A(H5N1), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses, have been reported previously, the WHO made it clear.\n\nThe possibility of human infection, whenever the influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, should be a major reason enough for the Health Department to be proactive and focus on large-scale monitoring, surveillance and genetic testing.",

After an investigation, doctors announced that the patient had died from a type of bird flu (H5N2) that had not previously been seen in humans. Unlike the more frequently discussed H5N1 strain that shows up in cows, H5N2 is most commonly seen in poultry populations. However, the patient in question did not work in the poultry industry and had no known connections to the birds according to his family. This news reached us during the same week that the sainted Anthony Fauci has been providing testimony about his involvement with the laboratory in Wuhan and the true origins of the COVID-19 virus. The two stories may be related in ways that are not immediately obvious to everyone. (Associated Press)\n\nA man's death in Mexico was caused by a strain of bird flu called H5N2 that has never before been found in a human, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.\n\nThe WHO said it wasn't clear how the man became infected, although H5N2 has been reported in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThere are numerous types of bird flu. H5N2 is not the same strain that has infected multiple dairy cow herds in the U.S. That strain is called H5N1 and three farmworkers have gotten mild infections.\n\nBefore anyone begins raising concerns about the possibility of a new, deadly pandemic, there are a few details about the death of the man in Mexico that are notable. Doctors are attributing his death to H5N2 and it appears that he had definitely contracted it. But it seems like a bit of a stretch to say that the bird flu killed him. The man had reportedly been bedridden for weeks and was in very poor health for quite a while. He was suffering from chronic kidney failure, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Had he been in more robust health typical of a man of his age, he might have shrugged off the bird flu as most people do when they contract any species of the flu. In his case, the bird flu may have simply pushed him over the edge.\n\nSo how does this story relate to Fauci and Wuhan? Before beginning, I will remind everyone that I am not a doctor and have had no formal training in this field, so take this with an appropriate grain of salt. But I cover this story frequently and have had to do a lot of research. I believe that the history of the bird flu should tell us something important about the origins of COVID and the gain of function research that was clearly taking place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, funded by Fauci's office.\n\nFirst, consider the fact that doctors and researchers have known about the bird flu in its various forms for quite a while. H5N1 was first detected in the 90s and scientists have been tracking and monitoring it closely ever since. Its true origins will likely never be known beyond the belief that it first showed up in avian species as the name suggests. At some point, it made the jump from birds to cows, taking decades before it became a widespread problem. That process of migration is known as zoonotic spillover. It happens slowly because every virus evolves over time to use all of the available resources it finds in the host. Random mutations produce increasingly well-adapted variations that are more successful, reproduce more readily, and become more powerful and sometimes deadly as a result. But it takes time. In the decades that we've known about the H5N1 bird flu virus, it has infected just three dairy farm workers in the United States, none of whom died.\n\nBut that's not what happened with SARS-CoV-2. If patient zero had contracted COVID after eating a pangolin or a bat, the virus should have been struggling just to survive in its new human host. The person probably wouldn't have even become ill enough to bother seeing a doctor. Yet it wasn't. One person was infected in the vicinity of Wuhan followed by another and then dozens and hundreds more. In almost no time at all it was aboard planes headed for North America and the rest of the world. COVID came out of the gate locked and loaded and ready to run wild in the human body. People were dying, though it was thankfully only a relatively tiny percentage of patients with underlying conditions. How does that not speak to gain of function meddling?\n\nYet the government, at the direction of Dr. Fauci, did its level best to shut down any mention of the lab leak theory. Prominent virologists had their social media accounts shut down after studying the virus and saying that it demonstrated the hallmarks of being modified. Citizens who brought up the possibility were hounded and accused of being conspiracy theorists who were spreading misinformation. Pointing to evidence of the lab leak theory made you a racist with a hatred of the Chinese. To what purpose? Was it all just to prevent Anthony Fauci from having to admit what he'd been up to? Were they afraid of angering the Chinese by suggesting they had been messing around with potentially lethal, biological weapons of mass destruction?

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe World Health Organisation says it has been informed of the first recorded human death from a new strain of flu. The patient had been hospitalised in Mexico City with a strain of bird flu known as H5N2, the WHO said in a statement.\n\nThe WHO said they were notified of a human infection on May 23. The disease was caught by a 59-year-old resident of Mexico who had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals and had several other underlying medical conditions.\n\nHe had already been bedridden for three weeks prior to the onset of acute symptoms of avian flu. On April 17, he started experiencing \"fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise\". On April 24, he died due to complications from the condition.\n\nThe WHO said that it carried out an epidemiological investigation into the 17 people who came into close contact with the deceased. Only one of them reported having a runny nose.\n\nIt comes shortly after Australia marked its first recorded human case of a virulent strain of bird flu in a child who fell sick after returning from overseas. The child contracted the H5N1 strain of the disease, which has been spreading globally and causing widespread deaths among birds, upon returning to the Australian state of Victoria. The youngster reportedly suffered a \"severe infection\" after returning from India in March, but has since made a full recovery, Victoria's chief health officer confirmed on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia,\" Dr Clare Looker said. \"The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that takes place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system.\n\n\"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case,\" she added. Avian influenza does not easily spread between humans so the chances of additional cases in people was low, Dr Looker said.\n\nOn the same day, agricultural authorities revealed a different strain of bird flu had been detected in another part of Victoria at an egg farm. Authorities were alerted after a number of poultry deaths at the farm near Meredith, about 40km northwest of Geelong. Agriculture Victoria has ordered urgent testing after avian influenza was detected at the site.\n\nThat outbreak likely involved the H7N7 strain, not the highly pathogenic H5N1 variant, Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke said. \"There is a type of virus which is causing great concern in the USA and other parts of the world and has behaved unusually in that it has infected dairy cattle and some other marine mammals,' Dr Cooke told the ABC's Country Hour.\n\n\"This is not the strain that we're dealing with. This is a strain that's occurred in Australia before. It's likely not new.\" H7N7 is the most common type of bird flu in Australia and a H7 strain was one of those in the last bird flu outbreak in the country in 2020 which affected a third of egg farms in Victoria.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Neil Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency":

It is not without precedent that we see very occasional reports of the detection of influenza A viruses from birds in severe human cases when there are major underlying health issues. The role of this virus in the fatal outcome cannot be assumed to directly responsible without further investigation. The prompt follow up in healthcare professionals and family members in contact with the infected patient provides reassurance at present this is an isolated case.\"\n\nDr Ed Hutchinson, Senior Lecturer, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (MRC CVR), said:\n\n\"At a time when many people's attention has been focused on H5N1 influenza in cattle in the USA, this case is a reminder that there are lots of other influenza viruses out there that also have the potential to infect humans. However, it is important to stress that at the moment this case was a sad but isolated incident. At the moment there is no suggestion that this particular influenza virus has spread any further in humans.\n\n\"Details of the case are still emerging, but at the moment we know that the virus was an H5N2 influenza virus, making it distinct from the H5N1 influenza viruses that are currently spreading in cattle in the USA and in birds worldwide. Influenza viruses can exchange genes with each other, but whether or not that's happened here will only become clear when viral sequence data are available. For now, we know that there have been recent outbreaks of H5N2 influenza viruses in poultry in Mexico, suggesting that this case may have been related to one of those.\n\n\"Exactly how the person became infected is not yet known, but although there was no record of contact with poultry this sounds like it was most likely a \"spillover\" infection, in which a virus that was adapted to one species of host manages to infect a member of another species (in this case a human), but is not able to transmit any further. It's probably significant that the person in question had multiple underlying health conditions, and had been very unwell for some time before showing signs of this infection. This is likely to have made it easier for a virus that normally grows in birds to infect them, and unfortunately it may also led to them experiencing severe disease when they became unwell. It's not yet clear if the virus had to undergo any particular changes to replicate in this person (something that would definitely be required if it was to spread further in humans). This should become clearer if the virus' genes can be sequenced and compared to other similar viruses.\n\n\"At the moment surveillance is taking place, including testing people who may have been exposed to the virus but fought off the infection to see if they show any signs of an immune response. If there are more human infections with this virus it would become of wider concern, but for now it is a very sad but isolated case.\"\n\nProfessor Ian Jones, Professor of Virology, University of Reading, said:\n\n\"It is impossible to generalise from a single case. However, as H5N2 is present in Mexico and the infected individual had underlying medical conditions, which may have contributed to the outcome, it would be reasonable to suppose this is a one-off case of zoonotic transfer with no potential to spread. This would be consistent with previous examples of occasional avian influenza infections in people. Unless or until there is evidence of strain adaptation or sustained transmission, the risk to the population is very low. The case should act to reinforce the importance of monitoring and eradicating outbreaks in poultry as soon as they occur.\"\n\nDr Ed Hutchinson: I have received honoraria for work in a steering group of the Centre for Open Science (Open Practices in Influenza Research; 2021-2022) and on an advisory board for Seqirus (2022).

This particular strain has not been on the global health radar, prompting questions about the threat it may pose.\n\nAccording to a WHO report, they were alerted to the human infection on May 23. The case involved a 59-year-old man from Mexico with no known contact with poultry or wildlife and who suffered from several other health issues, the Mirror reports.\n\nBefore developing acute avian flu symptoms, he had been bedridden for three weeks. His symptoms, which began on April 17, included \"fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise\". Complications from the illness led to his death on April 24.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor says it's fine to eat chocolate with 'strange spores' as they 'aren't insect eggs'\n\nFollowing the man's death, the WHO conducted an epidemiological investigation of the 17 individuals who had close contact with him. Among them, only one person reported symptoms of a runny nose. This incident follows closely after Australia reported its first human case of a highly pathogenic bird flu strain in a child who became ill after travelling abroad.\n\nA child in Victoria, Australia, contracted the H5N1 strain of bird flu after returning from a trip to India in March. The youngster suffered a \"severe infection\" but has since fully recovered, according to Victoria's chief health officer.\n\n\"This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia,\" Dr Clare Looker announced. She explained that the virus was detected through additional testing of positive influenza samples, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system.\n\nDr Looker also confirmed that no further cases of avian influenza have been identified in connection with this case. She reassured that avian influenza does not easily spread between humans, so the likelihood of more cases is low.\n\nIn related news, agricultural authorities reported a different strain of bird flu at an egg farm in another part of Victoria. The alarm was raised following several poultry deaths at the farm near Meredith, approximately 40km northwest of Geelong. Agriculture Victoria has ordered urgent testing after avian influenza was detected at the site.\n\nChief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke has clarified that the recent outbreak likely involved the H7N7 strain, not the highly pathogenic H5N1 variant. Speaking to ABC's Country Hour, he said: \"There is a type of virus which is causing great concern in the USA and other parts of the world and has behaved unusually in that it has infected dairy cattle and some other marine mammals,' Dr Cooke told the ABC's Country Hour. This is not the strain that we're dealing with. This is a strain that's occurred in Australia before. It's likely not new.\"\n\nThe H7N7 strain is the most common type of bird flu in Australia, and was one of the strains involved in the last bird flu outbreak in 2020, which affected a third of egg farms in Victoria.", "source": {"uri": "gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gloucestershire Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "name":

They say his death was caused by a strain of bird flu never before found in humans - H5N2.\n\nMexican authorities reported an outbreak in the Latin American country's western Michoacan state in March. After it was found in an isolated family unit.\n\nSince then, three nearby outbreaks of H5N2 among poultry have been reported.\n\nWhat We Know\n\n\"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,\" the WHO said Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the WHO, such viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans.\n\nTransmission to humans usually occur via direct contact with either infected animals or contaminated environments.\n\nHuman infections may result in mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis, and encephalopathy. Infections can sometimes be fatal.\n\nViews\n\nConspiracy theories began circulating on X shortly after the news broke from prominent right-wing accounts with large followings.\n\nCharlie Kirk, founder and CEO of conservative organization Turning Point USA, posted: \"Election flu season is officially upon us! Bring it.\"\n\nKirk's post included a screenshot of web search results for news about the Mexican man's death.\n\nConservative podcast host Joey Mannarino said: \"Let me explain something about the bird flu outbreak. I won't vaccinate for it. I won't mask for it. I won't social distance for it. I won't use a \"green pass\" for it. I won't do ANYTHING for it. Go f*** yourselves.\"\n\nToby Rogers, who has more than 60,000 X followers and says he has a Ph.D, posted: \"The dude who supposedly died of bird flu in Mexico had \"chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes\" and \"had no history of exposure to poultry.\" Oh, so basically they made up the bird flu part. Because of course they did.\"\n\n\"BIRD FLU? VACCINE? BS! OPEN YOUR EYES! DO NOT COMPLY,\" an X user called AJ Huber posted. Huber's bio says they are a conservative and MAGA supporter.\n\nJournalist Kyle Becker suggested on X that the WHO was \"baselessly fearmongering\" amid efforts to create a global pandemic treaty.\n\nThe International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response, is a proposed international agreement aimed at strengthening the world's ability to prevent and respond to future pandemics. Negotiations are underway but it is a long way off from being implemented.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting any of the conspiracy theories or rumors circulating online.\n\nBird flu was first discovered in the 1800s and is constantly evolving, like any strain of influenza. Human to human transmission is extremely rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nAt this time the WHO is not advising restrictions such as special traveler screening. They also said the risk to the general population is low and that local health authorities are working to strengthen surveillance activities in poultry and wild birds near the case's proximity.\n\nEarlier in 2024, several people in the U.S. were infected with a strain of bird flu, including two in Michigan and one in Texas.\n\nLast month, two chickens at a live animal market in San Francisco tested positive for bird flu, with traces of the virus being detected in the city's wastewater, according to San Francisco Chronicle reports.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

A 59-year-old Mexico resident was hospitalised in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, it said.\n\nAccording to the statement, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions and relatives reported the case to have been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.\n\nOn 17 April, the individual developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise, according to the UN health agency's statement.\n\nHe sought medical attention on 24 April and was hospitalised at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosio Villegas\" (INER) but died the same day due to complications of his condition, the statement said.\n\nThe same day, results from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus, it said.\n\nThe sample was on 8 May sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2), the statement said.\n\nOn 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A.\n\nTwo days later, on May 22, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2), the statement said.\n\nNo further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation, the agency said.\n\nAffecting the upper respiratory tract, bird flu infections in humans can be mild to severe, sometimes fatal. Symptoms including conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal, have been reported, according to the WHO.\n\nThe viruses responsible for these infections normally spread in animals, but can also infect humans through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, the statement said.

This strain has never been seen in human beings before. It remains unclear how the man might have contracted the virus; however it was found in poultry in Mexico.\n\nThere is a scare among scientists that changes in the virus could make it more transmissible to humans. Though, there is currently minimal threat of avian influenza outbreak in Mexico's population at large.\n\nThe dead man had various health issues and there are no signs that this infection spread from him to others. Despite separate incursions of this flu into neighbouring regions, officials cannot establish their connection.\n\nThis H5N2 strain contrasts with another bird flu variety-H5N1 which infected people in America recently.\n\nAmong them are viruses like H5N2 that affect animals and sometimes pass into humans. It is essential for one to keep watch on such viruses because they can become different and potentially more dangerous to people.\n\nWhat is Avian Influenza A (H5N2)?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\n\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival prospects for some cases.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikhil_pandey@ndtv.com", "name": "Nikhil Pandey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase_inhibitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuraminidase inhibitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_replication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral replication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zanamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oseltamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swine influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encephalitis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-04/c2jel32k_bird-flu_625x300_06_April_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?ver-20240506.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nInfluenza is a broad family of viruses that is divided and subdivided into different types based on a variety of viral properties and can generally cause similar disease. Both H5N2 and H5N1 -- the strain spreading through U.S. cattle and occasionally infecting humans at the moment -- are influenza A viruses, which are known to cause seasonal human epidemics and are the only influenza viruses known to cause pandemics as well. The alphanumeric code of H and N are used to subdivide the viruses further according to what kinds of proteins are on the surface of the virus (H represents the protein hemagglutinin and N represents neuraminidase). H5 influenza primarily affects birds and can cause devastating outbreaks in wild and domestic fowl. The viruses have been known to infect other animals as well, including humans. Human cases of H5N1 are uncommon, but do happen, and Oxford University infectious disease expert Sir Peter Horby said there have been more than 900 human cases reported since 1997. For decades now, experts have widely considered the H5N1 strain to be a pathogen of pandemic potential and outbreaks, especially those that infect humans or mammals, are major public health concerns. Until the infection in Mexico, however, H5N2 was not known as a virus that could infect humans.\n\nAs an isolated case, University of Reading virologist professor Ian Jones said \"it is impossible to generalize.\" There are a great deal of unknowns surrounding the H5N2 case and while certainly concerning, experts have stressed it does not give immediate cause for panic. First of all, the person who died had multiple other health conditions, which means \"the role of this virus... cannot be assumed to be directly responsible (for his death) without further investigation,\" said Professor Iain Brown, of Britain's Pirbright Institute. Additionally, while officials say the source of infection is not yet known, surveillance has yet to turn up indications other humans have been infected and experts say it is still likely a spillover infection from animals. \"If there are more human infections with this virus it would become of wider concern, but for now it is a very sad but isolated case,\" said Ed Hutchinson, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.\n\n\"It would be reasonable to suppose this is a one-off case of zoonotic transfer with no potential to spread,\" said Jones. \"Unless or until there is evidence of strain adaptation or sustained transmission, the risk to the population is very low,\" Jones added. \"The case should act to reinforce the importance of monitoring and eradicating outbreaks in poultry as soon as they occur.\"\n\nAvian influenza, particularly H5N1, is a major concern to health officials. It is feared as the potential source of a future pandemic, devastating to wild and domestic birds, including the food industry, and capable of spreading among mammals. In recent years, cases have been documented in wild birds and, increasingly, livestock. It has been documented in multiple mammal species as well, including sporadic human cases, and experts are concerned the virus could evolve to spread between mammals without the need for close proximity to birds, a key condition for a pandemic to take off. Outbreaks among cattle and dairy farms in the U.S. in recent months have proven particularly concerning. Increasingly, experts are starting to believe the outbreak is more serious than initially thought, particularly with evidence the virus is spreading between cows and from cows to poultry, and have criticized officials' failure to share crucial information and lax testing requirements, which they claim risks outbreaks growing unnoticed. There have been three confirmed cases of H5N1 among dairy farm workers in the U.S., though it's possible other cases have been missed due to a lack of testing and the possibility of asymptomatic or mild infections.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuraminidase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hemagglutinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirbright_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pirbright Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Reading", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Reading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6661c14eef9302339e68394e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1689,x0,y67,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

This announcement, made in the midst of global concerns about avian influenza and its potential impact on public health, is a testament to the robustness of Mexico's health system. Despite the initial alarm, officials have assured the public that there is no identified risk of contagion, emphasizing the comprehensive measures taken to control and investigate the incident.\n\nThe case involves a 59-year-old man from the State of Mexico who had a history of chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and long-term hypertension. On April 24, he sought medical attention at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases' Ismael Cos\u00edo Villegas' (INER) and unfortunately passed away the same day due to complications from his existing health conditions. The initial tests revealed influenza type A, but it wasn't immediately clear which strain he had contracted.\n\nFurther investigation by the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases at the INER and the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) confirmed that the patient had contracted the low-pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N2). This marked the first confirmed human case of this particular virus globally.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Mexican Secretariat of Health (SSa), along with the Secretariats of Agriculture and Rural Development (Sader) and Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat), clarified that no identified source of infection exists and that extensive testing of the patient's contacts yielded negative results.\n\nThe statement highlighted that \"During an exhaustive epidemiological investigation, all samples from identified contacts tested negative.\" Additionally, the SSa has been actively searching for cases of viral respiratory disease and analyzing data to detect any changes in the trends of respiratory illnesses in Mexico City and the State of Mexico.\n\nAvian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has a storied history in global public health. The first significant outbreak among humans occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, involving the H5N1 strain, which led to extensive culling of poultry to prevent a pandemic. Over the years, various strains of avian influenza have emerged, causing sporadic infections and fatalities among humans, usually those in direct contact with infected birds.\n\nLatin America has not been a significant hotspot for avian influenza compared to other regions, but the recent detection of H5N2 in Mexico highlights the interconnected nature of global health threats. The region's response to such incidents is crucial, given the potential for rapid disease spread in today's globalized world.\n\nIn response to the detection, Semarnat conducted biological sampling and monitoring of wild and synanthropic birds in the Tl\u00e1huac-Xico wetlands and surrounding areas near the patient's residence. This was done in coordination with the National Service for Health, Safety, and Agri-Food Quality (Senasica) to establish a continuous monitoring system for the timely detection of similar cases in wildlife.\n\nThe Mexican government, recognizing the importance of global solidarity in health crises, has actively communicated with international bodies. Operating under agreements like the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI), this collaboration ensures that Mexico's response is not only effective but also aligned with global standards and practices for managing and mitigating the spread of avian influenza. This international cooperation is a beacon of hope in the face of global health threats.\n\nThe Mexican-American Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA) has implemented active epidemiological surveillance in backyard poultry areas. This measure, aimed at identifying potential bird cases related to human cases, underscores the crucial role that the public plays in managing health crises. Despite these measures, Mexican health authorities have reassured the public that the risk posed by this virus to the general population is low, empowering individuals to take control of their health.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also considers the public health risk from this virus to be minimal. Consequently, consuming well-cooked chicken or eggs is deemed safe and does not pose a health threat to humans.\n\nThe detection of H5N2 in Mexico reminds us of the region's vulnerability to zoonotic diseases and the importance of robust public health systems. Latin America has faced numerous public health challenges, from dengue fever and Zika virus outbreaks to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These incidents have underscored the need for solid health infrastructure, rapid response mechanisms, and international cooperation.\n\nMexico's response to this avian influenza case reflects a proactive approach that combines local expertise with global best practices. It also highlights the importance of transparency and timely information dissemination in managing public health crises.\n\nHistorically, Latin America has dealt with various infectious diseases, often with limited resources. The response to the H5N2 case is informed by past experiences with diseases like H1N1 influenza, which significantly impacted the region in 2009. The lessons learned from these experiences have shaped current public health strategies, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and rapid response.\n\nThe region's health authorities have become adept at mobilizing resources quickly and coordinating with international partners to contain outbreaks. This capability is crucial in a global health landscape where diseases can cross borders rapidly, necessitating a collective effort to safeguard public health.\n\nConfirming the first human case of low-pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N2) in Mexico is critical in the country's public health narrative. While the initial shock of the news has been tempered by assurances from health authorities about the low risk of contagion, the incident underscores the importance of vigilance and preparedness in the face of emerging health threats.\n\nMexico's comprehensive response, which includes extensive epidemiological investigations, international cooperation, and public reassurance, not only sets a benchmark for handling such cases but also underscores the interconnected nature of global health and the need for robust systems to detect, manage, and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases.\n\nMexico's Economic Challenges Under New President Claudia Sheinbaum\n\nAs Latin America continues to navigate its complex public health landscape, the lessons learned from this case will be invaluable in strengthening regional health systems and ensuring a swift and effective response to future health challenges. The commitment to transparency, thorough investigation, and international collaboration will be vital to protecting public health and preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases.", "source": {"uri": "latinamericanpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "latinamericanpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_of_Health_(Mexico)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretariat of Health (Mexico)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexican Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foot-and-mouth disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wetland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Epidemiology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Epidemiology", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Policy_and_Regulation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Policy and Regulation", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://latinamericanpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240606_Mexicos-First-Human-Case-of-Avian-Flu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628348", "eventUri": "eng-9628348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 957, "textEnd": 965}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

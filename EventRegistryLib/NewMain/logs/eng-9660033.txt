The candidates also discussed inflation, the budget deficit, Iran's housing problem and ways to fight corruption.\n\nThe June 28 election comes at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear programme, its arming of Russia in that country's war on Ukraine and its wide-reaching crackdowns on dissent.\n\nIran's support of militia proxy forces throughout the wider Middle East, meanwhile, have, been increasingly in the spotlight as Iran-backed Yemen's Houthi rebels attack ships in the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFive of the candidates are hard-liners while the sixth candidate, lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has the support of some pro-reformers.\n\nThe most prominent candidate remains Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, 62, a former Tehran mayor with close ties to the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. However, many remember that Qalibaf, as a former Guard general, was part of a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nAmong those running for president are also Iran's vice-president, Amir Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, 53, and the current Tehran mayor, Ali Reza Zakani 58. A member of Supreme National Security Council, 58-year-old Saeed Jalili and cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, 64, a previous interior minister under former relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani, are also in the race.\n\nQalibaf promised he would be a \"strong\" president who would support the poor, better manage the economy and effort to remove sanctions through diplomatic means.\n\nPezeshkian said the sanctions were a \"disaster\" and also lobbied for less restrictions on the internet. Iran has long blocked Facebook, X, Instagram, Telegram and other major social media platforms and messaging systems, mainly over security concerns\n\nAll the candidates pledged to strengthen the country's currency, the rial, which has plunged to 580,000 against the dollar. The rial was 32,000 to the dollar when Iran and world powers reached a deal with world powers in 2015 on capping Tehran's nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions.\n\nThe six stayed away from the topic of the tattered nuclear deal. Khamenei has final say on all major state matters, including nuclear, foreign policy, space and military programs.\n\nPro-reform figures such as former President Mohammad Khatami and former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal have backed Pezeshkian, though votes in his favour in his parliamentary constituency in the northwestern city of Tabriz declined from 36 per cent to 24 per cent of the vote in elections over the past eight years.\n\nRaisi won Iran's 2021 presidential election in a vote that saw the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republic's history.

He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country\u00b4s police chief.\n\nAmong those running for president are also Iran's vice-president, Amir Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, 53, and the current Tehran mayor, Ali Reza Zakani 58. A member of Supreme National Security Council, 58-year-old Saeed Jalili and cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, 64, a previous interior minister under former relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani, are also in the race.\n\nQalibaf promised he would be a \"strong\" president who would support the poor, better manage the economy and effort to remove sanctions through diplomatic means.\n\nPezeshkian said the sanctions were a \"disaster\" and also lobbied for less restrictions on the internet. Iran has long blocked Facebook, X, Instagram, Telegram and other major social media platforms and messaging systems, mainly over security concerns\n\nAll the candidates pledged to strengthen the country's currency, the rial, which has plunged to 580,000 against the dollar. The rial was 32,000 to the dollar when Iran and world powers reached a deal with world powers in 2015 on capping Tehran\u00b4s nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions.\n\nThe six stayed away from the topic of the tattered nuclear deal. Khamenei has final say on all major state matters, including nuclear, foreign policy, space and military programs.\n\nPro-reform figures such as former President Mohammad Khatami and former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal have backed Pezeshkian, though votes in his favor in his parliamentary constituency in the northwestern city of Tabriz declined from 36% to 24% of the vote in elections over the past eight years.\n\nRaisi won Iran's 2021 presidential election in a vote that saw the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republic\u00b4s history.\n\nIn this picture made available by Iranian state TV IRIB, presidential candidates for June 28 election from left to right; Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Masoud Pezeshkian, Saeed Jalili, Alireza Zakani, and Mostafa Pourmohammadi listen to the country's national anthem at the start of their debate at a state-run TV studio in Tehran, Iran, Monday, June 17, 2024.

They all promised to try to get the sanctions lifted and to introduce reforms, but none offered concrete details.\n\n\"Negotiation is a method of struggle,\" said prominent candidate Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, 62, with regards to getting the Western sanctions on Iran lifted. Qalibaf is a former Tehran mayor with close ties to the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\nHe emphasized the destructiveness of the sanctions on the economy and said that Iranians have a right to a good life, not just an ordinary life.\n\nIran's vice president, Amir Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, 53, said he will continue Raisi's unfinished administration and vowed to develop the tourism industry.\n\nRegarding the health sector and the emigration of doctors and nurses abroad, Qalibaf said there should be a fundamental change in the way health workers are paid to increase the motivation to stay.\n\nMany doctors and nurses reportedly have left Iran in recent years over its deepening economic woes and poor working conditions. Qalibaf's call for more pay for health workers was repeated by the other candidates.\n\nAll the candidates said they believe the Education Ministry is the most important part of the government because \"the next generation of the country is raised in this ministry.\" Qalibaf said the ministry's budget must be increased.\n\nThe one pro-reform candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, who is backed by pro-reform figures such as former President Mohammad Khatami and former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, thinks the economic crisis can be resolved by solving party differences inside the country as well as external factors.\n\nThe June 28 election comes at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, its arming of Russia in that country's war on Ukraine and its wide-reaching crackdowns on dissent.\n\nIran's support of militia proxy forces throughout the wider Middle East, meanwhile, has been increasingly in the spotlight as Iran-backed Yemen's Houthi rebels attack ships in the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I believe that with the affection and logic that exists between revolutionaries, this will eventually happen,\" Qalibaf said when asked if there was any chance, he would withdraw in favor of a fellow conservative.\n\nAnalysts warn that conservative candidates face a significant challenge from the sole reformist hopeful, Masoud Pezeshkian, unless they consolidate their support. They believe that Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, the two frontrunners among conservatives, must reach an agreement, with one withdrawing in favor of the other, to avoid splitting the conservative vote. This consolidation, according to analysts, is crucial to prevent a potential victory by Pezeshkian.\n\nQalibaf vows to \"truly\" terminate sanctions\n\nDuring a political roundtable, Qalibaf's advisor sitting next to him said that the candidate's administration would be focused on getting rid of anti-Iran U.S. sanctions for good.\n\n\"Negotiations to terminate the sanctions will be a priority in Qalibaf's government. It is important to ensure that the sanctions are fully terminated and their impact is verified, not just on paper. As part of the negotiations, we will aim to restore oil sales, banking operations, and foreign trade in exchange for nuclear commitments,\" said Kazem Gharibabadi, the Secretary General of Iran's High Council for Human Rights.\n\nIn separate remarks, Qalibaf stated that \"effective governance in foreign policy is about managing relationships to maximize benefits and minimize costs for Iran.\"\n\nHe also emphasizes the importance of strengthening bilateral financial relations and leveraging Iran's geographical location for economic management.\n\n\"A strong and informed manager is needed to utilize Iran's geopolitical capacity effectively. Foreign policy and diplomacy will be my key priorities,\" the parliament speaker said.\n\nPezeshkian distances himself from extremists\n\nDuring a gathering at the University of Tehran, Pezeshkian stated that he is a staunch supporter of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, and while criticism is allowed, no one has the right to insult the figures he very dearly believes in.\n\n\"Students have the right to protest when there is something they see unfair. But protesting is different from rioting,\" he commented.\n\n'Candidates should observe Islamic ethics'\n\nBefore their first presidential debate on Monday, all six Iranian candidates met with the Chairman of Iran's Assembly of Experts, Ayatollah Mohammad-Ali Movahedi Kermani.\n\nIn their discussions, Ayatollah Kermani emphasized the importance of good conduct and assertiveness during the upcoming presidential debates. He also advised the candidates to maintain their composure and refrain from attacking their opponents in an unethical manner.\n\n\"In the debates, people should see integrity, dignity, and seriousness in you.

The Guardian Council oversees qualifying candidates and has approved six figures, with five belonging to the fundamentalist political faction and one representative of the opposing group known as the \"Reformists.\"\n\nSpeaking on state television on June 16, he highlighted his record in executive positions, saying he is more prepared than other candidates to advance the agenda.\n\nHe said the revolutionary front \"must agree on one person before June 28\", implying that the other fundamentalist nominees were selected as placeholders.\n\n\"This rationality, this sacrifice and this kindness certainly exists in the revolution front, and this will surely happen,\" he said in remarks that sounded like a request.\n\nQalibaf is a leading candidate among the conservatives, who also call themselves the \"Revolutionary Front\", referring to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He has attempted to gain the presidency several times before, but each time was rebuffed by the voting public.\n\nThis is while Saeed Jalili, Qalibaf's key rival in the faction, has shown no such intention.\n\nReports had already circulated in Iranian media about the two candidates' pressure on each other to withdraw, with neither one giving in.\n\nMahmoud Nabavian, a member of Jalili's campaign team, had said earlier that the candidate's prospective withdrawal is an \"electoral lie\".\n\nHe has even implicitly accused Qalibaf of being a \"contractor\" rather than an executive manager suited for the president's office.\n\nIf what Qalibaf predicted happens, the final presidential competition will be between two candidates from each political front, potentially Qalibaf and Masoud Pezeshkian from the reformists.\n\nQalibaf was a commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, chief of police and mayor of Tehran before finally grabbing the position of parliament speaker.\n\nHe has already run for president three times, losing twice and withdrawing once in favour of Raisi.\n\nIn the present presidential race, he has repeatedly stated that he would go along the course of Raisi and has made zero indication that he could help the younger generations, who overwhelmingly distrust the ageing Islamic Republic.\n\nQalibaf has a poor reputation for his crackdown on student protests during his term as chief of police and faces criticism about suing journalists as well as several cooperation cases and probes on those surrounding him, including family members.\n\nHis name is also linked to reports in 2022 about his wife and children purchasing a luxury house in Turkey and buying expensive brand new-born essentials for his grandchild in Turkish

Mr Raisi has been seen as a successor to the cleric.\n\nIran's Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, 62, is the most prominent candidate.\n\nA former mayor of Tehran and commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, he promised that the removal of sanctions through diplomatic efforts would be his top priority.\n\nHe also vowed to be a supporter of the poor and to ensure economic growth by managing the economy efficiently and tackling inflation.\n\nMr Qalibaf said that with \"strong management\" and \"a strong president,\" inflation could be brought under control, according to state-run Irna news agency.\n\nMr Qalibaf, 62, has run unsuccessfully in previous presidential elections. In 2017, he pulled out of the contest to avoid splitting the vote against Mr Raisi.\n\nHe is part of a circle of conservatives appointed and promoted by the supreme leader.\n\nCurrently Iran's Vice President, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi stood in the 2021 presidential election, finishing fourth.\n\nMr Ghazizadeh Hashemi, 53, used the debate as an opportunity to showcase the achievements of the government under Mr Raisi, which he was a part of.\n\n\"People are fed up with promises,\" he said, adding that the president should introduce economics roadmaps and how they are intended to be carried out to the people.\n\nHardliner and current Mayor of Tehran, Alireza Zakani, 58, said that while US and Western sanctions were crippling the economy, the country's currency - the rial - needed to be strengthened.\n\nHe argued that economic independence needs to be achieved by stabilising the economy and ensuring that Iranians rely on the national currency.\n\n\"If we want people to stand for the revolution, we must make the people participate in the economy,\" Mr Zakani said, adding that the private sector should be at the helm of the economy and stressing the importance of the participation of the population.\n\nA member of the Supreme National Security Council and a former nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, 58, touched upon the importance of investment in achieving economic growth.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of the government allocating resources for \"national talent\" and that investing in people will ultimately improve the economy.\n\nDespite his experience with nuclear negotiations, Mr Jalili - like the other candidates - did not touch upon the issue.\n\nMr Pourmohammadi, 64, has served in different ministerial positions - the most recent one being justice minister in 2013.\n\nHe also served as prosecutor of the revolutionary court.\n\nHe said work needed to be put into \"national reconciliation\" to gain people's trust and that economic issues should not be separated from social ones.\n\nHe added that sanctions were obstructing international trade, stating that Iran's ties to other countries were \"locked.\"\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, 69, is the only reformist in the race but it remains to be seen whether he can gain the support of undecided voters.\n\nHe called for more openness towards other countries to achieve economic growth.\n\nHe remains the favourite of pro-reformists and critics say conservatives may seek to discredit him.\n\nProminent disqualified figures include former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and veteran politician Ali Larijani, who were both previously barred from the 2021 election.\n\nSeveral members of former president Hassan Rouhani's administration, including his vice president Eshagh Jahangiri, also had their candidacy rejected by the Guardian Council.\n\nAll six candidates promised a better economic outlook for the country without offering any specifics on how this would be achieved.\n\nFour more debates will take place, with the last one set for June 25 - three days before Iranians head to the polls.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"},

Late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was on a helicopter ride to this city when the aircraft carrying him crashed and took his life.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zakani visited the father of Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Ale-Hashem, the Friday prayer imam of Tabriz who perished during the same chopper crash as President Raisi.\n\n\"The people of Tabriz and Azerbaijan have always played an important role in shaping Iran's history, and this has been particularly evident during the past few decades. The people of Tabriz have been the flagbearers in Iran's fight towards independence, freedom, progress, and development. My message to them is to actively participate in the elections and vote for a candidate who has precise plans for the country's future,\" he said during the meeting.\n\nQalibaf reunites with late comrade in Kerman\n\nMohammad Baqer Qalibaf who spent several years as a senior commander in the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, visited the tomb of Iran's anti-terror icon and commander of the IRGC Quds force Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani in his southeastern hometown of Kerman.\n\nIn a gathering with his Kermani supporters, Qalibaf hailed the people of the city and the province for their unyielding support towards the Islamic Revolution and undying resistance against hardships.\n\nQalibaf pledged that if chosen as the next Iranian president, he would prioritize helping the less fortunate in the country's population. Kerman is believed to be among the Iranian provinces with the highest rates of poverty.\n\n\"Each one of our people is those who, through careful consideration, make the right choice; if success is found, I pledge and covenant with the people of Iran that I will prioritize all social strata, especially those below the poverty line, retirees, villagers, workers, and those with fixed incomes,\" Qalibaf expressed.\n\nZarif tags along with Pezeshkian to Esfahan\n\nThe reformists' only hope for the presidency, Masoud Pezeshkian, chose the central city of Esfahan as his destination on Wednesday.\n\nFormer Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also accompanied the candidate throughout the trip, after first appearing beside him on a televised roundtable.\n\nZarif also posted a notice on his X account recently, announcing that he and a number of other prominent reformists are backing Pezeshkian in the 2024 presidential elections.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com",

The approach has over the past three years been promoted by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and was closely pursued by late President Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a helicopter crash in May triggered the snap polls.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Hossein_Ghazizadeh_Hashemi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alireza_Zakani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alireza Zakani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2024-06/GettyImages-2157219783%20copy.jpeg?h=a5ae579a&itok=S23aoP0-", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660033", "eventUri": "eng-9660033", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 211, "textEnd": 218}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

They all promised to try to get the sanctions lifted and to introduce reforms, but none offered concrete details.\n\n\"Negotiation is a method of struggle,\" said prominent candidate Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, 62, with regards to getting the Western sanctions on Iran lifted. Qalibaf is a former Tehran mayor with close ties to the country\u00b4s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\nHe emphasized the destructiveness of the sanctions on the economy and said that Iranians have a right to a good life, not just an ordinary life.\n\nIn this picture made available by Iranian state-run TV, IRIB, reformist presidential candidate for June 28, election Masoud Pezeshkian shows a graph of Iranians calorie consumption per capita in a debate of the candidates at the TV studio in Tehran, Iran, Thursday, June 20, 2024. (Morteza Fakhri Nezhad/IRIB via AP)\n\nIran\u00b4s vice president, Amir Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, 53, said he will continue Raisi\u00b4s unfinished administration and vowed to develop the tourism industry.\n\nRegarding the health sector and the emigration of doctors and nurses abroad, Qalibaf said there should be a fundamental change in the way health workers are paid to increase the motivation to stay.\n\nMany doctors and nurses reportedly have left Iran in recent years over its deepening economic woes and poor working conditions. Qalibaf's call for more pay for health workers was repeated by the other candidates.\n\nAll the candidates said they believe the Education Ministry is the most important part of the government because \"the next generation of the country is raised in this ministry.\" Qalibaf said the ministry's budget must be increased.\n\nThe one pro-reform candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, who is backed by pro-reform figures such as former President Mohammad Khatami and former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, thinks the economic crisis can be resolved by solving party differences inside the country as well as external factors.\n\nThe June 28 election comes at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran\u00b4s rapidly advancing nuclear program, its arming of Russia in that country\u00b4s war on Ukraine and its wide-reaching crackdowns on dissent.\n\nIran\u00b4s support of militia proxy forces throughout the wider Middle East, meanwhile, has been increasingly in the spotlight as Iran-backed Yemen\u00b4s Houthi rebels attack ships in the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn this picture made available by Iranian state-run TV, IRIB, reformist presidential candidate for June 28, election Masoud Pezeshkian speaks in a debate of the candidates at the TV studio in Tehran, Iran, Thursday, June 20, 2024.

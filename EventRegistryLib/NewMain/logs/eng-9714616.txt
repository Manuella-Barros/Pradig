Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nCrown attorney Alexandra Berg said the prosecutor is on the cusp of providing the first wave of disclosure, outlining the allegations against Stronach to his defence team, with another tranche of evidentiary details to follow shortly after.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Star Exclusive 'He was my abductor and rapist, and I feared for my life': Alleged Frank Stronach victim tells her story\n\nComplainant says she tried going to Toronto police force nearly a decade ago. Billionaire\n\nBerg said \"the first wave of disclosure, which was comprehensive\" and included video statements, officer notes and surveillance linked to the first three complainants, has been received and reviewed by the Crown's office and \"it will be disclosed to counsel imminently.\"\n\nShe said the second wave of disclosure, which related to the more recent complainants, was received very recently. The Crown is \"in the process of readying that for disclosure as well,\" Berg said while appearing for the provincial Crown via Zoom video.\n\nThe case, which was heard before a justice of the peace inside assignment court in Brampton, was adjourned until Oct. 7, when defence and Crown counsel are expected to take next steps.\n\nA gaggle of media converged outside the courthouse in anticipation of an appearance by Stronach, 91, who faces a total of 13 criminal charges, including sexual assault and historical charges of attempted rape and indecent assault on a female. Peel Regional Police announced the first of the charges a month ago, then added additional counts weeks later.\n\nStronach's lawyer, Brian Greenspan, has said his client \"categorically\" denies the allegations against him and will \"vigorously\" defend himself against the charges. None of the allegations have been tested in court.\n\nCourt documents allege the assaults happened as far back as 1977 and as recently as February, and involve 10 alleged victims.\n\nAs first reported by the Star, one of Stronach's accusers -- who alleges the businessman sexually assaulted her in 1980 -- says she went to Toronto police in 2015 to report the alleged crimes but never heard back.\n\nIt would take years charges to be laid in her case. Last month, Peel police charged Stronach with rape and indecent assault on a female stemming from her allegations.\n\nAsked what Toronto police did after receiving the woman's report about Stronach, a spokesperson said the force could not comment on matters before the courts.\n\n\"This could have been stopped before any more harm came,\" the woman told the Star in an exclusive interview last week.\n\nThe 1980 complainant alleges Stronach sexually assaulted her on a July 1980 night, which began when she met friends to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday at Rooney's, the now-shuttered Toronto restaurant and bar owned by Stronach. She said Stronach sexually assaulted her on the dance floor and in a booth, then raped her at a second location, near the Toronto waterfront.\n\nIn response to the Star's questions about the woman's account, Greenspan last week reiterated Stronach's denial of the \"untested\" allegations against him and said: \"We ask that the public respect the fundamental precept that Mr. Stronach remains innocent of any wrongdoing and that he will respond to these allegations in a fair and public court of law.\"\n\nPeel police initially announced they had charged Stronach with five offences: rape, indecent assault on a female, two charges of sexual assault and forcible confinement. Court documents state those offences involve three victims, and are alleged to have happened in 1980, 1986 and 2023.\n\nPolice appealed to members of the public to come forward if they had any relevant information or may also be victims.\n\nStronach was charged with several additional counts on June 26, including six charges of sexual assault and two historical charges of attempted rape and indecent assault on a female.\n\nOf the new charges, two are offences that no longer exist in the criminal code: attempted rape and indecent assault on a female. Police investigating historical incidents can lay criminal charges according to the law at the time of the alleged offence.\n\nStronach, one of Canada's best-known business figures, is the founder of Aurora-based auto parts manufacturer Magna International and a member of the Order of Canada.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Magna International said Stronach has had no affiliation with Magna for more than a decade.\n\n\"The initial and growing criminal charges against Mr. Stronach by the Peel Regional Police are alarming and deeply disturbing because the alleged actions completely contradict Magna's core values and beliefs,\" said Tracy Fuerst. \"We hold all, no matter their status inside or outside the company, to the highest standards and are steadfast in our commitment to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected, valued, and protected.\"\n\nStronach was previously released on the condition that he surrender his passport, not change his address and not try to contact any of his accusers. He appeared at a Peel police station last week, likely to be fingerprinted, as part of the ongoing investigation. He arrived with personal security who attempted to obscure him from onlookers.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Belinda Stronach is the chairman, chief executive officer and president of the Stronach Group, a collection of entities and businesses - most notably involving racing and gambling - that is owned by a network of Stronach family trusts.\n\nSelena Stronach and her father, Andrew Stronach, filed lawsuits in 2019 alleging that Frank Stronach's fortune has not been distributed evenly among his heirs. In this latest filing, his granddaughter has argued that any settlement payments linked to Frank Stronach's alleged sexual impropriety are relevant to her claim.\n\nSexual assault trial of Frank Stronach adjourned for three months\n\nThrough her lawyer, Belinda Stronach said she will be opposing the disclosure request. In her statement, she also addressed the criminal charges that were laid against her father in June.\n\n\"The allegations against my father are deeply disturbing. As that matter is before the courts, I cannot comment further,\" Ms. Stronach said.\n\nFrank Stronach, the 91-year-old founder of Magna International MG-T, faces 13 charges including rape, forcible confinement, indecent assault and sexual assault. The incidents involve 10 complainants and span years from the late 1970s through to 2024.\n\nMr. Stronach has denied the criminal accusations. In a statement from his lawyer, Brian Greenspan, Mr. Stronach has urged the public to respect the legal principle of the presumption of innocence. \"He will respond to these allegations in a fair and public court of law.\"\n\nSelena Stronach is being represented by Lax O'Sullivan Lisus Gottlieb.\n\nIn the weeks after Mr. Stronach's arrest, further allegations against the Magna founder have been reported, including a first-person account published in The Globe and Mail by author Jane Boon, who described having sex with Mr. Stronach when she was a 19-year-old student working at Magna and he was 54. The incident took place at Magna's corporate guest house, she wrote.\n\nMs. Boon's piece is cited in Selena Stronach's application.\n\n\"The media coverage includes an account of Mr. Stronach using corporate resources and settings to engage in alleged predatory sexual conduct,\" reads the latest motion, which has not been tested in court. \"It is likely that records exist which reveal a pattern of misconduct by Mr. Stronach that includes corporate knowledge and, potentially, facilitation and cover-up.\"\n\nBorn in Austria, Mr. Stronach founded Magna International in 1957 and grew the business into one of the world's largest auto parts suppliers. Mr. Stronach resigned as Magna's chairman in 2011 to take an ultimately unsuccessful run at politics in Austria. Around the same time, the Stronach family divested its controlling stake in Magna. At that point, much of Mr. Stronach's vast wealth - which in 2018 was estimated to be US$1.5-billion by Forbes magazines - was funnelled into the Stronach Group.\n\nFrank Stronach's alleged sexual-assault charges raise questions for institutions bearing his name\n\nIn 2016, the Stronach Group announced Belinda Stronach as chair. Five years later, she was formally announced as the group's CEO and president. (The previous CEO, Alon Ossip, who is also a defendant in Selena Stronach's lawsuit, had been on a leave of absence since January, 2017.)\n\nThe latest court motion, which was filed with the court earlier this week, includes correspondence between Marie Henein - who is representing Andrew Stronach in his litigation - and lawyers for Belinda Stronach and Mr. Ossip. Ms. Henein wrote to the lawyers after Frank Stronach was first charged, questioning whether the parties had met their disclosure obligations.\n\n\"A question at the trial will be, what did Mr. Ossip, Ms. Stronach, and their leadership team know about the allegations against Frank Stronach and his underlying conduct,\" she wrote. \"Further, information will have to be disclosed about any payments that were made by any of the Stronach entities as a result of these allegations. Who was involved in or had knowledge of such payments will have to be disclosed.\"\n\nMr. Ossip's lawyer, Mark Gelowitz, replied that the issues raised by Ms. Henein are not relevant to the litigation.\n\nThe motion materials include an affidavit signed by Andrew Stronach, which states that he only had knowledge of one allegation of sexual misconduct against his father before last month. Andrew Stronach says that, when his father was the chair of Magna, he was told by a then-senior executive within the company, Keith Stein, that a woman had alleged she was sexually harassed by his father. The affidavit provides no information about that alleged incident, including the timing.\n\nMr. Stein did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2002, Frank Stronach was sued for wrongful dismissal by Nicole Will, who was a 21-year-old bartender at the Magna Golf Club. Ms. Will alleged she had to rebuff Mr. Stronach's efforts to get her to play tennis with him and obtain her phone number, advances that she says ultimately led to her resignation. Mr. Stronach denied inflicting mental distress on Ms. Will. The two reached a confidential out-of-court settlement.\n\nIn response to questions from The Globe, Tracy Fuerst, a vice-president of corporate communications at Magna, did not address questions about potential settlements involving the auto parts supplier. She said the company has no knowledge of the allegations related to the Stronach Group.\n\n\"All that we can add is that it has been more than a decade since Mr. Stronach held a position of ownership or executive control at Magna,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_Stronach", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belinda Stronach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stronach", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Stronach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronach_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stronach Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Superior_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Superior Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magna International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_magnate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business magnate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greenspan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Greenspan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Globe and Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presumption of innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Henein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marie Henein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/EHR5I5GYYRAW5BMGK7R3FXXU4Y.JPG?auth=6fcfa0ad1e84a852d5488b84e2c4691902c0047b8a8b4bcb1991423a2def8b09&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714616", "eventUri": "eng-9714616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-01-", "textStart": 3916, "textEnd": 3929}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The charges include rape, sexual assault and forcible confinement for incidents alleged to have occurred in the Toronto area between 1977 and 2024.\n\nJudge Karen Murphy of Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton, Ont., scheduled Oct. 7 as the next court date and imposed a publication ban on the names of the complainants.\n\nDefence lawyer Christopher Lutes, who addressed the judge on a video link, sought the adjournment because he said Mr. Stronach's team is awaiting full disclosure of the Crown's case.\n\nCrown Attorney Alexandra Berg, in the five-minute proceeding, told the court the prosecution's evidence includes video statements and surveillance tape.\n\nIn a statement last Friday, Mr. Stronach's lawyer Brian Greenspan said, \"We ask that the public respect the fundamental precept that Mr. Stronach remains innocent of any wrongdoing and that he will respond to these allegations in a fair and public court of law.\"\n\nMr. Stronach has had to surrender his passport and is forbidden to have any contact with the alleged victims, or go anywhere he might encounter them.\n\nBorn in Austria, Mr. Stronach founded car parts maker Magna International in Toronto in 1957. The company became one of the world's largest auto parts makers, and today employs 179,000 people in 28 countries.\n\nMr. Stronach stepped down as chairman of Magna in 2011 and retired as a director in 2012.

He arrived with personal security who attempted to obscure him from onlookers.\n\nPeel police initially announced they had charged Stronach with five offences: rape, indecent assault on a female, two charges of sexual assault and forcible confinement. Court documents state those offences involve three victims, and are alleged to have happened in 1980, 1986 and 2023.\n\nAt the time, police appealed to members of the public to come forward if they had any relevant information or may also be victims.\n\nStronach was charged with several additional counts on June 26, including six charges of sexual assault and two historical charges of attempted rape and indecent assault on a female.\n\nOf the new charges, two are offences that no longer exist in the criminal code: attempted rape and indecent assault on a female. Police investigating historical incidents can lay criminal charges according to the law at the time of the alleged offence.\n\nStronach, the founder of Aurora-based auto parts manufacturer Magna International and member of the Order of Canada, was previously released on the condition that he surrender his passport, not change his address and not try to contact any of his accusers.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wendy_gillis@thestar.com", "name": "Wendy Gillis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jason_miller@thestar.com", "name": "Jason Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stronach", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Stronach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indecent assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Regional_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peel Regional Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Peel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regional Municipality of Peel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Regional Municipality of Peel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aurora, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aurora, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greenspan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Greenspan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal Code (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magna International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/0a/00a13fce-3afc-11ef-a55b-93a294825a03/6663ae67b4a4c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714616", "eventUri": "eng-9714616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1788, "textEnd": 1795}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Jane Boon reflects on her encounter, at age 19, with auto magnate Frank Stronach, who has been charged with 13 sex crimes - more on that below, along with Boeing's plea deal and blistering bi-coastal heat. But first:\n\nThe sexual assault trial of billionaire businessman Frank Stronach has been adjourned until Oct. 7, after a brief proceeding at a Brampton, Ont., courtoom yesterday morning. Stronach, the founder of auto parts manufacturer Magna International, did not appear in person or on video, and the judge imposed a publication ban on the names of the 10 complainants. In June, Stronach was arrested and charged with 13 sex crimes, including rape, sexual assault and forcible confinement, in allegations that stretch from 1977 to 2024.\n\nRecently, novelist Jane Boon wrote in The Globe about an encounter she had with Stronach nearly four decades ago, when she was a 19-year-old student on a prestigious Magna scholarship. Stronach, then 54, had taken an interest in Boon, first at her school's end-of-term meetings, where she was singled out for encouragement, then on a visit to the company's headquarters, where they spoke for half an hour in his office, and, finally, at a shareholder meeting in 1986.\n\nStronach invited Boon to the afterparty held at his Toronto restaurant, Rooney's. At the end of the night, she says, Stronach told his driver she'd had too much to drink and to fetch Boon's hatchback - Stronach would take her back to his guest house in Markham himself. They had sex, and while she is not one of the complainants, Boon has wrestled with the meaning of that evening ever since. This week, she spoke with The Decibel about their encounter; here is some of what she said on the podcast.\n\nOn being seated with Stronach at the afterparty:\n\n\"I was so excited, so jazzed, and kind of disbelieving - why is this happening to me, of all people? But gosh darn it, I am here for the night. The owner's table was the hot table. And you know, people were drifting by. I was sitting adjacent to Stronach. Bill Davis, who had been the Premier of Ontario but was then a board member at Magna, sat with us for a while. I mean, it was pretty heady stuff for a 19 year old. And so I hardly said a word. I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I didn't want to embarrass my host.\"\n\nOn Stronach's repeated invitations to his guest house:\n\n\"Halfway through the evening, Stronach turned to one of his assistants. There were a couple of women sitting at the table who worked for Stronach. By this time, he understood that I was working at one of their divisions in Guelph, so I was about an hour away from home. And he asked her if the guest house was available that night because he didn't want me driving back to Guelph. It was right in front of me, it was right in front of her, it was right in front of the table. I mean, anybody who was listening would have heard this. And she goes, 'Oh, it's available, Mr. Stronach. Jane could stay there.' And then she turned to me, and she's like, 'Oh, this is great. It's a wonderful house, it'd be very comfortable.' And I was like, I'm fine. I didn't want to be the kind of girl that needed that kind of help. I mean, I was very self-sufficient. And so I declined. The offer was made again. And I declined again. There was the sense of, like, is this dodgy? I knew it was, like, kind of weird. But he had said this to his assistant, a woman who presumably would know if it was dodgy. And she was telling me it was safe.\"\n\nOn having sex with Stronach:\n\n\"The issues of consent were murky. I never said no, I never said yes, I was just: Let's get this over with. But it was all in my head. So what is that? It's not correct. I think we can all agree that 54-year-old CEOs should not be hitting on 19-year-old students in their employ. They should not be taking them in a car, half an hour north of Toronto, to an isolated home. They should not be having sex with them. And that, I think, is inarguable. It was wrong. He should have known better. And he put me in an awful position. There was no easy way to extract myself. There was no easy way to say no.\"\n\nOn coming forward now:\n\n\"One of the things that I've seen with women who make serious allegations against powerful men is that anonymity may empower them, but it also means that they're viewed as less credible by people. I don't have a legal case against him, I don't think, but the facts of my situation are so appalling that attaching a face and a name to a story of abuse of power - and let's face it, it was exploitive and coercive - might be helpful to those other women, so that they know that what happened to them didn't just happen to them, and that they should feel more comfortable coming forward, if that's what they want to do.\"\n\nOn her sense of the system that surrounds Stronach:\n\n\"He couldn't have done this with me if he didn't have access to that guest house, if he didn't have a room full of colleagues willing to look the other way while he sat with a 19 year old, if he didn't have a driver who could take my car. ... He was adept at creating systems to manufacture parts. But that effectiveness at creating systems to make parts also was used to, in my opinion, identify women, and then to get them alone. And it's a travesty that it was allowed to go on for as long as it was, and that the consequences to these other ladies were so dire. I mean, I wasn't a victim of sexual violence, thank goodness. But there are 10 women who say they were.\"\n\nAt least 36 people were killed in a Russian missile barrage that hit Ukraine's largest children's hospital.

Disclosure information is available on the original site.\n\n___\n\nAuthor: Ena Chadha, Adjunct Professor York University Schulich School of Buisness / Chair of the Human Rights Legal Support Centre Board of Directors, York University, Canada\n\nPolice in Canada recently charged Frank Stronach, the founder of auto parts manufacturer Magna International, with multiple sexual offences dating back to 1977. The charges include rape, indecent assault, sexual assault and forcible confinement. Stronach's lawyer has said he \"categorically denies\" the allegations.\n\nIn the Globe and Mail, writer Jane Boon recently described her experience with Stronach when she was a 19-year-old co-op student mentored by Stronach. The statement from Stronach's lawyer denying the criminal allegations did not specifically address the claims made by Boon.\n\nShe describes Stronach inviting her to a shareholder party, where her presence at his side didn't seem to raise an eyebrow among the attendees. Boon alleged that she was repeatedly served alcohol while Stronach proposed she stay at Magna's corporate guest house to sleep off the effects. Boon states she twice declined, but Stronach insisted on driving her alone to the guest house. As Boon alleges, her impaired condition did not preclude Stronach from having sex with her that night.\n\nSome might see the allegations against Stronach as a product of his status and corporate apparatus. However, sexual harassment is not only perpetrated by the affluent Harvey Weinsteins and Peter Nyg\u00e5rds of the world. Rather, the echoes of #MeToo are heard in our everyday workplaces and especially reverberate among female students as they seek summer employment, practicums and volunteering.\n\nHarassment in the workplace\n\nAccording to data from Statistics Canada, around half of girls and women aged 15-34 report experiencing sexual harassment and assault at work. Not surprising, a majority reported the perpetrator was a man in a position of authority.\n\nThis data exposes the reality that, for many young women, seeking employment opportunities carries serious risks of sexual harassment and violence. From offensive \"jokes,\" to a toxic workplace culture to inappropriate touching, young women are frequently caught in the dilemma of working in unsafe and undignified environments or compromising their financial security and forfeiting career dreams.\n\nI have previously served as the Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Over the years, human rights cases have exposed an alarming pattern of abuse of power, explicit solicitation and sexual assault targeting junior female staff by employers many years their senior.\n\nIn 2014, the Ontario human rights case J.D. v. The Ultimate Cut Unisex found a hair salon owner engaged in sexual harassment of two part-time students, E.D. age 15, J.D. age 20, and a third trainee. The sexual overtures were explicit. However, as J.D. explained, she needed to pay tuition and ignored them, until the physical advances escalated, compelling her to tell her parents. The human rights tribunal described the salon owner's actions as so \"offensive and intrusive\" that the girls were forced to resign for their safety.\n\nIn the 2018 case of G.M. v. X Tattoo Parlour, a 15-year-old student volunteer was sexually harassed by the owner of a tattoo parlour. The human rights tribunal found the student's delight over getting the position quickly morphed into despondency because of the egregious misconduct. The tribunal noted that, while teenagers often change their minds regarding future careers, this student did not have that opportunity, as her dream was robbed by the respondent's sexual assault.\n\nIn a British Columbia case, Basic v. Esquimalt Denture Clinic, a high school graduate was working her first professional environment job and saving for her upcoming wedding. Her employer acknowledged repeatedly touching her buttocks and breasts, claiming it was always accidental.\n\nEarlier this year, in Kreps v. AHMIC Maintenance & Storage, a 20-year-old female student was sexually harassed at her summer job by her 53-year-old boss. The tribunal heard how he orchestrated extended time alone with her, including taking her on a purported work trip to an isolated camp with no public access or cell service. The tribunal found the harassment heightened the student's vulnerability, causing her debilitating mental anguish.\n\nA systemic problem\n\nIn all these cases, sexual harassment was not perpetrated by a powerful billionaire, but by ordinary employers. This reveals how older employers routinely abuse their power to target young women in the workplace.\n\nSuch disturbing experiences of sexual harassment not only adversely impact survivors in the short-term, but as research confirms, also have serious long-term consequences destabilizing the trajectory of young women's health and futures.\n\nBoon's alleged encounter with Stronach not only stopped her from seeking further opportunities at Magna, but tainted her interest in engineering. For 15-year-old E.D., the salon owner's harassment made her fearful of working with men. Similarly, the British Columbia complainant experienced panic attacks and lost interest in her wedding plans.\n\nThe experiences of these young women in the workforce also point to a systemic problem. More needs to be done to respect the safety and dignity of young women in workplaces.\n\nTwo key risk factors correlating with workplace sexual violence are weak policies and inadequate organizational support by employers for complainants. Although all Canadian jurisdictions prohibit sexual harassment in employment, one-third of female victims indicated their workplace did not provide information on how to report the misconduct, and almost three-quarters said a bystander witnessed the impropriety.\n\nEmployers must ensure managers are educated about their legal duty to prevent sexual harassment. One concrete step is to implement zero-tolerance policies prohibiting sexual jokes and pornography, and ensuring new staff and witnesses are empowered on how to use complaint mechanisms. Human rights tribunals need to increase monetary compensation for sex-related violations to ensure that businesses understand shrugging off concerns will lead to costly liabilities.\n\nThe frequent abuses of power that vulnerable girls and young women experience at the hands of senior employers is a grave concern often ignored by society more preoccupied with scandals of the rich and famous. While high-profile cases like Stronach's make headlines, young women employed in run-of-the-mill workplaces need stronger safeguards. The pain and trauma of ordinary survivors of sexual harassment deserves our attention and protection, too.\n\n___\n\nEna Chadha is Chair of the Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Centre board of directors.\n\n___\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

She said she was the only woman who was selected for the scholarship at GMI, now Kettering University, in Flint, Michigan by Magna, a scholarship worth some $250,000.\n\nStronach invited her to his office and offered her encouragement in her career, she said.\n\nHe also invited her to Magna's annual shareholder meeting at Roy Thompson Hall in 1986, she recalled, and then to an after party at Rooney's, his Toronto restaurant.\n\n\"I was game. And so flattered by the attention. Then, things got weird,\" she said. Stronach danced with her and fed her strawberries, she said.\n\n\"Stronach announces to the driver that I've had too much to drink. That I'm in no condition to drive back to Guelph. And that he will drive me to the guest house,\" she said.\n\nThe guest house was in Magna-owned Simeon Park, which is described on Magna's website as a facility \"established to provide a setting for peaceful and natural experiences for Magna employees and their invited guests.\" The materials say the park closes at 8 p.m.\n\n\"There was this delay where it all sort of clicked together in my head. I was like, 'Oh boy. I've just messed up. I did something really stupid. I think I'm going to have to sleep with him now,'\" she said.\n\nBoon said as soon as she heard of the charges this year, she phoned the Peel Regional Police, who interviewed her. She said she felt treated very well and is encouraging others who may have information to get in touch with them and further their investigation.\n\nBoon said she has a lot of questions about what, if anything, Magna employees knew about what their CEO may have been up to. And, as an engineer, she says people should ask whether there were systems in place at Magna to send women to him.\n\n\"I have no idea if anyone else [was a] witting or unwitting participants in the scheme.

The statement from Stronach's lawyer denying the criminal allegations did not specifically address the claims made by Boon.\n\nShe describes Stronach inviting her to a shareholder party, where her presence at his side didn't seem to raise an eyebrow among the attendees. Boon alleged that she was repeatedly served alcohol while Stronach proposed she stay at Magna's corporate guest house to sleep off the effects. Boon states she twice declined, but Stronach insisted on driving her alone to the guest house. As Boon alleges, her impaired condition did not preclude Stronach from having sex with her that night.\n\nSome might see the allegations against Stronach as a product of his status and corporate apparatus. However, sexual harassment is not only perpetrated by the affluent Harvey Weinsteins and Peter Nyg\u00e5rds of the world. Rather, the echoes of #MeToo are heard in our everyday workplaces and especially reverberate among female students as they seek summer employment, practicums and volunteering.\n\nHarassment in the workplace\n\nAccording to data from Statistics Canada, around half of girls and women aged 15-34 report experiencing sexual harassment and assault at work. Not surprising, a majority reported the perpetrator was a man in a position of authority.\n\nThis data exposes the reality that, for many young women, seeking employment opportunities carries serious risks of sexual harassment and violence. From offensive \"jokes,\" to a toxic workplace culture to inappropriate touching, young women are frequently caught in the dilemma of working in unsafe and undignified environments or compromising their financial security and forfeiting career dreams.\n\nI have previously served as the Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Over the years, human rights cases have exposed an alarming pattern of abuse of power, explicit solicitation and sexual assault targeting junior female staff by employers many years their senior.\n\nIn 2014, the Ontario human rights case J.D. v. The Ultimate Cut Unisex found a hair salon owner engaged in sexual harassment of two part-time students, E.D. age 15, J.D. age 20, and a third trainee. The sexual overtures were explicit. However, as J.D. explained, she needed to pay tuition and ignored them, until the physical advances escalated, compelling her to tell her parents. The human rights tribunal described the salon owner's actions as so \"offensive and intrusive\" that the girls were forced to resign for their safety.\n\nIn the 2018 case of G.M. v. X Tattoo Parlour, a 15-year-old student volunteer was sexually harassed by the owner of a tattoo parlour. The human rights tribunal found the student's delight over getting the position quickly morphed into despondency because of the egregious misconduct. The tribunal noted that, while teenagers often change their minds regarding future careers, this student did not have that opportunity, as her dream was robbed by the respondent's sexual assault.\n\nIn a British Columbia case, Basic v. Esquimalt Denture Clinic, a high school graduate was working her first professional environment job and saving for her upcoming wedding. Her employer acknowledged repeatedly touching her buttocks and breasts, claiming it was always accidental.\n\nEarlier this year, in Kreps v. AHMIC Maintenance & Storage, a 20-year-old female student was sexually harassed at her summer job by her 53-year-old boss. The tribunal heard how he orchestrated extended time alone with her, including taking her on a purported work trip to an isolated camp with no public access or cell service. The tribunal found the harassment heightened the student's vulnerability, causing her debilitating mental anguish.\n\nA systemic problem\n\nIn all these cases, sexual harassment was not perpetrated by a powerful billionaire, but by ordinary employers. This reveals how older employers routinely abuse their power to target young women in the workplace.\n\nSuch disturbing experiences of sexual harassment not only adversely impact survivors in the short-term, but as research confirms, also have serious long-term consequences destabilizing the trajectory of young women's health and futures.\n\nBoon's alleged encounter with Stronach not only stopped her from seeking further opportunities at Magna, but tainted her interest in engineering. For 15-year-old E.D., the salon owner's harassment made her fearful of working with men. Similarly, the British Columbia complainant experienced panic attacks and lost interest in her wedding plans.\n\nThe experiences of these young women in the workforce also point to a systemic problem. More needs to be done to respect the safety and dignity of young women in workplaces.\n\nTwo key risk factors correlating with workplace sexual violence are weak policies and inadequate organizational support by employers for complainants. Although all Canadian jurisdictions prohibit sexual harassment in employment, one-third of female victims indicated their workplace did not provide information on how to report the misconduct, and almost three-quarters said a bystander witnessed the impropriety.\n\nEmployers must ensure managers are educated about their legal duty to prevent sexual harassment. One concrete step is to implement zero-tolerance policies prohibiting sexual jokes and pornography, and ensuring new staff and witnesses are empowered on how to use complaint mechanisms. Human rights tribunals need to increase monetary compensation for sex-related violations to ensure that businesses understand shrugging off concerns will lead to costly liabilities.\n\nThe frequent abuses of power that vulnerable girls and young women experience at the hands of senior employers is a grave concern often ignored by society more preoccupied with scandals of the rich and famous. While high-profile cases like Stronach's make headlines, young women employed in run-of-the-mill workplaces need stronger safeguards. The pain and trauma of ordinary survivors of sexual harassment deserves our attention and protection, too.\n\nEna Chadha is Chair of the Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Centre board of directors.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

It was a messy break that eventually resulted in a tampering charge and gave the Eagles some extra draft ammo. But it also gave them a late start on hiring a coordinator.\n\nBy that time, Fangio had already agreed to become the defensive coordinator in Miami and didn't want to go back on his word.\n\nSo the Eagles pivoted and hired a Fangio understudy in Sean Desai, who lasted 13 games before being demoted and then eventually fired after the season.\n\nA year later, Fangio is finally the Eagles' defensive coordinator. That seemed incredibly likely from the moment the NFL world learned he was parting ways with the Dolphins after just one season in Miami.\n\nFangio on Thursday was asked if it was his expectation to join the Eagles after leaving the Dolphins. He was asked if he left Miami to come here.\n\nAgain, the 65-year-old veteran coach was extremely forthcoming.\n\n\"Basically, yes,\" he said.\n\nThere were some reports that surfaced after Fangio's split with the Dolphins that he didn't get along with many players in Miami and that friction made the season difficult.\n\n\"I didn't see that at all, really,\" Fangio said about those reports. \"Anything we do, whether there, here, or anywhere else I've been, is what we think is the best for the team and best for the defense, specifically, to stop somebody. Wherever that falls, that's where it falls.\"\n\nEven though Fangio admits he wasn't in the building that often, the Eagles already had Fangio in-house during the 2022 Super Bowl season when he was working as a consultant. Fangio said that during that stint, 95% of his time was spent helping to give the offense a defensive perspective, while 5% was used on helping Gannon and the defense.\n\nBut after the Eagles had worked so hard to implement many staples of a Fangio defense in recent seasons, it seemed like a no-brainer to hire him for the DC job this offseason.\n\nAnd for Fangio, this job is a chance to bring his career full-circle and perhaps end it in his home state of Pennsylvania. Fangio, a Dunmore, Pennsylvania, native, actually began his professional coaching career with the Philadelphia Stars of the USFL in 1984.\n\nSo there's no wonder he wanted to come back to Philadelphia.\n\n\"Well, it was exactly 40 years ago when I started my pro coaching career across the street at Veterans Stadium, and I thought it would be cool to hopefully end it here. So, 40 years later, here I am,\" Fangio said.\n\n\"A lot of things change, and a lot of things don't. One of the first things I've done, several times, I still go to the Philadium down on Packer (Ave.) for my meals, just like I did way back then. Phillies are still playing good. You guys didn't clobber them for losing one game yesterday, did you? But no, just to come back, my kids live two hours south of here. My mother, who's 97, lives two hours north of here. So, a lot of family considerations.\n\n\"I was a big Philly fan growing up in all sports. It was a thrill for me to go to work every day at Veterans Stadium 40 years ago because I used to go to games there all the time.

Not even Fangio could have foreseen a professional coaching career that spanned 40 years that involved being a defensive coordinator for seven teams and working his way up to a head-coaching position with the Denver Broncos.\n\nFangio wouldn't have lasted in the NFL this long if he didn't adjust to the times. For a career that started as a defensive assistant with the Stars, it all comes full circle.\n\n\"I thought it would be cool to hopefully end it here,\" Fangio said at his first press conference since becoming defensive coordintaor of the Philadelphia Eagles. \"So, 40 years later, here I am.\"\n\nFangio does intend to end his career with the Eagles, his seventh stop as a defensive coordinator in a league were he earned his first job as a linebackers coach as a 28-year-old with the New Orleans Saints in 1986. After grooming Hall of Famers Rickey Jackson and Sam Mills, Fangio earned his first defensive coordinator job with the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1995.\n\nWell respected around the league, and the architect of the defensive philosophy many teams in the league are emulating, things haven't changed much for Fangio since returning to Philadelphia.\n\n\"One of the first things I've done, several times, I still go to the Philadium down on Packer [Avenue] for my meals, just like I did way back then,\" Fangio said. \"Just to come back, my kids live two hours south of here.

And now it's a good thrill to come back 40 years later and hopefully finish it out here.\"\n\nA Dunmore, Pennsylvania, native, the 65-year-old Fangio has built a reputation as one of the brilliant defensive minds in today's NFL. His defenses have finished in the top 10 in points allowed eight times and in the top 10 in yards allowed 10 times. When Fangio was the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2014, his defenses never finished outside the top 10 in points or yards allowed.\n\n\"Good players. And I'm not trying to be a wise guy with that,\" Fangio said when asked about the important elements of his defense. \"We have a system that is versatile, we like to think. It needs to be versatile because every week you're facing different strengths of an offense, different schemes.\n\n\"You have to have a versatile system for the offenses today in the NFL. What we'll eventually do is learn what our guys are best at.\"\n\nFangio had the opportunity to join the Eagles after the 2022 season, but the timing didn't mix. He was in the building during preparation for Super Bowl LVII, helping the offense get a good look at the defense they were going to face in the Kansas City Chiefs (the Eagles offense scored 35 points, most by a losing team in the Super Bowl). Fangio accepted an offer to become the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator prior to Jonathan Gannon accepting the Arizona Cardinals head-coaching job, which was after the Super Bowl LVII loss.\n\nAfter the Dolphins finished 22nd in points allowed and 10th in yards allowed, the Eagles had a defensive coordinator opening. Sean Desai was fired and the Eagles allowed Matt Patricia's contract to expire.\n\nFangio saw an opportunity to head to Philadelphia, just a year later than he originally thought.\n\n\"I think that's a fair assumption,\" Fangio said. \"Anything we do, whether there, here, or anywhere else I've been, is what we think is the best for the team and best for the defense, specifically, to stop somebody. Wherever that falls, that's where it falls.\"\n\nIf Fangio has it his way, he'll finish a distinguished coaching career with the Eagles. Philadelphia is where Fangio got his start, and where he wants to end on his terms.\n\n\"I would think so,\" Fangio said. \"But as we all know in this business, nothing's guaranteed.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_kerr@cbssports.com", "name": "Jeff Kerr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Veterans Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickey_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rickey Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Fangio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vic Fangio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunmore,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dunmore, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunmore, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVII", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Patricia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Patricia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/01/24/454b821b-c5b7-49b1-86a3-2e32dac86152/thumbnail/1200x675/ee10996d467dcbf9ebc2c87cee575828/fangio.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554900", "eventUri": "eng-9554900", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Given the choice, the veteran coach said this would be his final stop.\n\n\"I thought it would be cool to hopefully end it here,\" Fangio said. \"So, 40 years later, here I am.\"\n\n\"My kids live two hours south of here,\" Fangio added. \"My mother, who's 97, lives two hours north of here.

He joined the Dolphins' staff last offseason after spending the 2023 playoffs in an advisory role on the Eagles' coaching staff helping the offense.\n\nFangio said it was a \"fair assumption\" to say he would have joined the Eagles staff last offseason had the timing worked out differently. Former Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon left the Eagles' staff for his current role as the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals a few days after Super Bowl LVII after Fangio had already agreed to join the Dolphins' staff. A few months after Gannon's departure, the NFL concluded Arizona made impermissible contact with Gannon in January shortly after the NFC championship game.\n\nFangio, who the Eagles hired three days after his Miami departure, also addressed the notion that he butted heads with Dolphins players during his lone season there. Player agent Drew Rosenhaus, who represents 11 players on the Dolphins' 2023-24 roster, told local Miami television station WSVN that Fangio was a polarizing figure among the players.\n\n\" READ MORE: Eagles' Nick Sirianni endorses his new-look coaching staff with coordinators Kellen Moore and Vic Fangio\n\n\"I didn't see that at all,\" Fangio said. \"Anything we do, whether there, here or anywhere else, is what we think is the best for the team and best for the defense specifically to stop somebody. And wherever that falls, that's where it falls.\"\n\nThe Eagles new offensive coordinator is in the process of creating a new language.\n\nMoore is tasked with reversing course for a group that regressed last season, but just how much latitude he'll be granted to change coach Nick Sirianni's existing scheme remains to be seen.\n\nOn Thursday, Moore alluded to the offense's past success when discussing how different things could look with him calling plays.\n\n\"Our real focus here as we've gone through this process is, you know, we have a lot of good going on,\" Moore said. \"We can't lose the good and the reps that Jalen [Hurts] and AJ [Brown] have developed and Dallas [Goedert] has developed and this offensive line that we've developed. How can we build off of those things and really connect the whole thing?\"\n\n\" READ MORE: After signing extension, A.J. Brown calls Philadelphia 'home,' says he 'learned from' sports radio call\n\nMoore, who spent last season as the Los Angeles Chargers' offensive coordinator after spending the previous five seasons on the Dallas Cowboys' staff, said the biggest challenge in merging two schemes is sorting out the terminology without eventual confusion.\n\nThe 35-year-old said some of the Eagles' verbiage will stay the same, but others will come from each of his previous stops.\n\n\"It's a combination of things that we can build off of,\" Moore said. \"If everyone understands a play and it makes sense, then let's keep things in place. It's not that complicated. We will continue to evolve a system to make sure the language ties together and make sure the communication can be clean, whether it comes from Philadelphia, Los Angeles, or somewhere in between, we're building that as we go.\"\n\nAs a former quarterback, Moore said he emphasizes a \"clean operation\" as a play-caller both during the week and on game days, which ties into the need to simplify terminology. When asked if it would be a complicated process maintaining some of the Eagles' existing calls with what he's used in the past, Moore said it's something he's done before.\n\n\"A lot of us have been exposed to this,\" Moore said. \"I think the biggest thing is just making sure the language is just connected. When I was in Dallas, every single year we went through this process, it was the same process. ... Some of this language will fall into 2023 Philly, some of it will fall into Dallas or L.A., some of it will ultimately come from, 'Hey we just want to clean this whole thing up, we're just going to create a new family of words association.'\"\n\nFangio doesn't believe players have changed much in the last 40 years.\n\nThe longtime defensive coach and the author of the en vogue system so many of his peers have borrowed from over the last few seasons said the conditions around players have shifted more than the individuals themselves during his time coaching professional football.\n\n\"People aren't expecting as much out of players as we used to expect,\" Fangio said. \"And these players will work and give you everything they got within reason. ... You hear it in the NBA: load management, and I talk to coaches in other sports and it drives them crazy. The players are willing to work, I've never had an issue with that, and they're still willing to work, but we, as the so-called adults in the room, need to push them.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Eagles rookie CBs Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean getting better acquainted during minicamp\n\nFangio's philosophy clashes with the Eagles' approach the last few seasons to some degree. Under Sirianni, the team has typically favored shorter, more intense practices often separated by days off during training camp and gone with fewer padded practices during the season to keep players fresh.\n\n\"You have to make due with what you got,\" Fangio said of the Eagles' approach. \"But I'll always push for more.\"\n\nThe Eagles are doing more this spring than they have the past few off-seasons. They have seven OTA practices scheduled, starting later this month, and will also hold a mandatory minicamp next month for the first time since Sirianni took over.\n\nWhen asked if he advocated for a busier offseason program before joining the Eagles' staff, Fangio deferred to Sirianni, saying, \"I'll let Nick answer that for you.\"\n\nAlthough he wasn't running the Eagles' defense last year, Fangio offered his take on what went wrong for the group during the team's late-season collapse.\n\nThe Eagles ranked 30th in points allowed and 31st in third-down conversion percentage last year, leading to defensive coordinator Sean Desai, a former Chicago Bears assistant coach under Fangio, getting stripped of play-calling duties in favor of senior defensive assistant Matt Patricia late in the regular season.\n\nNeither coach solved what ailed the Eagles' defense, which dealt with a litany of injuries in the secondary and linebacker positions for most of the season.\n\n\" READ MORE: Thumbs up or down: Eagles beat writers weigh in on drafting Jalyx Hunt\n\n\"They weren't playing good, they had injuries, so there was a lot of moving parts,\" Fangio said. \" ... When things aren't going good, you need to go back to basics. I'll tell the players early in camp that if we're struggling, don't expect me to magically scheme our way out of it during a game. We're going back to basics and we're going to call the things that we've been practicing since Day 1 and we're going to fight our way out of it. If you don't have that foundation and you're always grabbing for the perfect call, it'll be OK for a little bit, but eventually you're going to get gashed.\"\n\nSpecial teams coordinator Michael Clay, the only incumbent coordinator from last year's staff, has spent his offseason studying the NFL's new kickoff format, borrowed from the XFL.\n\nThe new kickoff, which incentivizes returns with most players on each side lining up within five yards of each other and giving returners more space to pick up speed, will be implemented at the start of next season.\n\n\"You really don't know what to expect,\" Clay said. \"No one really has even seen it. Even from an XFL aspect, there's still a lot of nuances from the XFL rules to what we're trying to get done in the NFL.\"\n\nThe Eagles have added several players with experience returning kicks both in the NFL draft and free agency. Rookies Cooper DeJean, Will Shipley, and Ainias Smith all returned kicks in college while wide receiver Parris Campbell and cornerback Isaiah Rodgers have done so in the league.\n\nClay said there's some uncertainty on what style returner will be most effective with the new format, but acknowledged the options the team has added this offseason to go along with Britain Covey, who's been the team's primary punt returner the last two seasons.\n\n\"Covey is a great option to have as a punt returner,\" Clay said. \"We brought in some guys that have some punt-return abilities. As we move forward, competition usually breeds greatness, so having other guys out there ... it allows them to get some film and get some feel.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType":

How Kellen Moore will tweak offense", "body": "PHILADELPHIA - Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio provided a glimpse into their systems more three months since they were hired.\n\nBut it was only a glimpse.\n\nFangio, who's 65, has a wealth of knowledge on defense, having served as a head coach for three years in Denver and as a defensive coordinator for two decades in the NFL. The Eagles, in fact, have tried to emulate his system with previous coordinators Jonathan Gannon (2021-22) and Sean Desai (2023) to mixed results.\n\nGRAND TIME: Why grand slamming Bryce Harper, Phillies are loosest, sexiest Brandon Marsh rock band team\n\nCRASH COURSE: Eagles Jalyx Hunt goes from calling GM 'Big Pimpin' to crash course on NFL at rookie camp\n\nFangio and the Dolphins mutually parted ways after last season, and he jumped at the chance to return to Philly where he began his coaching career 40 years ago in the USFL with the Philadelphia Stars.\n\n\"Exactly 40 years ago, when I started my pro coaching career across the street at Veterans Stadium, I thought it'd be cool to hopefully end it here,\" he said Thursday. \"So 40 years later, here I am.\"\n\nFangio, of course, will have autonomy over the defense because Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni is primarily an offensive coach.\n\nThat's not necessarily the case for Moore, who has the balancing act of meshing Sirianni's system for three years while adding his touches to an offense that even Sirianni said had grown stale last season when the Eagles went 1-6 to close the season.\n\nThat, of course, is why both Desai and his late-season replacement, Matt Patricia, were let go, as was offensive coordinator Brian Johnson.\n\nSo yes, there will be changes on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"I think everyone's got their different flavor from a systematic approach,\" Moore said. \"I think our real focus here, as we've gone through this process is, we got a lot of good going on ... But there will be tweaks. There will be changes. Everything is constantly evolving. That's part of this whole offseason program.\"\n\nHere, then, are five takeaways from Fangio and Moore's press conferences:\n\nFangio would have come to Eagles in 2023 instead of Desai\n\nThe Eagles were already familiar with Fangio when they were looking for a defensive coordinator in Feb. 2023, just after losing to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nFangio was actually serving as a consultant for the Eagles for two weeks before the Super Bowl. Fangio studied the Chiefs defense to benefit the Eagles' offense.\n\nBut the Eagles were reportedly under the assumption that Gannon would return as defensive coordinator. Two days after the Super Bowl, Gannon became the Arizona Cardinals' head coach. A few months later, the Cardinals admitted to tampering by contacting Gannon during a \"dead period\" for coaches.\n\nFangio, however, had already accepted a job as the Dolphins' defensive coordinator. So the Eagles hired Desai.\n\nAsked Thursday if he would have taken the Eagles job instead, Fangio said: \"I think that's a fair assumption.\"\n\nWhat does Fangio expect from Jalen Carter, Jordan Davis?\n\nIt's easy to see that the Eagles have big plans for defensive tackles Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis after Fletcher Cox's retirement.\n\nAs a rookie in 2023, Carter had 6.5 sacks, but faded down the stretch of the season. The same is true with Davis, who improved from his rookie season in 2022.\n\nStill, neither Carter nor Davis played 50% of the defensive snaps last season. They were significantly behind Cox, who led the defensive tackles with 59% of the snaps.\n\nFangio said that will change this season, and that work has already begun during the two-plus weeks of strength and conditioning drills, with organized team activities coming the week of May 20.\n\n\"I think he's talented enough that no matter what we do with him, we'll be maximizing him,\" Fangio said about Carter. \"He's gotta get in great shape, which I think he's off to a great start here, so that we can play him a lot.\"\n\nThe Eagles didn't sign a free agent or draft a player at defensive tackle, a clear indication that they have high expectations for Carter and Davis.\n\nKellen Moore loves Jalen Hurts' uniqueness\n\nMoore has served as an offensive coordinator in Dallas with quarterback Dak Prescott and last season with the Chargers with quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nBoth are considered prolific passers, while Hurts adds the dimension of his running ability, having gained at least 605 yards rushing in each of his three seasons as a full-time starter.\n\n\"I've really enjoyed Jalen's process,\" Moore said. \"He's a really smart player. He has a great feel for this game. The more conversations we have, the more we get to make these adjustments and build off this thing. Jalen is one of the premier quarterbacks in this league for a reason.\n\n\"Certainly, what Jalen has done in the run game, there are a handful of guys who can do this in this league. And so, it's a really advantageous thing that we can continue to utilize, and certainly we will.\"\n\nMoore is also excited about Saquon Barkley\n\nMoore, of course, had a great offensive situation in Dallas with Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliott in his prime and receivers led by Amari Cooper and CeeDee Lamb.\n\nSo Moore knows how to relate with the Eagles' skill position players of Hurts, running back Saquon Barkley and wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, along with tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nCan he keep everybody happy?\n\n\"Certainly we're really excited about the guys that we have in place here,\" Moore said. \"A lot of guys who can do a lot of different roles and a lot of variety. That excites us as far as just the way we can present things for the defense, challenge people pre-snap with all the different alignments and personnel groups that we can play with.\"\n\nOf Fangio and Phillies Nick Castellanos\n\nFangio admitted that he's a huge Phillies fan. So he was asked about how coaching in the NFL is different from coaching in the major leagues.\n\nFangio said he loves the football aspect because there are only 17 games, and they're once a week, so you have time to teach and correct. There's no time for that in a baseball season that lasts for 162 games.\n\nThat also, of course, increases the importance of an NFL game. And here, Fangio mentioned how Phillies manager Rob Thomson has the luxury of sticking with a slumping player like right fielder Nick Castellanos, whereas he can't with a slumping player on defense.\n\n\"He's letting Castellanos fight his way out of his slump,\" Fangio said about Thomson. \"We can't do that here. And (the Phillies) wouldn't do that if they were in the playoffs either.\"", "source": {"uri": "delawareonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Carter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Fangio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vic Fangio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellen_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kellen Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sirianni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Sirianni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eagles (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Davis_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Davis (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Patricia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Patricia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterans Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fletcher Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVonta_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeVonta Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.

However, questions arose about his ability to connect with modern players after several Miami players voiced frustrations with the veteran coach's gruff style.\n\n\"I respected him a lot. I'm not surprised he's about to land in Philly because people behind closed doors were saying he was trying to get to Philly anyways.

The 35-year-old was Sirianni's first choice in the hiring cycle, owner Jeffrey Lurie said, and he's tasked with reviving a talented roster that underperformed within a scheme Sirianni said got stale in 2023.\n\nPhiladelphia's defense was consistently dismal last season. Fangio, a seven-time NFL defensive coordinator and former head coach of the Denver Broncos, returned to his home state to repair a system that foundered under his onetime pupil Sean Desai.\n\nHere are the most relevant takeaways from the presser as the Eagles enter Phase 3 of their offseason program, in which on-field workouts begin but no live contact is permitted.\n\nMoore echoed Sirianni's offseason sentiments by saying, \"I think our real focus here as we've gone through this process is we've got a lot of good going on.\" Even in the middle of his first major staff overhaul, Sirianni often insisted there were successful parts of his offensive system that he wanted to retain.\n\nWhat will be retained? Moore offered no specific answer. He said, \"We're at a really beginning level of this thing.\" The Eagles begin OTAs on May 20, when they'll hit the field for the first time. Even then, Moore said it won't be until training camp when they'll start installing the run game, play-action schemes \"and how all that connects.\" It was also notable that Moore said the Eagles will \"continue to embrace\" quarterback Jalen Hurts as a runner. Hurts rushed for 605 yards and 15 touchdowns in 2023 while managing a midseason knee injury.\n\nMoore is expected to incorporate more pre-snap motions into this year's offense. The Eagles ranked last in pre-snap motion usage in 2023 under Sirianni and former offensive coordinator Brian Johnson, according to ESPN. Moore's offense with the Los Angeles Chargers ranked eighth.\n\n\"It's always kind of stuck with me,\" said Moore, a former NFL quarterback who also used plenty of motion in college at Boise State. \"There's always advantages to it. There's some things where you're trying to gather information from the defense. There's other times when you're simply stressing the defense. And so there's those two elements, and ultimately you're trying to build packages and create things so ... there's alignment and similarities with the presentations that allows us to stress the defense with those different looks.\"\n\nIf there's a thematic word from Moore's first news conference, it's \"clean.\" Above all else as a play caller, Moore said he values keeping a \"clean operation\" for the quarterback.\n\n\"We understand that adjustments have to be made during games,\" Moore said. \"There always has to be those elements. But you've got to have a clean, steady operation for the quarterback. He deals with a lot during games. (You have to) understand that aspect of it, and hopefully I can provide that.\"\n\nHurts threw a career-high 15 interceptions in 2023, often struggling against the blitz. He ranked 20th in the NFL in terms of expected points added when facing five pass rushers or more, according to TruMedia. Moore said he's spent the initial portion of the offseason focusing on how Hurts \"processes the game.\" He called Hurts \"one of the premier quarterbacks in this league,\" a \"really smart player\" who \"has a great feel for this game.\"\n\nSirianni kept all but three coaches on his offensive staff. Moore brought quarterbacks coach Doug Nussmeier and offensive assistant Kyle Valero from Los Angeles. Moore, who said \"you always have to be conscious of how many voices are with the quarterback,\" also said Nussmeier works with Hurts on the technique side, which frees Moore to work with Hurts more on the scheme side.\n\nThe key to handling pressure, Moore said again, is cleanliness.\n\n\"I think it's just having a clean toolbox,\" Moore said. \"There's a lot of different things we can do. But just making sure it's clean, effective and, as you build it, you've got to continue to evolve so that one week maybe your answer is a certain play and maybe the next week you've got to make the adjustment off that. And so that's, I think, the continuous evolution through the season. There's going to be different challenges each and every week. We're going to walk into a room and deal with the blitz protection, and we're going to look at it and there's going to be a couple of different challenges each and every week.\"\n\nIn 1984, Fangio began his pro coaching career as a defensive assistant for the USFL's Philadelphia Stars.\n\n\"I thought it'd be cool to hopefully end it here,\" said Fangio, a native of Dunmore, Pa. \"So, 40 years later, here I am.\"\n\nFangio often made family visits to Pennsylvania during his career. His mother lives two hours north of Philadelphia. His kids live two hours south. Fangio is comfortable in his home state. He grew up a fan of all Philadelphia teams, especially the Phillies. He still frequently eats at the Philadium, a classic spot near the city's cluster of stadiums.\n\n\"It was a thrill for me to go to work every day at Veterans Stadium 40 years ago, because I used to go to games there all the time,\" Fangio said. \"And now, I'm thrilled to come back 40 years later and hopefully finish it out here.\"\n\nFangio addressed his past newsworthiness in relation to the Eagles, which has been well-documented.\n\nWould he have been the Eagles' defensive coordinator last year had there been more clarity about Jonathan Gannon's departure?\n\n\"Yeah, I didn't see that at all, really. Anything we do either here, there or anywhere else I've been is what we think is best for the team and best for the defense specifically to stop somebody, and wherever that falls, that's where it falls.\"\n\nWhat did he make of the Eagles' defensive struggles under Desai, who was an assistant under Fangio with the Chicago Bears?\n\n\"I really don't know. Anytime it goes bad like it did, everybody has their fingerprints on it. It's not just one thing or one person.\"\n\nFangio is arguably the most influential defensive mind in the modern NFL. Several teams cherry-pick concepts from his system, if not his philosophies entirely.\n\nFangio, who was fired by the Broncos after the 2021 season, spent the following year in what he characterized as a sabbatical. He stayed home and studied film. He searched for trends and how to adapt his concepts. Even after departing the Dolphins, he said he studied at least two defenses, deducing new wrinkles to deploy.\n\n\"We have a system that is versatile, we like to think,\" Fangio said. \"It needs to be versatile because every week you're facing different strengths of an offense, different schemes. What you play in one week, 10 to 15 times, you may not play at all the next week. You have to have a versatile system for the offenses today in the NFL, and what we'll eventually do is learn what our guys are best at.\n\n\"So, I like to throw a lot at them early because I think one of the worst things you can do is come Week 3, Week 5, 'Man, we could really use this scheme but it hasn't been introduced to the players yet.' Whereas if you'd introduced it to them in training camp and worked on it, when you pull it back out three to four weeks later, there's recall.\"\n\nPoor tackling persisted for the Eagles in 2023. In an era of limited practices and rules restricting certain levels of contact, Fangio said, \"I keep pushing for more.\" It's expected that Sirianni will increase the frequency and intensity of practices in 2024. How much more will there be this offseason?\n\n\"I'll let Nick answer that for you,\" Fangio said.\n\nUltimately, the Eagles are counting on the belief that defensive problems won't snowball under Fangio's expertise, as they did in 2023 when Sirianni demoted Desai midseason after losing faith in his ability to field successful game plans. What is Fangio's approach when faced with such circumstances?\n\n\"When things aren't going good, you need to go back to basics,\" Fangio said. \"I'll tell the players early in camp that if we're struggling, don't expect me to magically scheme our way out of it during a game. We're going back to basics, and we're going to call the things that we've been practicing since day one, and we've got to fight our way out of it. And if you don't have that foundation, and you're always grabbing for the perfect call, you'll be OK for a little bit. But eventually, you're going to get gashed.\"\n\nOn first-round cornerback Quinyon Mitchell: \"He's obviously got good movement. He's got good size for a corner. He's going to have to adapt to the NFL game, cover NFL receivers, NFL scheme and the passing game. There's a lot to learn. But we think he's the right guy emotionally and mentally to do that, and hopefully he'll pay dividends quickly rather than later. But he's going to be one of the many competing.\"\n\nOn how they'll develop versatile players like defensive back Cooper DeJean: \"You start them out at a primary position, and then you start giving them the secondary position, and then you'll go from there.\"\n\nOn free-agent edge rusher Bryce Huff: \"(GM) Howie (Roseman) asked us to watch him ... myself and (defensive ends/outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn). We liked him. He's been a good pass rusher for the Jets playing in somewhat of a part-time role. Hopefully, we can make him proficient enough to where he plays more, meaning his run play and on the occasion or two that we may want to drop him.\"\n\n\"The great thing about it, 31 other teams are in the same boat in terms of that,\" Clay said. \"It's going to be exciting and interesting all at the same time because you really don't know what to expect because no one's really even seen it. Even from an XFL aspect, there's still a lot of nuances from the XFL rules, what they implemented to what we want to get done here in the NFL. It's an exciting time. It's a lot of retraining for a lot of these veteran guys who are so used to these new rules, to just relearning them from the ground up.\"\n\nEagles return specialist Britain Covey led the NFL with 417 punt return yards in 2023. Still, the Eagles drafted players like DeJean and wide receiver Ainias Smith who were proficient punt returners in college. What does that mean for Covey?\n\n\"Covey's a great option to have as a punt returner. We've brought in some guys who do have some punt return abilities. As we move forward, competition usually breeds greatness. So, having other guys out there and also getting to see these guys, if you remember last year from preseason, we didn't have the greatest amount of punt returners, so I had to throw (cornerback) Zech McPhearson out there. That does him a little bit of disservice. He hasn't done it since high school. But having all these possible punt returners allows them to get some film, get some feel.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

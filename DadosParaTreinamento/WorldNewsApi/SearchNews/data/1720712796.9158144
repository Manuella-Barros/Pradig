{"id": 232103348, "title": "Southern Baptists have a busy few days ahead of them, from women pastors to sexual abuse to Trump", "text": "Thousands will gather in Indianapolis June 11-12 for the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention. The meeting comes at a fraught time in the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. Messengers - as voting delegates are known - will vote on whether to establish a constitutional ban on churches with women pastors. They\u2019ll hear a report - and get outside criticism - of their handling of sexual abuse among their clergy. With membership in steady decline, they\u2019ll hear a report on how an earlier effort to reverse that trend fell short. And they\u2019ll vote for a new president from among six candidates. Speaking of presidential candidates, an outside group is inviting attendees to a virtual speech by former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, at an off-site event. Proposed resolutions deal with topics ranging from Gaza to abortion and in vitro fertilization. Here\u2019s some of what\u2019s facing the SBC: The convention has struggled to respond to sexual abuse in its churches since a 2019 report by the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News, saying that roughly 380 Southern Baptist church leaders and volunteers faced allegations of sexual misconduct in the previous two decades. A subsequent consultant\u2019s report said past leaders on the convention\u2019s Executive Committee intimidated and mistreated survivors who sought help. But survivors and advocates say the denomination\u2019s actions don\u2019t match its promises of reform. An Abuse Reform Implementation Task Force recently concluded its work. While it has provided a curriculum for training churches on preventing and responding to abuse, it has not achieved the mandate of previous annual meetings to establish a database of offenders, which could help churches avoid hiring them. In a recent YouTube interview with a fellow pastor, the chairman of the SBC\u2019s Executive Committee, Philip Robertson, sought to downplay reports that there was a \u201csystemic problem\u201d of abuse in the denomination, which he contended were \u201cnot true.\u201d This has been a talking point for some outside critics of SBC efforts to respond to the crisis, now voiced by at least one person in SBC leadership. Robertson also said insurers warned they wouldn\u2019t cover the denomination if it had the database due to liability risks. In response, the reform task force proposed having a separate nonprofit handle the list, but that has yet to materialize. \u201cRobertson\u2019s remarks provide a window onto what has always been true,\u201d said Christa Brown, a longtime advocate for fellow survivors of abuse within Southern Baptist churches, in an email. \u201cSBC officials\u2019 resistance to a database has always been about trying to minimize liability risks to the institution. \u2026 And SBC officials are trying to operate this multi-billion dollar organization without taking on the inherent responsibilities that go along with it.\u201d In May, federal prosecutors charged Matt Queen, a former professor and administrator at an SBC-affiliated seminary in Texas with providing federal investigators with a false document. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York asserted this document, involving an alleged case of sexual abuse by a seminary student, was provided with the intent to impede their investigation into sexual abuse within the convention. The Executive Committee says it was told the federal investigation into its own actions has been completed. In 2000, Southern Baptists amended the Baptist Faith and Message, their statement of doctrine, to say the office of pastor is limited to men, citing Bible verses such as one forbidding \u201ca woman to teach or to have authority over a man.\u201d This came amid a larger rightward push in the late 20th century SBC. The doctrinal statement is nonbinding, and the denomination can\u2019t tell its independent churches whom to call as pastor. Some churches with women pastors left, while others stayed but kept a low profile. Still others later appointed women pastors or allowed women to serve under male leaders in associate pastoral roles, citing biblical examples of women in ministry. At this year\u2019s meeting, messengers will vote on whether to give final approval to amending their constitution to ban churches \u2013 by deeming them not in \u201cfriendly cooperation\u201d \u2013 with women pastors in lead or associate roles. The denomination preliminarily approved the amendment last year. That\u2019s when it also began expelling congregations with women pastors, such as Saddleback Church, a California megachurch, on the grounds that they don\u2019t closely identify with the Baptist Faith and Message. The amendment would codify an explicit ban on such churches, putting them in the same category as churches that \u201cendorse homosexual behavior,\u201d discriminate based on ethnicity or fail to address sexual abuse. The National African American Fellowship, a caucus of predominantly Black congregations within the SBC, says an amendment barring churches with women pastors could disproportionately impact its members, many with women working in assistant pastor roles. Chinese and Hispanic Baptist fellowship leaders also say their churches could be impacted because of language differences in how pastors are described. The Southern Baptist Convention is the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. Members are overwhelmingly evangelical and conservative both in religion and politics, the continuation of a rightward shift that began in the 1980s. The denomination was founded in 1845 in defense of slavery in a schism with northern Baptists. In 1995, the mostly white denomination formally repented of its support for slavery and other racism, and it made some strides to diversify racially. It has lost some Black churches and pastors in recent years due to alleged racial insensitivity within its overwhelmingly white leadership. Southern Baptist membership has steadily declined since 2006 and is now below 13 million, its lowest since 1976. There are also long-term declines in baptisms \u2013 the prime metric of spiritual vitality. Alarmed by such trends, Southern Baptists in 2010 approved a seven-point plan to reenergize evangelistic efforts. A task force, evaluating how that went, reported this year that only two of the goals were met, and some were quickly forgotten. The task force reported: \u201cRegarding the simple question of whether or not the implementation (of the 2010 plan) reversed the decline of baptisms in the SBC, the answer is a clear and decisive, No.\u201d The report noted \u201ca clear erosion of \u2018trust, transparency and truth\u2019 from within our convention which has ravaged our cooperative work.\u201d Six men are being nominated to succeed Bart Barber, a folksy cattle farmer and small-church pastor, as president. The candidates include five pastors and a seminary dean. As in recent years, the contest will be among candidates with varying degrees of conservativism. Trump will speak virtually at a nearby event on Monday, the day before the annual meeting. That program includes some Southern Baptist leaders. It\u2019s sponsored by an independent group but listed on the SBC calendar of events. Former Vice President Mike Pence will speak Tuesday at a luncheon hosted by the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, but not in the main hall, as he did in 2018. Messengers are expected to vote on resolutions supporting Israel and blaming Hamas amid the Gaza war; recommitting to the abolition of abortion; and urging parents diagnosed with infertility to carefully consider ethical options. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

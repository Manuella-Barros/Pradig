at Yankee Stadium in New York. A person familiar with the negotiations said the Miami Marlins have told Major League Baseball they intend to sign an agreement to sell the team to a group that includes Jeter.\n\nThe Miami Marlins told Major League Baseball they intend to sign an agreement to sell the team to a group that includes the former New York Yankees captain, a person familiar with the negotiations said today.\n\nJeter would be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, said the person, who confirmed the Marlins' plans to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team had not commented.\n\nThe Marlins' months-long sale saga included many twists before owner Jeffrey Loria settled on the popular Jeter, who led the Yankees to five World Series championships before retiring after the 2014 season.\n\nThe person speaking on condition of anonymity said MLB was told Loria's sale price will be about $1.2 billion to the group, which includes more than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who will be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter will be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nJeter, 43, retired after 20 seasons as the Yankees' shortstop. A 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nNow the question is whether Jeter can help the Marlins win.\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since 2003, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market.

the former New York Yankees captain, a person familiar with the negotiations said Friday.\n\nJeter would be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, said the person, who confirmed the Marlins' plans to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team had not commented.\n\nThe Marlins' months-long sale saga included many twists before owner Jeffrey Loria settled on the popular Jeter, who led the Yankees to five World Series championships before retiring after the 2014 season.\n\nThe person speaking on condition of anonymity said MLB was told Loria's sale price will be about $1.2 billion to the group, which includes more than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who will be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter will be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nJeter, 43, retired after 20 seasons as the Yankees' shortstop. A 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nNow the question is whether Jeter can help the Marlins win.\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since 2003, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market. The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelance writer Chris Stock in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve -- Wine", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:07:00Z", "sim": 0.9098039269447327, "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "title": "nwi.com", "id": "1472"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:07:00", "url": "http://www.nwitimes.com/news/national/ap-source-marlins-plan-to-sell-to-group-that-includes/article_bc2368f7-d4d1-528a-a426-c9c20b20a4f9.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8727706", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/b7/fb7e33a2-3cb2-5fec-948d-5a22d3b6f76a/598d18ea05971.image.jpg?crop=512%2C288%2C0%2C37&resize=512%2C288&order=crop%2Cresize", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who will be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter will be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nJeter, 43, retired after 20 seasons as the Yankees' shortstop. A 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nNow the question is whether Jeter can help the Marlins win.\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since 2003, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market.

person familiar with the negotiations said Friday.\n\nJeter would be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, said the person, who confirmed the Marlins' plans to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team had not commented.\n\nThe Marlins' months-long sale saga included many twists before owner Jeffrey Loria settled on the popular Jeter, who led the Yankees to five World Series championships before retiring after the 2014 season.\n\nThe person speaking on condition of anonymity said MLB was told Loria's sale price will be about $1.2 billion to the group, which includes more than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who will be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter will be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nJeter, 43, retired after 20 seasons as the Yankees' shortstop. A 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n''Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,'' Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. ''What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.''\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n''I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,'' Black said. ''A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.''\n\nNow the question is whether Jeter can help the Marlins win.\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since 2003, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a ''confluence of events'' prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market. The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelance writer Chris Stock in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:04:00Z", "sim": 0.9019607901573181, "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "title": "Boston.com", "id": "318"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:20:00", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/mlb/2017/08/11/ap-source-marlins-plan-to-sell-to-group-that-includes-derek-jeter", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8742277", "image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Marlins_Sales_Baseball_74449-850x478.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter will be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\n\"It will be an honor to play for a future Hall of Famer,\" Marlins outfielder Marcell Ozuna said in Spanish after Friday night's win over the Colorado Rockies. \"Hopefully he will bring harmony and winning tradition we have been accustomed of him.\"\n\nThe Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nJeter, 43, retired after 20 seasons as the Yankees' shortstop. A 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nNow the question is whether Jeter can help the Marlins win.\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since 2003, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market. The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelance writers Chris Stock and Santos Perez in Miami contributed to this report.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T06:01:00Z", "sim": 0.8941176533699036, "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "title": "Thegardenisland.com", "id": "11517"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:01:00", "url": "http://thegardenisland.com/business/national-and-international/ap-source-marlins-plan-to-sell-to-group-that-includes/article_3bd52cf5-ad44-5832-ad08-57c7b13a794a.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8750056", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thegardenisland.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/37/f37f29cb-cd59-5114-a405-8200eda28843/598e5e1096dea.image.jpg?resize=512%2C326", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "06:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Marlins told Major League Baseball they intend to sign an agreement to sell the team to a group that includes former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, a person familiar with the negotiations said Friday.\n\nJeter would be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, said the person, who confirmed the Marlins' plans to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team had not commented publicly.\n\nThe person said MLB was told owner Jeffrey Loria's sale price will be about $1.2 billion to the group, which includes more than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who would be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter would be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Sherman-Jeter group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 per cent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nJeter, 43, retired in 2014 after 20 seasons with Yankees. The shortstop and team captain played on five World Series championship teams -- and on the Yankees club that lost to the Marlins in the 2003 World Series.\n\nA 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the post-season since winning the 2003 title, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market.

Loria\n\nOnce again, Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has an agreement in place to sell the franchise to an ownership group that includes Derek Jeter. Jeter and New York venture capitalist Bruce Sherman have reportedly agreed to purchase the club for $1.2 billion. The Marlins and Loria have not confirmed the agreement.\n\nLoria, who is regarded by many as the worst owner in baseball (if not all of sports), has been looking to sell the Marlins for months now. Not surprisingly, it's not until after last month's All-Star Game that a firm sale agreement is in place. Loria reaped all the All-Star Game revenue and now will sell the team. It's what any smart businessman would have done.\n\nHere are seven things to know about the reported sale of the Marlins to the Sherman-Jeter group.\n\n1. The sale is not yet final\n\nThis is important to note, because this is not the first time Jeter has come close to purchasing the Marlins. He and former Florida governor Jeb Bush won the team at auction earlier this year, though they were unable to finalize the sale because they couldn't raise the money. Also, Loria reportedly had a handshake agreement in place to sell the team to a different ownership group over the winter, but that fell apart due to political reasons.\n\nLoria and the Sherman-Jeter group have a sale agreement in place and the money has already been raised. The next step is getting approval from MLB and the other 29 owners. That won't happen for weeks, if not months. That doesn't mean the sale is in danger or anything like that. It just means Loria, Sherman, and Jeter have to wait until the next quarterly owners meetings to get approval. That can take some time.\n\n2. Jeter is not the 'control person'\n\nAccording to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, Jeter is putting only $25 million of his own money into that $1.2 billion purchase price, so he is a minority owner. He will not be the \"control person,\" but he will run the business and baseball operations.\n\nFrom Jackson:\n\nSherman, a wealthy venture capitalist who has a home in New York and is building a home in South Florida, will be the \"control person,\" similar to a managing general partner.\n\nBut Jeter, the former New York Yankees star shortstop, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization, the source said.\n\n...\n\nJeter is believed to be contributing only $25 million of his own money but has a great relationship with Sherman, who will allow Jeter to essentially run the organization.\n\nAlso, Jeter brings unmatched star power and name recognition to the table. He is one of the most popular athletes in the world and that will only enhance the team's brand.\n\n3. Michael Jordan is involved too\n\nAs is often the case, the Sherman-Jeter ownership group includes many small investors. Jeter is, technically, one of those small investors. Another is basketball great Michael Jordan.\n\nFrom Jon Heyman of FanRag Sports:\n\nBeyond Sherman, most of the other members of Jeter's group are smaller investments, with $5 million, $10 million and $20 million increments. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan is mostly lending his name, and is believed to be contributing no more than a few million dollars, if that.\n\nOwning a baseball team is very lucrative -- the revenue sharing system essentially guarantees you'll make money -- so it's not a surprise Jordan and others want a piece of the pie. It's a great investment.\n\n4. Jeter is making history\n\nEven though he's not the \"control person,\" Jeter will be the first African-American to hold his position:\n\nBaseball still has a diversity problem, especially at the front office and ownership level. Surely MLB is hoping Jeter helps spark more diversity hires at upper level positions.\n\n5. The front office is expected to remain in place ...\n\nOnce the sale is final, massive changes are not coming to the Marlins. Several senior level executives are expected to remain in place.\n\nMarlins fans hoping for sweeping change as soon as Loria is out of the picture are likely to be disappointed.\n\n6. ... for now\n\nThat all said, it is very common for new ownership groups to take some time to evaluate the state of the team before making any changes. The Dodgers were sold in March 2012 and it wasn't until October 2014 that the club hired Andrew Friedman away from the Rays to run their baseball operations. These things take time.\n\nNow, just because it took the Dodgers three seasons to change their front office after being sold does not mean the Sherman-Jeter group will wait three seasons to make changes either. They could come in and quickly decide a change in direction is needed. Samson and Hill are staying on, though that should not be considered permanent. At some point the Sherman-Jeter group will want to bring in their own people to run the show.\n\n7. The sale price is the second highest in MLB history\n\nThink the other 29 MLB owners are happy? The reportedly $1.2 billion sale price will be the second largest sum ever paid for a big-league franchise, behind the $2 billion the Guggenheim Partners paid for the Dodgers in March 2012. The Marlins are said to be bleeding money -- they're reportedly going to lose $60 million this year -- yet the franchise is still insanely valuable. If the Marlins are selling for $1.2 billion, imagine what some of the other franchises could fetch.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-03-", "textEnd": 4288, "textStart": 4278, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-10-", "textEnd": 4321, "textStart": 4309}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:46:00Z", "sim": 0.886274516582489, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:46:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/marlins-sale-derek-jeter-bruce-sherman-michael-jordan-and-more-things-to-know/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8720587", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/08/11/b700a65c-08ec-42cd-817a-dd88dd21fcba/thumbnail/770x433/cb24a637016effd90e30882a8e8f68df/usatsi-10058040.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

agreement to sell the team to a group that includes former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, a person familiar with the negotiations said Friday.\n\nJeter would be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, said the person, who confirmed the Marlins' plans to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team had not commented publicly.\n\nThe person said MLB was told owner Jeffrey Loria's sale price will be about $1.2 billion to the group, which includes more than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who would be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter would be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Sherman-Jeter group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nJeter, 43, retired in 2014 after 20 seasons with Yankees. The shortstop and team captain played on five World Series championship teams -- and on the Yankees club that lost to the Marlins in the 2003 World Series.\n\nA 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since winning the 2003 title, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market. The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelancer Chris Stock in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve -- Wine", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:14:00Z", "sim": 0.8823529481887817, "source": {"uri": "postbulletin.com", "title": "PostBulletin.com", "id": "3887"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:14:00", "url": "http://www.postbulletin.com/business/ap-source-marlins-plan-to-sell-to-group-that-includes/article_338b8c5d-3e0a-5f70-9331-f60590dd32cb.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8723258", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postbulletin.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/85/7852b121-58fc-5593-9cf4-ef8c241f668e/598e469e4b017.image.jpg?crop=435%2C326%2C38%2C0&resize=435%2C326&order=crop%2Cresize", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

has agreed to sell the franchise for $1.2 billion to a group led by New York businessman Bruce Sherman and former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, and Major League Baseball is expected to receive the written agreement on Friday, according to a New York based MLB source.\n\nSherman, 69, a wealthy venture capitalist who has a home in New York and is building a home in South Florida, will be the \"control person,\" similar to a managing general partner.\n\nBut Jeter, the former New York Yankees star shortstop, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization, the source said.\n\nThe Sherman/Jeter group has about 16 investors and they have raised the money to purchase the team after months of seeking investors to meet Loria's asking price, the source said.\n\nAmong the other investors: former NBA star Michael Jordan, who's a friend of Jeter.\n\nA purchase agreement with the Sherman/Jeter group, which has been worked on for months, is expected to be completed on Friday and submitted to MLB offices in New York.\n\nSherman, a Marlins fan, is known for his philanthropic work and previously was the chairman and chief investment officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nSherman increased his investment in the Marlins bid after wealthy Chicago businessman Richard Chaifetz backed out of the deal.\n\nJeter is believed to be contributing only $25 million of his own money but has a great relationship with Sherman, who will allow Jeter to essentially run the organization.\n\nMLB officials are expected to discuss the sale, but not vote on it, in owners meetings in Chicago next week.

"body": "Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the franchise for $1.2 billion to a group led by New York businessman Bruce Sherman and former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, and Major League Baseball is expected to receive the written agreement on Friday, according to a New York based MLB source.\n\nSherman, a wealthy venture capitalist who has a home in New York and is building a home in South Florida, will be the \"control person,\" similar to a managing general partner.\n\nBut Jeter, the former New York Yankees star shortstop, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization, the source said.\n\nThe Sherman/Jeter group has about 16 investors and they have raised the money to purchase the team after months of seeking investors to meet Loria's asking price, the source said.\n\nA purchase agreement with the Sherman/Jeter group, which has been worked on for months, is expected to be completed on Friday and submitted to MLB offices in New York.\n\nSherman, a Marlins fan, is known for his philanthropic work and previously was the chairman and chief investment officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nSherman increased his investment in the Marlins bid after wealthy Chicago businessman Richard Chaifetz backed out of the deal.\n\nJeter is believed to be contributing only $25 million of his own money but has a great relationship with Sherman, who will allow Jeter to essentially run the organization.\n\nMLB officials are expected to discuss the sale, but not vote on it, in owners meetings in Chicago next week. Sherman and possibly Jeter are expected to meet with the ownership committee prior for a full vote of owners, which is the final required step for the sale's completion.\n\nThe vote could be weeks away, with closing expected the first week of October.\n\nMiami businessman Jorge Mas also pursued the team and met with Marlins officials this week but did not match the $1.2 billion bid of the Sherman and Jeter group.\n\nNew York businessman Wayne Rothbaum, who led a competing group that included former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, also bid for the Marlins, before stopping his pursuit earlier this week.\n\nLoria has owned the team since 2002 and won a World Series in 2003, but the Marlins haven't made the playoffs since then, the second-longest postseason drought in Major League Baseball behind the Seattle Mariners.\n\nThe Marlins are expected to lose more than $60 million this season, according to a source who has seen their books, in part because their revenues are among the lowest in MLB and in part because their $115 million payroll is the largest in franchise history.\n\nThe Marlins' TV contracts pays the lowest of any team in MLB, and Marlins attendance traditionally ranks among the bottom five in MLB.\n\nLoria decided to sell the team for personal reasons and had been seeking a buyer for months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson on Friday declined to comment about where the sales process stood.\n\nBusinessobserver.com refers to Sherman as \"the shrewd Naples investor who posted spectacular investment returns for years before the financial crisis and a bet on Bear Stearns blemished an otherwise stellar track record. Sherman's investing style is to select companies he thinks are undervalued.\"\n\nJeter, meanwhile, would give the Marlins cachet and a former player universally respected in baseball.\n\nJeter, 42, played his entire 20-year career with the Yankees before retiring after the 2014 season and was one of the most celebrated, heavily marketed and distinguished players of his era.\n\nHe was a 14-time All-Star, won five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger awards, two Hank Aaron Awards and is the Yankees' all-time career leader in hits (3,465), doubles (544), games played (2,747), stolen bases (358), times on base (4,716) and at-bats (11,195).\n\nJeter became the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits and finished his career sixth all-time in career hits and the all-time MLB leader in hits by a shortstop.\n\nHe consistently ranked among the American League leaders in hits and runs scored for most of his career, and served as the Yankees' team captain from 2003 until his retirement in 2014.\n\nJeter won five World Series (1996, 1998 through 2000 and 2009) and holds many postseason records.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8705882430076599, "source": {"uri": "heraldnet.com", "title": "HeraldNet.com", "id": "10395"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:28:00", "url": "http://www.heraldnet.com/sports/source-jeters-ownership-group-to-by-marlins-for-1-2-billion/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8729643", "image": "http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heraldnet_logo.png", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

agreement to sell the team to a group that includes former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, a person familiar with the negotiations said Friday.\n\nJeter would be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, said the person, who confirmed the Marlins' plans to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team had not commented publicly.\n\nThe person said MLB was told owner Jeffrey Loria's sale price will be about $1.2 billion to the group, which includes more than 10 entities.\n\nAmong them is Sherman, who would be the controlling owner, the person said. Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nJeter would be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Sherman-Jeter group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nJeter, 43, retired in 2014 after 20 seasons with Yankees. The shortstop and team captain played on five World Series championship teams - and on the Yankees club that lost to the Marlins in the 2003 World Series.\n\nA 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game - that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since winning the 2003 title, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market. The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n---\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelancer Chris Stock in Miami contributed to this report.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:40:00Z", "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "963"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:45:00", "url": "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BBN_MARLINS_SALE_FLOL-?SITE=ORCOO&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8720538", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Sherman has spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nJeter would be in charge of baseball operations, said the person, who added the Marlins told MLB they intended to sign the sale agreement Friday night.\n\nThe Sherman-Jeter group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations. One group was led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, and another included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently halted his pursuit of a deal.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said a month ago that all three groups offered about the same amount of money, but there were legal and financing issues that slowed the process. Jeter had trouble raising money as he sought additional investors.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry, who was part of a group that bought the Boston Red Sox.\n\nMLB owners meet next week in Chicago. A sale requires approval of at least 75 percent of the major league clubs, and the approval process could take three to six months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment Friday.\n\nSEC warns TSP participants of new scam\n\nJeter, 43, retired in 2014 after 20 seasons with Yankees. The shortstop and team captain played on five World Series championship teams -- and on the Yankees club that lost to the Marlins in the 2003 World Series.\n\nA 14-time All-Star, Jeter lives in Tampa and has long talked of his desire to own a franchise. He has no front office experience.\n\nSherman is known for his philanthropic work and retired in 2009 as chief executive officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, said he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said before Friday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nThe value of the Marlins has climbed dramatically even though they haven't been to the postseason since winning the 2003 title, the longest current drought in the National League, and are likely to miss the playoffs again this year. They were last in the NL in attendance 11 of the past 12 years despite a 2012 move to Marlins Park.\n\nLoria is perhaps baseball's most unpopular owner. He has long been criticized in South Florida for his frugal ways and for the ballpark deal, which was heavily subsidized with public money.\n\nHis decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest became public in April.\n\nAt the start of spring training, Samson said a \"confluence of events\" prompted Loria to put the franchise on the market. The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelancer Chris Stock in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:53:00Z", "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "source": {"uri": "federalnewsradio.com", "title": "Federal News Radio", "id": "9518"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:53:00", "url": "https://federalnewsradio.com/sports-news/2017/08/ap-source-marlins-plan-to-sell-to-group-that-includes-jeter/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8721349", "image": "https://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Marlins_Nationals_Baseball_15214.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:53:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

a conclusion.\n\nOwner Jeffrey Loria agreed Friday to sell the team for $1.2 billion to a group headed by New York businessman Bruce Sherman and highlighted by New York Yankees legend Derek Jeter, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe deal is not final yet, and likely won't be for months. It will need approval from 21 of the other 29 major league team owners.\n\nThe Marlins and Major League Baseball, through spokespeople, declined to comment.\n\nA purchase agreement was expected to be submitted to MLB on Friday, according to the Miami Herald. Fox Business reported that Loria and Sherman/Jeter have a \"handshake deal.\" In April, Loria reached an agreement in principle with a group including Jeter and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but that deal was not completed.\n\nSherman, 69, will be the new ownership group's control person, while Jeter, 43, will run the business and baseball operations departments, the Herald reported. Jeter is said to be investing only $25 million of his own money.\n\nThe Sherman/Jeter group beat out South Florida billionaire Jorge Mas, who bid a reported $1.17 billion. A third group, led by Quague Capital founder Wayne Rothbaum and Bush, had been quieter over the past month-plus and reportedly dropped out of the running completely this week.\n\nJeter, who lives in Tampa, has long expressed a desire to own a major league team, but that his group is so close to winning is something of an underdog story. He has been involved with the bidding since the process began, but his ever-shifting group of investors has been hit by key defections, including that of Chicago billionaire Richard Chaifetz last month and Bush in late May.\n\nJeter's group is comprised of 16 investors, including NBA legend and Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan, according to the Herald. Jordan and Jeter have been friends\n\nSherman previously headed the Naples-based Private Capital Management. He retired in 2009.\n\nJeter won five World Series championships in his 20 years playing shortstop for the Yankees. He was briefly teammates with and then coached by current Marlins manager Don Mattingly.\n\nOn Friday at Marlins Park, Mattingly spoke glowingly but in generalities about Jeter.\n\n\"Derek has been successful in everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said. \"Good people with the kind of ability that he had as a player, that translates into business just like it does just like it does to anything else. I think that foundation, hard work, determination, confidence, all those things lead you to believe that Derek is going to be successful at whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nThis is brings closer to an end a soap opera that has dragged on from the early days of spring training, when club president David Samson the team was officially for sale, through the spring, when multiple other groups were reportedly closing in on buying the team, and past Miami's All-Star Game last month, when Mas seemed to emerge as a late favorite.\n\nBut all along, Loria -- known to fancy Yankees stars, including Mattingly -- seemed to favor Jeter, allowing him months to recruit the needed financial support.\n\nLoria, who previously owned the Montreal Expos, bought the Marlins for $158 million in 2002. The Marlins won the World Series in 2003, but haven't returned to the playoffs since and last had a winning season in 2009.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:40:00Z", "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "title": "Orlando Sentinel", "id": "883"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:40:00", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/fl-reg-loria-agrees-to-sell-marlines-20170811-story.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8706351", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598e230b/turbine/fl-reg-loria-agrees-to-sell-marlines-20170811", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The owner was close to pitcher Jose Fernandez and badly shaken by the young ace's death in a boat crash last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and AP freelancer Chris Stock in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:00:00Z", "sim": 0.8627451062202454, "source": {"uri": "kiro7.com", "title": "KIRO", "id": "1082"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:00:00", "url": "http://www.kiro7.com/sports/ap-source-marlins-plan-to-sell-to-group-that-includes-jeter/588927664", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8722071", "image": "https://cmgfeeds.cmgdigital.com/photo/2017/08/11/Marlins_Nationals_Baseball_15214_8834692_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Word got out Friday that a group led by future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter and New York venture capitalist Bruce Sherman have reached an agreement to purchase the team. The reported sale price is $1.3 billion. It should be noted the sale is not final. They still need to get approval from MLB and work out other details.\n\nAccording to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, Sherman will have controlling interest in the Marlins, meaning Jeter will be a minority owner. Here are some more details:\n\nSherman, a wealthy venture capitalist who has a home in New York and is building a home in South Florida, will be the \"control person,\" similar to a managing general partner.\n\nBut Jeter, the former New York Yankees star shortstop, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization, the source said.\n\nJeter, 42, made it no secret later in his playing career that he would like to one day own a team. He'll now get the opportunity to do exactly that with the Marlins even though he won't be the \"control person,\" per Jackson's report.\n\nSo the question becomes what does Jeter bring to the table as an owner? He's never owned a team before or worked in a front office, so this will all be new to him. And until you see someone out there doing it, it's impossible to know how exactly they will respond.\n\nThere is one thing Jeter will unquestionably bring the Marlins: star power and name recognition. I suppose that's two things, but you know what I mean. Jeter is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world, and while he won't be on the field daily, he will be associated with the franchise, and that is nothing but a positive for the Marlins.\n\nJeter's role figures to be very similar to Magic Johnson's role with the Dodgers. Johnson is a minority owner with the Dodgers -- the Guggenheim Partners own controlling interest in the team -- but he is essentially the face of the ownership group. He's at all the press conferences and on-field ceremonies. Why? Because, like Jeter, he is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.\n\nIt's unclear how the Marlins will structure their front office under the Sherman-Jeter group, and that situation may not become clear for months. Jeter grew up under George Steinbrenner, the most meddlesome of owners. Will he take a similar approach with the Marlins or be more hands-off?\n\nJeter certainly knows baseball. Does he know how to evaluate talent and interpret statistical data, though? That's different than playing shortstop.\n\nAny baseball knowledge Jeter brings to the table is a plus. His main function with the Marlins will be adding legitimacy and star power to an ownership group that inevitably will be more popular than Jeffrey Loria. Loria is that despised in South Florida. Sherman may be the one calling the shots, but Jeter is the one who will be front and center representing the Marlins once the sale is final.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:46:00Z", "sim": 0.8627451062202454, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:46:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/derek-jeter-brings-big-time-star-power-to-the-marlins-new-ownership-group/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8720592", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2016/07/06/5105ccda-53b5-4e3d-b4a7-d505591f0fab/thumbnail/770x433/a318518d3a2a63f6acb599195d610565/usatsi8824951-jeter.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

USA TODAY Sports\n\nJeffrey Loria, the soon-to-be-former owner of the Miami Marlins, has always loved the New York Yankees.\n\nIt's his favorite team.\n\nHe goes to games at Yankee Stadium.\n\nHe lives in New York.\n\nHe collects art there.\n\nHighest bidder: Jeter-led group agrees to buy Marlins for $1.2 billion\n\nAnd ever since he decided to sell the Marlins, he's always wanted the franchise to go to Derek Jeter.\n\nSo he waited.\n\nThe Jeb Bush group came and went. The Mitt Romney group disappeared. New York businessman Wayne Rothbaum bowed out. Miami businessman Jorge Mas jumped in late, but didn't come up with the money.\n\nSo Loria waited, and waited, and finally, with New York businessman Bruce Sherman joining Jeter's group, they came up with the minimum price Loria desired at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe deal was finalized Friday, a high-ranking executive with direct knowledge of the sale confirmed to USA TODAY Sports, but spoke only on the condition of anonymity, since the proposed sale has yet to be presented to Major League Baseball.\n\nSherman will be the control person. Jeter will be the baseball and business man, and everyone in the MLB offices on Park Avenue in N.Y. are ecstatic.\n\nJeter, one of the iconic names in all of baseball, with five World Series rings and a 14-time All-Star, is back in the game and immediately becomes the most famous face in baseball's ownership circles, supplanting minority owner Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nSure, Jeter is only putting in about $25 million of his own cash.\n\nYes, Jeter has zero front office experience.\n\nAnd, yes, the team is in financial disarray, with projected losses of at least $60 million this season while the team already is in about $500 million of debt.\n\nYet, there finally is hope that the Marlins will be a valuable franchise again, knowing that whatever Jeter has touched, whether it's his Yankee teams, his brands, or even his website, has turned to gold.\n\nThe news of the sale will surely dominate the MLB owners' meetings next week in Chicago, but no vote will be taken. Sherman and Jeter still have to meet with the ownership committee, there will be a recommendation, and finally a vote.\n\nThe deal should be finalized in October, far too late to save this season, but in plenty of time to save the franchise.\n\nIt's a happy day in Florida, and throughout the game of baseball.\n\nJeter is back.\n\nAnd, just maybe, so are the Marlins.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook\n\nGALLERY: Derek Jeter; Yankees legend\n\nAutoplay\n\nShow Thumbnails\n\nShow Captions\n\nLast SlideNext Slide", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:48:00Z", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "source": {"uri": "standardrepublic.com", "title": "Standard Republic", "id": "18909"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:58:00", "url": "http://www.standardrepublic.com/2017/08/co-owner-derek-jeter-a-perfect-fit-to-run-the-miami-marlins/21319.htm", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8755083", "image": "http://www.standardrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/636380670485379851-USP-MLB-HOUSTON-ASTROS-AT-NEW-YORK-YANKEES-90911770.JPG", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:48:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

"body": "Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the franchise for $1.2 billion to a group led by New York businessman Bruce Sherman and former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, and Major League Baseball is expected to receive the written agreement on Friday, according to a New York based MLB source.\n\nSherman, a wealthy venture capitalist who has a home in New York and is building a home in South Florida, will be the \"control person,\" similar to a managing general partner.\n\nBut Jeter, the former New York Yankees star shortstop, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization, the source said.\n\nThe Sherman/Jeter group has about 16 investors and they have raised the money to purchase the team after months of seeking investors to meet Loria's asking price, the source said.\n\nA purchase agreement with the Sherman/Jeter group, which has been worked on for months, is expected to be completed on Friday and submitted to MLB offices in New York.\n\nSherman, a Marlins fan, is known for his philanthropic work and previously was the chairman and chief investment officer of Naples-based Private Capital Management.\n\nSherman increased his investment in the Marlins bid after wealthy Chicago businessman Richard Chaifetz backed out of the deal.\n\nJeter is believed to be contributing only $25 million of his own money but has a great relationship with Sherman, who will allow Jeter to essentially run the organization.\n\nMLB officials are expected to discuss the sale, but not vote on it, in owners meetings in Chicago next week. Sherman and possibly Jeter are expected to meet with the ownership committee prior for a full vote of owners, which is the final required step for the sale's completion.\n\nThe vote could be weeks away, with closing expected the first week of October.\n\nMiami businessman Jorge Mas also pursued the team and met with Marlins officials this week but did not match the $1.2 billion bid of the Sherman and Jeter group.\n\nNew York businessman Wayne Rothbaum, who led a competing group that included former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, also bid for the Marlins, before stopping his pursuit earlier this week.\n\nLoria has owned the team since 2002 and won a World Series in 2003, but the Marlins haven't made the playoffs since then, the second-longest postseason drought in Major League Baseball behind the Seattle Mariners.\n\nThe Marlins are expected to lose more than $60 million this season, according to a source who has seen their books, in part because their revenues are among the lowest in MLB and in part because their $115 million payroll is the largest in franchise history.\n\nThe Marlins' TV contracts pays the lowest of any team in MLB, and Marlins attendance traditionally ranks among the bottom five in MLB.\n\nLoria decided to sell the team for personal reasons and had been seeking a buyer for months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson on Friday declined to comment about where the sales process stood.\n\nBusinessobserver.com refers to Sherman as \"the shrewd Naples investor who posted spectacular investment returns for years before the financial crisis and a bet on Bear Stearns blemished an otherwise stellar track record. Sherman's investing style is to select companies he thinks are undervalued.\"\n\nJeter, meanwhile, would give the Marlins cachet and a former player universally respected in baseball.\n\nJeter, 42, played his entire 20-year career with the Yankees before retiring after the 2014 season and was one of the most celebrated, heavily marketed and distinguished players of his era.\n\nHe was a 14-time All-Star, won five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger awards, two Hank Aaron Awards and is the Yankees' all-time career leader in hits (3,465), doubles (544), games played (2,747), stolen bases (358), times on base (4,716) and at-bats (11,195).\n\nJeter became the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits and finished his career sixth all-time in career hits and the all-time MLB leader in hits by a shortstop.\n\nHe consistently ranked among the American League leaders in hits and runs scored for most of his career, and served as the Yankees' team captain from 2003 until his retirement in 2014.\n\nJeter won five World Series (1996, 1998 through 2000 and 2009) and holds many postseason records.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:15:00Z", "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "title": "Boston Herald", "id": "2238"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:15:00", "url": "http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/2017/08/loria_agrees_to_sell_marlins_to_sherman_and_jeter_source_says", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8702681", "image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/ap/2017/05/14/bc7e9b41806740668a0ca1a8d3df364d.jpg?itok=TT_2364R", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

According to a report from The Miami Herald, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the team to the group that includes Derek Jeter and New York businessman Bruce Sherman for a cool $1.2 billion.\n\nThe group including Jeter was long expected to be a favorite to land the ownership of the Marlins, although concerns about potentially not having as much to offer for the team was thought to hold back the Jeter group from winning the bidding war. A healthy relationship and respect Loria has for Jeter made the Jeter group one of the top contenders from the start. Jeter reportedly is expected to be putting up $25 million for his ownership stake, which makes him a mere part owner of the team, but it would be wise for the Marlins to put his face in front of as many fans as possible to build a connection with them.\n\nOne other serious bidder, Miami businessman Jorge Mas, made a serious push to buy the team but was unwilling or unable to match the $1.2 billion bid put up by Sherman and Jeter's group. The bidding group that included former Florida Governor Jeb Bush backed out of the bidding process this week.\n\nThe sale of the team, of course, has not been finalized, and there are a few more steps in the process before we can formally recognize \"The Captain\" of the New York Yankees as an official owner in baseball circles. Aside from the legalities of the sale having to be ironed out, Major League Baseball must also approve the sale to the Sherman/Jeter group. But you would think Major League Baseball would never say no to Jeter, so as long as all of the paperwork can be sorted out between Loria and the winning bidders, this sale will easily be approved by the rest of Major League Baseball's owners.\n\nInterestingly enough, the Jeter group consists of 16 bidders. Among them is Michael Jordan. No word on whether or not Jordan will attempt to come out of retirement to take a few more swings in the batting cage.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:17:00Z", "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "title": "The Comeback", "id": "14909"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:53:00", "url": "http://thecomeback.com/mlb/marlins-reportedly-being-sold-to-derek-jeters-bidding-group.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8731517", "image": "http://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/683114084.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

That includes the annual Sherman Prize, a pair of $100,000 awards that honor achievements of those leading the fight against Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Sherman's late father had Crohn's, as do two daughters.\n\nThe Shermans also organize the annual Naples Winter Wine Festival, which has raised more than $161 million for the Naples Children & Education Foundation since 2001.\n\nJeter, who lives in Tampa, has long expressed a desire to own a major league team, but that his group is so close to winning is something of an underdog story. He has been involved with the bidding since the process began, but his ever-shifting group of investors has been hit by key defections, including that of Chicago billionaire Richard Chaifetz last month and Bush in late May.\n\nJeter's current group is comprised of 16 investors, including NBA legend and Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan, according to the Herald. Jordan and Jeter have long been friends.\n\nJeter won five World Series championships in his 20 years playing shortstop for the Yankees. He was briefly teammates with and then coached by current Marlins manager Don Mattingly.\n\nOn Friday at Marlins Park, Mattingly spoke glowingly but in generalities about Jeter, saying he was unaware of any sale deal.\n\n\"Derek has been successful in everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said. \"Good people with the kind of ability that he had as a player, that translates into business just like it does just like it does to anything else. I think that foundation, hard work, determination, confidence, all those things lead you to believe that Derek is going to be successful at whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nThis appears to bring closer to an end a soap opera that has dragged on from the early days of spring training, when club president David Samson said the team was officially for sale. The process continued through the spring, when multiple other groups were reportedly closing in on buying the team, and past baseball's All-Star Game in Miami last month, when Mas seemed to emerge as a late favorite.\n\nA third bidding group, led by Quogue Capital founder Wayne Rothbaum and Bush, had been quieter over the past month-plus and reportedly dropped out of the running completely this week.\n\nBut all along, Loria -- a New York native known to fancy Yankees stars, including Mattingly -- seemed to favor Jeter, allowing him months to recruit the needed financial support.\n\nLoria, who previously owned the Montreal Expos, bought the Marlins for $158 million in 2002. The Marlins won the World Series in 2003 but haven't returned to the playoffs since, and they last had a winning season in 2009.\n\nStaff writers Dave Hyde and Craig Davis contributed to this report.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "title": "The Baltimore Sun", "id": "597"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:28:00", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/mlb/fl-reg-loria-agrees-to-sell-marlines-20170811-story.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8718876", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598e3b4d/turbine/fl-reg-loria-agrees-to-sell-marlines-20170811", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

It will need approval from 21 of the other 29 major league team owners.\n\nThe Marlins and Major League Baseball, through spokesmen, declined to comment.\n\nJorge Mas, the other primary bidder for the team, has not been officially notified of Loria's agreement with the Sherman/Jeter group, a source close to Mas told the Sun Sentinel on Friday evening. The source said Mas met with MLB officials on Thursday and laid out his group's financing, including investors. Mas was not willing to offer as much as $1.2 billion, according to the source.\n\nA purchase agreement between Loria and the Sherman/Jeter group was expected to be submitted to MLB on Friday, according to the Miami Herald. Fox Business reported that Loria and Sherman/Jeter have a \"handshake deal.\" In April, Loria reached an agreement in principle to sell the team to a group including Jeter and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but that deal was not completed.\n\nSherman, 69, will be the new ownership group's control person, while Jeter, 43, will run the business and baseball operations departments, the Herald reported.

Sherman, who retired from finance, is a Florida resident.\n\nOne potential hurdle, among a few for Jeter, is that he seeks to be the control person, and other owners have suggested that his expected $25 million investment does not qualify him as a control person; of course, Jeter carries cache for his playing record and image, and they could potentially get around that by listing Sherman as the control person, and giving Jeter significant power though technically not control.\n\nAnother issue could be a side deal for the Jeter group with Michael Dell, which is suspected to be tantamount to a loan at a high (14 percent) rate of interest. That wouldn't likely fly with MLB.\n\nMas is a billionaire, but since MLB requires 40 percent financing, and the team is losing money (it's expected to be close to $70 million in the red this year), like Jeter he has been seeking extra investors.\n\nWhile Mas, a well-respected Miami businessman, would be cheered in the community if he were to get the team, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria and president David Samson are said to much prefer Jeter as the owner, which is one reason the Wayne Rothbaum-Jeb Bush group recently dropped out, as FanRag Sports first reported.\n\nSamson declined comment on where the negotiations currently stand.\n\nRelated Items:FRS News, Miami Marlins, Todays MLB News", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T14:52:00Z", "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "source": {"uri": "fanragsports.com", "title": "FanRag Sports", "id": "16930"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:12:00", "url": "https://www.fanragsports.com/news/heyman-jeter-gets-boost-two-group-derby-buy-marlins/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8717126", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/29013540/AP_17135006385682.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "14:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The big question all along has not been whether Jeter and Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, who has preferred Jeter by all accounts, could agree; it is whether the Jeter group's financing is solid.\n\nThere is also the matter of whether Sherman ultimately wants control.\n\nIt's possible Sherman could become the listed control person with Jeter taking an even more active role than his expected title of CEO would suggest. Or Sherman could find someone else to be the control guy. There are said to be about five or six main investors on their team, though Sherman could try to find someone else to take the lead role, if he so chooses.\n\nIt isn't known if he might consider recruiting Jorge Mas, the well-respected Miami businessman, who looks to be the second-place finisher in this derby.\n\nThe Miami Herald first reported there was agreement.\n\nWord is that Jeter has long been the favorite of not only Loria but also team president David Samson. While Samson has said that his own job was not to be part of the negotiations, Jeter has made known that he's willing to keep Samson on in a role. There is said to be a little over a year left on Samson's contract.\n\nBaseball president and general manager Michael Hill is expected to be asked to stay on, though other groups would have likely kept him, too.\n\nOne thing someone connected to the Jeter group has suggested will likely go: the home run sculpture in left-centerfield that was designed by the artist Red Grooms and has been the subject of controversy.\n\nIt should also be noted that, because of the timing of the agreement, there will not be enough time for the other 29 MLB owners to approve any deal at next week's owners meeting, though that hurdle does eventually need to be cleared.\n\nRelated Items:FRS News, Miami Marlins, NL East, Todays MLB News FanRag Sports Daily MLB Newsletter", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:04:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "fanragsports.com", "title": "FanRag Sports", "id": "16930"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:20:00", "url": "https://www.fanragsports.com/mlb/marlins/heyman-jeter-group-finalizing-deal-purchase-marlins/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8742279", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21133152/95316052924_Braves-Marlins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

NBA legend Michael Jordan also is among the 16 investors in the group.\n\nThe sale requires the approval of at least 23 of the 30 MLB owners. They'll discuss the Marlins next week in Chicago at a meeting but aren't likely to vote on the matter for another few weeks. They're expected to ratify the sale some time in October.\n\nLoria announced in March his intention to sell the team. Several groups were interested, but the Jeter-Sherman team beat out two other rivals in the final weeks of negotiations.\n\nJeter, 43, will use just $25 million of his own money to buy a stake in the Marlins.

Ellis said. \"That really is the only thing you need to know, that his commitment and desire to win and everything he did as a player was directed to winning that game and leading his team toward a championship. You can only anticipate that will be his daily expectation here.\"\n\nMarlins president David Samson confirmed Saturday that an agreement was signed about 11:30 p.m. Friday and submitted to Major League Baseball for a group headed by Jeter and Sherman, a retired money manager to purchase the team from Jeffrey Loria.\n\nThe transaction will be reviewed by the ownership committee next week in Chicago, with a target of being voted on in September and a closing by early October. It will require approval from 21 of the other 29 owners.\n\nAccording to numerous reports, the sale price was $1.2 billion. The Jeter-Sherman group outbid two other groups, including one headed by Miami businessman Jorge Mas.\n\n\"The only thing I'll add right now is we feel really good,\" Samson said. \"It was made because we thought it was in the best interest of the franchise to go forward at this time with this group.\n\n\"Bruce Sherman truly is a man who has a passion for baseball and a love of baseball. Derek Jeter is an incredibly capable individual. Forget what he did on the field, he's incredibly capable off the field,\" Samson continued. \"Thinking about what it would mean for our community and our fans, it just made the most sense.\"\n\nSamson said Mas has not joined with Jeter's group, contrary to media reports, and will not be a partner in the agreement that owners will consider in the coming weeks.\n\nA source close to Mas told the Sun Sentinel that Mas has been talking to Sherman and there is a \"better than not chance\" of him joining the group.\n\nMarlins players had not yet been told of the agreement, but there was eagerness in the clubhouse for the matter to be concluded.\n\n\"If that's the case, it's exciting,\" center fielder Christian Yelich said. \"[Jeter] was my favorite player growing up. So to be playing in the organization that he is a potential owner of is exciting.\n\n\"As a player you want to know the direction that you're headed as an organization. I feel like we've kind of been at a standstill this year. To know which way it's going to be will be nice to know. A lot of stuff hasn't been able to happen or can't happen until the new ownership [is in place].\"\n\nSamson confirmed that Sherman, 69, will be the new ownership group's control person, while Jeter, 43, will become the first African-American to head operations of a team in MLB. The former shortstop is believed to be investing $25 million of his own money.\n\nSherman, a Naples resident, headed the Naples-based Private Capital Management before retiring in 2009.\n\nJeter, who lives in Tampa, has expressed an interest in owning a major league team since retiring as a player in 2014. He has been involved throughout the bidding process for the Marlins, beginning early this year, but with an ever-changing group of investors.\n\nJeter's current group is comprised of 16 investors, including NBA legend and Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan.\n\n\"I'm a little more pumped that Michael Jordan's in the group than Jeter,\" quipped closer Brad Ziegler, who allowed one hit in five at-bats to Jeter.\n\nEllis was with the Los Angeles Dodgers through the protracted sage of then-owner Frank McCourt's divorce that led to bankruptcy and ultimately sale of the team to the Guggenheim Group in 2012.\n\nDue to his experience in LA, Ellis said some Marlins teammates have sought his counsel about what to expect as the saga of a potential sale that began in spring training dragged on.\n\n\"Usually when these transactions happen it's very positive because the new ownership will come in and inject new energy and new life and new resources and try to make this the best place it can be,\" Ellis said.\n\nThat has certainly been the case for the Dodgers, who have won several division titles under new ownership and have the best record in baseball this season. They also have the backing of resources in the nation's second-largest market that are not present in Miami, notably a lucrative regional TV deal.\n\nAt this point, what type of leadership and direction Jeter and Sherman will take the Marlins is unknown.\n\n\"When you have someone as decorated as Derek is as player, you just know that same passion and energy is going to transition to his new role,\" Ellis said. \"You can tell he's very meticulous in his decision-making. He's identified that this is a place that can become a winner very quickly, which is very encouraging for all the guys in this clubhouse to know.\"\n\nThe Marlins haven't reached the playoffs since 2003, when they won their second World Series, and haven't had a winning season since 2009.\n\nAmong many questions to be answered is Samson's future with the team. He said that hasn't been determined but that he is open to working with the new owners, saying, \" I have never discussed my status. It's not about me.\"\n\nLoria has not addressed his future plans. He was cited earlier this year as a candidate to become the U.S. ambassador to France. He was an unpopular figure during his 18 years running the Marlins, but Samson said Loria will leave behind a positive legacy.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, the stadium that Jeffrey got built is what guaranteed the future of the Marlins,\" Samson said. \"Having this beautiful ballpark.

Sherman had agreed to put up $400 million to secure approval from MLB officials.\n\nThe former New York Yankees captain and his partners won the Major League Baseball team with a bid of $1.2 billion, a deal that was first reported by the Miami Herald. The offer was chosen by Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria over a lower bid from Mas.\n\nGetting Mas, a Cuban-American entrepreneur, would be a win for MLB, adding an owner with not only deep pockets but strong local roots. The deal requires approval from MLB owners.\n\nRepresentatives for Jeter and Loria didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Mas declined to comment.\n\nThe sale ends Loria's controversial reign in South Florida. Loria bought the team in 2002 for $158 million, and the next year, the Marlins won the World Series. They haven't made the playoffs since, and Loria alienated fans by threatening to move the team to secure public funding for Marlins Park and selling off players to minimize the cost of the team's losses. In 2012, a Miami Herald poll put his favorability rating at 6 percent.\n\n\"The people of Miami are happy to have a new ownership group,\" said Carlos Gimenez, mayor of Miami-Dade County. \"I hope there are no holdovers. It would be a mistake for him to start that way,\" he said, referring to Jeter.\n\nSherman, a co-founder and former chairman of Legg Mason Inc.'s Private Capital Management, was poised to become the team's managing partner, according to the earlier Herald report. Jeter, who is contributing $25 million, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization. NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan is also part of the group.\n\nThey're getting a team that hasn't had a winning record since 2009. The Marlins are currently in last place in the National League East. Despite a relatively new stadium, attendance is consistently among the lowest in baseball -- so far in 2017, the team's average attendance of 20,796 ranks 28th among 30 teams.\n\nThough the team is losing money, the next ownership group will reap the benefits of a new naming rights deal for the stadium. Team executives have also said they're exploring a reworked local television contract. The current deal with Fox expires after the 2020 season. According to the Miami Herald, the team gets about $20 million a year from Fox, the lowest in baseball.\n\nThis is the second time a Jeter-led bid has won an auction for the Miami franchise. The sale process began in February when Loria came close to a deal with the Kushner family, relatives by marriage to President Donald Trump. In April, Jeter and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush submitted a $1.3 billion offer that was accepted by Loria, though the group was unable to raise enough money to complete the transaction.\n\nAs Jeter pursued a new bid group, other prospective bidders, including Bush, Quogue Capital founder Wayne Rothbaum and Mitt Romney's son, Tagg, pursued their own groups, occasionally teaming up on potential bids. In the end, the Jeter and Mas groups were the only ones left.\n\nAll team sales are subject to approval by MLB. As a 14-time All Star and career Yankee, Jeter isn't expected to have trouble getting the blessing of the league. He's sixth on baseball's all-time hits list (3,465) and a shoo-in to join the Hall of Fame when he's eligible in 2020.\n\nSince retiring, Jeter, 43, has helped launch a handful of business ventures, including The Players Tribune, a publication that features first-person stories by athletes.

Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSE\n\nA group headlined by Derek Jeter is nearing a deal to buy the Miami Marlins for $1.2 billion, according to a report from the New York Post. Time_Sports\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nDerek Jeter is about to become a co-owner of the Miami Marlins. And there is a Naples connection.\n\nMarlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the franchise for $1.2 billion to the New York Yankees legend and his group led by New York businessman and longtime Naples resident Bruce Sherman, a person directly involved with the sale confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the sale is not complete.\n\nThe Miami Herald was the first to report the Sherman-Jeter group was in agreement with Loria. Hall of Fame basketball star Michael Jordan is also said to part of the investors.\n\nThe Herald reported that Sherman is a Marlins fan, and the increased his investment in the group after Chicago businessman Richard Chaifetz backed out, and that Jeter is contributing $25 million of his own money but has a strong relationship with Sherman.\n\nMore: Whatever happened to? Naples finance guru Bruce Sherman\n\nMore: Retiring finance guru Bruce Sherman, in rare interview, talks economy, market, Obama\n\nSherman is the former CEO of Naples-based Private Capital Management, a financial advisory firm he sold to Legg Mason in 2001. His wife Cynthia was a partner in Clifford Chance, a large law firm. They've supported many other charitable organizations, including the Naples Children & Education Foundation, which puts on the annual Naples Winter Wine Festival that has raised millions for children in Collier County.\n\nLast year, the Shermans charitable foundation announced the Sherman Prize, which honors those who make exceptional and pioneering contributions in research on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The Shermans created the prize to recognize and reward exceptional and pioneering achievements in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Sherman's two daughters have Crohn's.\n\nAccording to his bio on the Naples Winter Wine Festival website, Sherman engineered the acquisition of several companies, including Local Financial Corporation, a $3 billion bank in Oklahoma which was acquired in 1989 and sold in 1997. Sherman was an accountant in New York with Arthur Young, and left in 1979 to start his career in venture capital, real estate and media assets.\n\nSherman graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1969 and has a Masters in Business Administration from Bernard Baruch College in 1973.\n\nAs for the Marlins sale, the agreement is expected to be completed on Friday and submitted to Major League Baseball, which likely will not vote on the transaction at next week's owners' meetings in Chicago.\n\nJeter, 43, is expected to run the Marlins' baseball and business side, according to the Herald, with Sherman serving as the club's \"control person\" regarding all matters relating to MLB and the central office.\n\nLoria, 76, bought the Marlins for $158.5 million in 2002 from John Henry. The Marlins won the World Series in 2003 but haven't reached the playoffs since, the longest current drought in the National League.\n\nBefore Friday night's game, Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who also had a storied playing career with the Yankees, told The Associated Press he knew nothing about Jeter becoming a team owner, but predicted he would do well.\n\n\"Derek has been successful at everything he's tried to do,\" Mattingly said. \"What Derek's been able to do with his career, who he is as a person, there's nothing in there that leads you to believe that he's not going to be successful with really whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said it would be good to get Jeter back in the sport.\n\n\"I think Derek Jeter needs to be in the game -- that's the main thing,\" Black said. \"A player like Jeter and what he meant to his generation of players in that era that he played, and now to continue in the game, I think it's wonderful.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:40:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "naplesnews.com", "title": "Naples Daily News", "id": "4337"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:53:00", "url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/08/11/mlb-marlins-reportedly-being-sold-group-including-derek-jeter-naples-bruce-sherman/561452001/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8731508", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/naplesnews.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

(Winslow Townson/AP)\n\nAfter months of speculation about who would emerge as the new owner of the Miami Marlins, the world may have finally gotten its answer on Friday. According to the Miami Herald, which cites \"a New York based MLB source,\" current owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the Marlins to former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter and his business partner Bruce Sherman, a New York businessman. The investment group is said to have around 14 other investors, including Michael Jordan, the Herald reports.\n\nIf the deal for the team, valued at $1.3 billion goes through, Sherman would become the managing general partner, while Jeter, who reportedly put in $25 million of his own money, would be the main point person for both business and baseball operations, according to the Herald's source.\n\nLater on Friday, Fox Sports MLB reporter Ken Rosenthal also received confirmation that the Jeter-Sherman group had won the bid.\n\nThe Derek Jeter-Bruce Sherman group has won the bidding for the #Marlins, sources confirm to me and @CGasparino. First: @clarkspencer.\n\n-- Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) August 11, 2017\n\nThe reports of the winning bid come just days after the Associated Press confirmed a group led by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Quogue Capital investment fund founder Wayne Rothbaum had halted its bid for the team. Besides the Jeter group, the only other bidder who remained after Bush-Routhbaum dropped out was one led by South Florida businessman Jorge Mas, according to the AP. It is not known whether he put in a bid.\n\nNo party connected to the reported deal has commented publicly.\n\nIt will likely be weeks before Jeter's group is confirmed as new ownership. MLB officials need to hold a vote to approve the bid, which the Herald reported may not occur until the first week in October.\n\nOnce approved, add this to Derek Jeter's achievements: First African-American to run business and baseball ops of a major-league club.\n\n-- Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) August 11, 2017\n\nLoria, who purchased the team for just more than $158 million in 2002, put the team on the market earlier this year after a tumultuous tenure.\n\n[Don't be fooled by the positive All-Star Game vibes: The Marlins are in need of rescue]\n\nThe Marlins, who won the World Series in 2003 and got a new $634 million ballpark in 2012 mostly courtesy of the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County, have traditionally lagged behind other teams in attendance. Earlier this year, the Marlins earned the dubious honor of hosting the lowest-attended MLB game (not played behind closed doors) since 1989 when only 1,590 people showed up to watch the team play the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nSince the team's inception in 1993, it has never finished the season ranked higher than 26th out of 30 MLB teams regarding average attendance.

This could signify a potential rebirth for one of baseball's more hapless franchises.\n\nThe ownership group is primarily financed by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, who according to Miami Herald, made his money founding a wealth management firm called Private Capital Management based in Naples, Florida. But the most famous member of this group is not Sherman, but Yankees legend Derek Jeter.\n\nJeter has not been shy about his desire to own a baseball team. He attempted to purchase the Marlins earlier this year as part of a different ownership group led by former Florida governor Jeb Bush. While Jeter will only contribute $25 million for the Marlins purchase, Sherman will allow Jeter to run the Marlins both on the business and baseball side.\n\nTo go from the famous Yankees to the struggling Marlins will be a significant challenge for Jeter. After winning the World Series in 2004, the Marlins have won zero playoff series since then and have been in the cellar of the National League most of the time. If that was not problematic enough, the Marlins have ranked bottom in attendance for 11 of the last 12 seasons despite playing in a major American city.\n\nOthers have pointed out that there is a major difference between being good at playing sports and being good at running a sports team, using the example of Michael Jordan and his ownership of the Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets. Can Jeter really compete with the analysts, businessmen, and technocrats who run most MLB teams today?\n\nBut for most Marlins fans, just punting Loria out the door is a victory in and of itself. The Marlins owner acquired a reputation as a cheapskate who was more obsessed with making a profit than fielding a winning baseball team. There is also how Loria managed to get the city of Miami to essentially give him hundreds of millions, according to Deadspin, to build a new baseball stadium in 2012.\n\nFinishing up Details\n\nHowever, it may be too early for Miami fans to celebrate just yet. The owners of the other MLB franchises will have to meet and approve the agreement, which will not take place for at least a month. Furthermore, other ownership groups attempted to purchase the Marlins earlier, only for the agreement to fall through for various reasons.\n\nBut it does appear that the sale is much more likely to happen than it is not. And while the Marlins have struggled and are losing money, Loria was still able to sell them for the second largest amount ever paid for a MLB franchise. The Marlins have a new stadium, are in a potentially valuable market, and there are far more rich individuals who want to buy a sports team than there are available teams.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:46:00Z", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "title": "The Inquisitr News", "id": "2639"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:46:00", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/4428047/miami-marlins-sold-to-derek-jeter-backed-group/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8842096", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Derek-Jeter-Miami-purchase.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

A person familiar with the agreement said Friday the Jeter-Sherman group includes more than 10 entities.\n\nSherman spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Fla.\n\nSamson said he hasn't discussed his own status with Sherman or Jeter, although there have been reports he'll remain with the organization.\n\n\"I have been here since 2002,\" Samson said. \"I love it here. I would love to stay here. ... If Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter would like me to serve, then it's something I would certainly talk about.\"\n\nLoria's decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest emerged in April. The Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations.\n\n\"It is a process that has had a lot of twists and turns,\" said Samson, speaking in the Marlins' dugout during batting practice before their game against Colorado.\n\n\"We feel really good. It was very important from Jeffrey's standpoint that there was an ownership group that had not just connections to Miami, but an understanding of what it means to be here in Miami and run a team like the Miami Marlins, and all the possibilities that come with being in a great city like ours.\"\n\nMany around baseball predicted success for the new regime.\n\n\"So Jeter's going to run the Marlins, huh? Great choice,\" Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \"Glad they're not in our league.\"\n\nLoria, 76, has long been criticized for his frugal ways and for the public financing that helped build 5-year-old Marlins Park. The Marlins haven't been to the postseason since 2003, and ranked last in the National League in attendance 11 of the past 12 years.\n\nBut Samson defended Loria, who has owned the team -- now in its 25th season -- longer than predecessors Wayne Huizenga or John Henry combined.\n\n\"I think time will show that through thick or thin, his commitment to Miami never wavered,\" Samson said. \"And it was hard to say that about previous owners.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T02:08:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "pjstar.com", "title": "Journal Star", "id": "578"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:08:00", "url": "http://www.pjstar.com/sports/20170812/marlins-confirm-12-billion-deal-to-sell-to-jeter-group?rssfeed=true", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8862780", "image": "http://www.pjstar.com/storyimage/IP/20170812/SPORTS/170819803/AR/0/AR-170819803.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "02:08:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

He anticipates major league owners will approve the deal in September, and closing will take place shortly after the end of the regular season.\n\nJeter plans be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, who will be the controlling owner. Jeter, a 14-time All-Star shortstop, will be in charge of the business and baseball operations, Samson said.\n\n\"I've gotten to know him through this process,\" Samson said. \"He's an incredibly interesting, articulate, smart, contemplative individual. Forget about Hall of Famer, it's not about that, it's about his ability to run a team and his desire to run a team, and it just came through so clearly what he wanted.\"\n\nAt least 75 percent of the major league clubs must approve the sale by Jeffrey Loria, who has owned the team since 2002. A person familiar with the agreement said Friday the Jeter-Sherman group includes more than 10 entities.\n\nSherman spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nSamson said he hasn't discussed his own status with Sherman or Jeter, although there have been reports he'll remain with the organization.\n\n\"I have been here since 2002,\" Samson said. \"I love it here. I would love to stay here. ... If Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter would like me to serve, then it's something I would certainly talk about.\"\n\nLoria's decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest emerged in April. The Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations.\n\n\"It is a process that has had a lot of twists and turns,\" said Samson, speaking in the Marlins' dugout during batting practice before their game against Colorado.\n\n\"We feel really good. It was very important from Jeffrey's standpoint that there was an ownership group that had not just connections to Miami, but an understanding of what it means to be here in Miami and run a team like the Miami Marlins, and all the possibilities that come with being in a great city like ours.\"\n\nMany around baseball predicted success for the new regime.\n\n\"So Jeter's going to run the Marlins, huh? Great choice,\" Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \"Glad they're not in our league.\"\n\nLoria, 76, has long been criticized for his frugal ways and for the public financing that helped build 5-year-old Marlins Park. The Marlins haven't been to the postseason since 2003, and ranked last in the National League in attendance 11 of the past 12 years.\n\nBut Samson defended Loria, who has owned the team -- now in its 25th season -- longer than predecessors Wayne Huizenga or John Henry combined.\n\n\"I think time will show that through thick or thin, his commitment to Miami never wavered,\" Samson said. \"And it was hard to say that about previous owners.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T00:29:00Z", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "source": {"uri": "dentonrc.com", "title": "dentonrc.com", "id": "2278"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:29:00", "url": "http://www.dentonrc.com/sports/sports-ap-headlines/2017/08/12/marlins-confirm-12-billion-deal-sell-jeter-group", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8857977", "image": "https://dentonrc.imgix.net/1502584025-Rockies-Marlins-Baseball.jpg?w=1200&h=630&format=jpg&crop=faces&fit=crop", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "00:29:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

has been submitted to Major League Baseball to sell the franchise to a group that includes former New York Yankees captain Derek Jeter, and the team expects to close on the deal in early October.\n\nThe MLB ownership committee will review the transaction Wednesday at an owners' meeting in Chicago, Samson said Saturday. He anticipates major league owners will approve the deal in September, and closing will take place shortly after the end of the regular season.\n\nJeter plans be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, who will be the controlling owner. Jeter, a 14-time All-Star shortstop, will be in charge of the business and baseball operations, Samson said.\n\n\"I've gotten to know him through this process,\" Samson said. \"He's an incredibly interesting, articulate, smart, contemplative individual. Forget about Hall of Famer, it's not about that, it's about his ability to run a team and his desire to run a team, and it just came through so clearly what he wanted.\"\n\nAt least 75 percent of the major league clubs must approve the sale by Jeffrey Loria, who has owned the team since 2002. A person familiar with the agreement said Friday the Jeter-Sherman group includes more than 10 entities.\n\nSherman spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nSamson said he hasn't discussed his own status with Sherman or Jeter, although there have been reports he'll remain with the organization.\n\n\"I have been here since 2002,\" Samson said. \"I love it here. I would love to stay here. ... If Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter would like me to serve, then it's something I would certainly talk about.\"\n\nLoria's decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest emerged in April. The Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations.\n\n\"It is a process that has had a lot of twists and turns,\" said Samson, speaking in the Marlins' dugout during batting practice before their game against Colorado.\n\n\"We feel really good. It was very important from Jeffrey's standpoint that there was an ownership group that had not just connections to Miami, but an understanding of what it means to be here in Miami and run a team like the Miami Marlins, and all the possibilities that come with being in a great city like ours.\"\n\nMany around baseball predicted success for the new regime.\n\n\"So Jeter's going to run the Marlins, huh? Great choice,\" Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \"Glad they're not in our league.\"\n\nLoria, 76, has long been criticized for his frugal ways and for the public financing that helped build 5-year-old Marlins Park.

I would love to stay here. ... If Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter would like me to serve, then it's something I would certainly talk about.\"\n\nLoria's decision to sell the team became public in February, and Jeter's interest emerged in April. The Jeter-Sherman group beat out two other groups that pursued the team in the final weeks of negotiations.\n\n\"It is a process that has had a lot of twists and turns,\" said Samson, speaking in the Marlins' dugout during batting practice before their game against Colorado.\n\n\"We feel really good.

Jeter, while wealthy by baseball player standards, could not carry the majority of cost (he's reported to be contributing $25 million to the deal). All along it appeared Loria possibly favored Jeter in the process.\n\nThe vote could be weeks away, with closing expected the first week of October.\n\nJeter's team reportedly consists of about 16 investors with varying stakes in the team, with the largest investment coming from NY businessman and venture capitalist Bruce Sherman. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also had been vying to buy the team, at one point partnering Jeter, but he ended his pursuit this week.\n\nLoria chose to sell the team for personal reasons and had been seeking a buyer for months.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment on the status of sale efforts, which became public in February.

The Marlins originally agreed to sell the team this past offseason, and up until now they had really struggled to sell the organization. On Friday, the Derek Jeter and Bruce Sherman group won the bidding for $1.2 billion. Sherman will reportedly be the control person while Jeter will be the CEO.\n\nBack in May, previous owner Jeffrey Loria was in a precarious situation. He either had to cut the price a second time or he had to take his team off the market. Obviously, the former was the result, and Jeter and company look to hopefully turn this franchise around from its money-losing ways.\n\nThe Marlins are expected to lose more than $60 million this season due to one of the lowest revenues in baseball, and their $115 million payroll is the largest in franchise history. Add a low-paying TV contract, and an average attendance that's regularly in the bottom five in baseball and it's a financial black hole.\n\nLoria had owned the team since 2002, winning a World Series in 2003, but they haven't made the playoffs since then. Only the Mariners have a longer playoff drought in baseball.\n\nThe selling of the franchise could start to get the ball rolling on making the organization better on the field. If you recall, during the deadline, the Marlins flirted with trading their core three in Christian Yelich, Marcell Ozuna and Giancarlo Stanton, but couldn't in part because the team hadn't been sold yet.\n\nNow at this point, neither of the three players are going to make it through waivers, but this winter they could be shopped -- especially Stanton.\n\nWith Jeter expected to run the baseball side of things, it'll be interesting to see if under new ownership they can not only turn it around financially, but performance wise as well.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:17:00Z", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "source": {"uri": "fansided.com", "title": "FanSided", "id": "8632"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:53:00", "url": "https://fansided.com/2017/08/11/miami-marlins-sale-derek-jeter-group/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8731505", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/08/683312950-techcrunch-disrupt-ny-2017-day-1.jpg.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Bronx, it appears that Derek Jeter will pursue a sixth World Series ring as the next chief executive officer of the Marlins, now that the team's owner Jeffrey Loria reportedly has accepted the $1.2-billion bid of the group headlined by the former Yankees' captain.\n\nJeter had spent the past few months rounding up investors to meet Loria's asking price, and that finally came together Friday, with New York venture capitalist Bruce Sherman putting up the majority stake, according to multiple reports.\n\nMost popular baseball stories Mets defend not trading Jay Bruce to Yankees Yanks

with the details of the agreement, which will now have to be voted on by the other 29 owners. The deal needs 75 percent approval, but with the commissioner's office seemingly in Jeter's corner all along, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nJeter's pursuit of the Marlins has been going on since this baseball season began, and there were indications that he had the inside track as early as May before former Florida Governor Jeb Bush dropped out of his ownership group and later joined another.\n\nThe Yankees were unavailable to comment before Friday's series opener against the Red Sox, but their reaction isn't likely to be much different than in April, when many were asked about the possibility of Jeter being part owner of the Marlins.\n\nDerek Jeter lines up a putt during the Celebrity Foursome to benefit the American Family Children's Hospital held during the second round of the American Family Insurance Championship at University Ridge Golf Course on June 24, 2017 in Madison, Wisconsin.

The Miami Herald reported that Sherman will have control over the Marlins, and Jeter -- who is investing roughly $25 million himself -- will handle the baseball and business operations. It's a mammoth undertaking for a rookie CEO like Jeter, and history has shown that these transitions don't necessary guarantee success.\n\n\"Great players don't always translate to great executives, as we've seen,\" CC Sabathia said back in April. \"So we'll have to wait and see what happens for him. Like I said, he's wanted to do this, he's very capable of doing this. We'll have to see how it plays out . . . but I think Jete has a lot to offer.

It was very important from Jeffrey's standpoint that there was an ownership group that had not just connections to Miami, but an understanding of what it means to be here in Miami and run a team like the Miami Marlins, and all the possibilities that come with being in a great city like ours.\"\n\nMany around baseball predicted success for the new regime.\n\n\"So Jeter's going to run the Marlins, huh?

owner of the Miami Marlins, has always loved the New York Yankees.\n\nIt's his favorite team.\n\nHe goes to games at Yankee Stadium.\n\nHe lives in New York.\n\nHe collects art there.\n\nHighest bidder: Jeter-led group agrees to buy Marlins for $1.2 billion\n\nAnd ever since he decided to sell the Marlins, he's always wanted the franchise to go to Derek Jeter.\n\nSo he waited.\n\nThe Jed Bush group came and went. The Mitt Romney group disappeared. New York businessman Wayne Rothbaum bowed out. Miami businessman Jorge Mas jumped in late, but didn't come up with the money.\n\nSo Loria waited, and waited, and finally, with New York businessman Bruce Sherman joining Jeter's group, they came up with the minimum price Loria desired at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe deal was finalized Friday, a high-ranking executive with direct knowledge of the sale confirmed to USA TODAY Sports, but spoke only on the condition of anonymity, since the proposed sale has yet to be presented to Major League Baseball.\n\nSherman will be the control person. Jeter will be the baseball and business man, and everyone in the MLB offices on Park Avenue in N.Y. are ecstatic.\n\nJeter, one of the iconic names in all of baseball, with five World Series rings and a 14-time All-Star, is back in the game and immediately becomes the most famous face in baseball's ownership circles, supplanting minority owner Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nSure, Jeter is only putting in about $25 million of his own cash.\n\nYes, Jeter has zero front office experience.\n\nAnd, yes, the team is in financial disarray, with projected losses of at least $60 million this season while the team already is in about $500 million of debt.\n\nYet, there finally is hope that the Marlins will be a valuable franchise again, knowing that whatever Jeter has touched, whether it's his Yankee teams, his brands, or even his website, has turned to gold.\n\nThe news of the sale will surely dominate the MLB owners' meetings next week in Chicago, but no vote will be taken. Sherman and Jeter still have to meet with the ownership committee, there will be a recommendation, and finally a vote.\n\nThe deal should be finalized in October, far too late to save this season, but in plenty of time to save the franchise.\n\nIt's a happy day in Florida, and throughout the game of baseball.\n\nJeter is back.\n\nAnd, just maybe, so are the Marlins.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook\n\nGALLERY: Derek Jeter; Yankees legendDerek Jeter through the years Fullscreen Sept. 25, 2014: Jeter celebrates his walk-off single against the Orioles in his final at-bat at Yankee Stadium.

The other leading prospective buyer, Miami businessman Jorge Mas, has not yet been told of any finalized deal, which is believed to be worth $1.2 billion.\n\nSherman, who is putting in the bulk of the money, and as FanRag reported Thursday, recently upped his bid, would be the official control person if the deal goes through. Jeter would have a major role, but MLB people have said that he can't be the control person since he's putting in only about $25 million. Beyond Sherman, most of the other members of Jeter's group are smaller investments, with $5 million, $10 million and $20 million increments. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan is mostly lending his name, and is believed to be contributing no more than a few million dollars, if that.\n\nSources say Jeter's intention is to keep team president David Samson, the stepson of current Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, in some role, and while Samson has said that wasn't part of the negotiation, others say that differentiated Jeter's group from the others, as it's highly unusual to keep a big person in the outgoing group. Baseball president Michael Hill is expected to stay on in a role as well (other groups intended to keep him as well).\n\nJeter has been the preferred buyer all along, but for a long time he had been well short of the funds. It appears the deal was kept alive long enough for him to garner the funds, asssuming this goes through.\n\nMajor League Baseball owners would still need to approve any potential new owners.\n\nRelated Items:FRS News, Miami Marlins, NL East, Todays MLB News", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:52:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "fanragsports.com", "title": "FanRag Sports", "id": "16930"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:12:00", "url": "https://www.fanragsports.com/news/heyman-jeter-group-closing-marlins-purchase/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8717134", "image": "https://www.fanragsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AP_17135054837555.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Major League Baseball is expected to receive the written agreement on Friday.\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald report, Jeter is believed to be contributing only $25 million of his own money. Sherman, who will reportedly assume a role similar to a managing general partner, and a group of 16 investors were called on to help bolster the group's bid. The investors are reported to include NBA legends Michael Jordan, whose friendship with Jeter has been well documented.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nThe sale would need approval from the league before becoming official. According to the Miami Herald report, a resolution may not come until October. MLB officials are expected to discuss the sale when owners meet in Chicago next week. A vote then is considered unlikely.\n\nThe Jeter/Sherman group edged out Miami businessman Jorge Mas and his contingent. The Mas group was considered a strong favorite as recently as the All-Star game, which took place in Miami and saw Mas sharing the owner's box with Loria throughout the events.\n\nAs MLB Network's Ken Rosenthal notes, once the deal is approved, Jeter will become the first African-American to run the business and baseball operations for a major-league club.\n\nOddly enough, it was Jeter's desire to control both of those elements that ultimately led to his partnership with former Florida governor Jeb Bush falling apart. Some believed Bush's departure would be a crippling blow to Jeter's bid, but once Bush and new partner Wayne Rothbaum dropped out of the running this week Jeter's group was able to rebuild its momentum and now seems poised to run the show on South Beach.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nMark Townsend is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

legend and Kalamazoo native, appears to be set to become a major-league owner.\n\nAccording to a report in the Miami Herald on Friday afternoon, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the franchise to a group led by Jeter and New York businessman Bruce Sherman for $1.2 billion.\n\nMLB was to receive a written agreement later Friday, a source told the Herald.\n\nJeter is expected to contribute $25 million and run the baseball operations, the Herald reported. The Herald reported there are 16 investors.\n\nSeveral big names were involved, at one time, in the bidding, including Tagg Romney, the son of former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nJeter, 43, was the No. 6 overall pick in the 1992 draft, out of Kalamazoo Central High School. He debuted for the Yankees in 1995 and played his entire career in pinstripes, retiring at the end of the 2014 season. He won five World Series championship, was the 1996 rookie of the year and was a 14-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove winner.\n\nHe played 20 years in all, batting .310/.377/.440 with 260 home runs, 1,311 RBIs, 358 stolen bases and 3,465 hits.\n\nSince retiring, he's been involved in a number of business ventures, including with the website The Players' Tribune. He also has attended multiple Michigan football games, and has served as an honorary captain. Jeter was to attend Michigan before signing with the Yankees out of high school.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:47:00Z", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "title": "The Detroit News", "id": "2989"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:47:00", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/08/11/report-derek-jeter-deal-buy-marlins/104506864/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8698740", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f764e2d5157774759d5f42d3975f68a249f1104d/c=0-170-3248-2005&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2017/08/11/DetroitNews/B99564031Z.1_20170811161603_000_GUO1JOE6C.1-0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:47:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

I think the Marlins as a whole organization need a fresh start.\"\n\nJason Reinhard, a native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, was attending Friday's game against the Rockies with his family. Although he said he is not a Marlins fan in particular, Reinhard is a big baseball fan and thinks the sale will bring something positive to the team.\n\n\"[Jeter] has the experience of being with a winning organization and a winning club,\" Reinhard said. \"You would think he recognizes talent. He's been involved with it with the Yankees. They've built up a farm system as well. He's seen all aspects of a team from top to bottom.

I just hope he can drive us the way he did his team as a player and one day take us to a World Series.\"\n\nAlex Cepero, a Cuban resident of Miami that has been a Marlins fan since 2009, said he was glad to see Loria sell the team because \"he is tired of seeing key players come and go on the Marlins roster for years.\"\n\n\"Whenever we finally put together a team with players of high caliber, we give them away,\" Cepero said. \"It's important that we have a new owner, but not just anyone. But with someone like Derek Jeter, I think winning is in his blood. I think he's going to put his heart into this team to make sure it reaches a high level.\"\n\nCepero said he is aware that even with a new owner the Marlins will likely need to make moves to bolster their roster and farm system that will take some time.\n\n\"I'm aware making this team better won't happen overnight,\" Cepero said. \"They have to work on improving this team's pitching staff overall.

To this point, three primary bidding groups were said to be vying to purchase the club from Jeffrey Loria.\n\nWhile there's still no evident movement toward resolution, that same inaction may have contributed to the loss of one possible buyer. It now seems the Fish are down to two prospective new ownership groups. Per Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, the group that had included Wayne Rothbaum, Jeb Bush, and a host of former players is now out of the hunt. (Previously, that group had lost Tagg Romney but picked up Bush in the ever-changing bidding landscape.)\n\nRothbaum was the chief investor of that party, and reportedly was willing to lead the charge at a valuation of $1.17B. With that offer apparently waving in the wind, and with no resolution in sight, Rothbaum evidently determined it was no longer worth pursuing the club.\n\nThat said, it's also possible that the Rothbaum group's bid was never going to be quite to the Marlins' expectations. Jon Heyman of Fan Rag suggests that the aggregation of would-be owners may have been sitting in a lower range -- $1B to $1.1B.\n\nWhatever the case, the chase for the Marlins now seems to be down to two possible bidding groups. One, guided by Miami businessman Jorge Mas, seems to be a fairly straightforward outfit led by one primary investor who'd also be the control person. Per Heyman, Mas remains the \"best-financed\" pursuer. But there's still a possibility that MLB legend Derek Jeter could make a deal happen; while it's somewhat odd that he'd represent the control person, given that he would not be investing a significant portion of any sale price, Jeter (like Mas) is said by Jackson to have \"made progress in assembling the financing needed.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T13:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors", "id": "2047"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:13:00", "url": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2017/08/latest-on-bidding-for-marlins.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8621279", "image": "https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2017/07/Marlins-Park-2-770x1024.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "13:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Where the ticker-tape at? Is it me, or do I already hear the distant, joyous cacophony of pots and pans being banged with wooden spoons? Along with the rising chant of a multitude singing, \"Ding dong, the witch is dead!\"\n\nLet us mark Aug. 11, 2017, as Independence for Marlins baseball fans -- the day despised, longtime franchise owner Jeffrey Loria reached an agreement to sell the club and ballpark, for $1.2 billion, to the consortium led by New York venture capitalist Bruce Sherman and fronted by former Yankees icon Derek Jeter, \"The Captain.\"\n\nThe deal must wend its way through the usual vetting and red tape, and the closing might not come until October. But that's OK. Parades take time to organize, right? The 16 investors in the winning group reportedly includes Michael Jordan, one of Jeter's good superstar buds. So M.J. can bring the victory cigars.\n\nThis is what most every Marlins fan has dreamed of, including the many who pledged to never support the club as long as Loria owned it but flock back into the fold the moment he sold.\n\nThe new owners will sweep in heroically on metaphorical white steeds by virtue of not being Jeffrey Loria. Any buying group would have enjoyed that honeymoon and bounce, but especially this one. Sherman is a philanthropist and Marlins fan. Jeter is Jeter, impeccable of reputation, imprimatur of success, and a magnet, surely, to the mass of transplanted New Yorkers and Yankees fans in South Florida.\n\n\"I can always talk about Derek, a kid I've known since his first step in major-league spring training,\" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said Friday as the news of the sale-agreement broke like party pinatas across South Florida. \"Derek has been successful in everything he's tried to do. There's nothing that leads you to believe he won't be successful [as an owner].\"\n\nSherman will be the money man with ultimate say, akin to what Stephen Ross is with the Dolphins or Micky Arison with the Heat. But Jeter, a relatively minor investor of $25 million of his own money -- and wouldn't we all love to be so rich that $25M was seen as a minor investment! -- supposedly will be the baseball man in charge of the on-field product. He'll be the Pat Riley.\n\nTogether money-man Sherman and baseball-guy Jeter will decide what to spend on who and how to end a 14-season playoff drought, fill Marlins Park and realize South Florida's full and untapped potential as a baseball market.\n\nOnce we're past the giddy euphoria of \"Loria's gone,\" what's next?\n\nWill Sherman spend more than Loria? Will Jeter direct that spending more wisely? Will the new owners pledge to keep cornerstone Giancarlo Stanton? Or will they jettison his escalating contract in a move that might be justified as financially prudent but would feel like a Loria-esque salary dump to fans? Oh, and will those disenfranchised fans who pledged to come back really do so?\n\nOne more: Does Derek Jeter's Hall of Fame career, business acumen and heft of reputation necessarily mean he knows how to run a baseball team?\n\nYes, that overarching question -- Now what? -- will loom ever larger as the sale becomes complete, power changes hands, Loria waves goodbye to the sound of one hand clapping, and Jeter is introduced as the new face of the franchise.\n\nBut that's for later.\n\nFor now, hear the sound of those windows banging open and feel the fresh air gusting in.

afternoon, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the franchise to a group led by Jeter and NY businessman Bruce Sherman for $1.2 billion.\n\nJeter's team reportedly consists of about 16 investors with varying stakes in the team, with the largest investment coming from NY businessman and venture capitalist Bruce Sherman.\n\nA purchase agreement for the team is reportedly expected to be finalized Friday and submitted to Major League Baseball.\n\nJeter would run both the baseball and business sides of the team, despite investing a small amount of his own money.\n\nSherman increased his investment in the Marlins bid after wealthy Chicago businessman Richard Chaifetz backed out of the deal. Jeter will contribute about $25 million to the purchase, but he is close with Sherman, thus granting him vast power once the sale is completed. Sherman, a New York-based businessman, will be the controlling owner. Jordan recently joined Jeter's team last month, although it isn't known how much money the former Bulls star is contributing. Loria bought the Marlins in 2002 for $158.5 million.\n\nMarlins president David Samson declined to comment on the status of sale efforts, which became public in February.\n\nMajor League Baseball officials are expected to discuss the sale in owners meetings in Chicago next week, but voting isn't expected to happen for another month. It is he who will be referred to as the team's owner.\n\nJeter, meanwhile, would give the Marlins cachet and a former player universally respected in baseball.\n\nJeter won five World Series (1996, 1998 through 2000 and 2009) and holds many postseason records.\n\nRelated News: 12 August 2017 Analysts Anticipate Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) to Announce $0.40 EPS Long Term Growth review of Nabors Industries Ltd.

On the other hand, FanRag Sports has already reported that the addition of Jeter's biggest investor, Bruce Sherman, has significantly helped that group's case en route to becoming the current frontrunner in the Marlins sweepstakes.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that Loria is leaning toward the Sherman-Jeter Group, any deal that is eventually agreed upon would still require approval from Major League Baseball's owners.\n\nEven with the Marlins slated to change hands, it would be expected that the club's president of baseball operations, David Samson, would remain in place in Miami for the time being should the sale go through. Should the group be successful in acquiring the Marlins, Sherman would be a control guy with Jeter slated to take a high-level position under the club's umbrella as well.\n\nRelated Items:FRS News, Miami Marlins, NL East, Todays MLB News", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {"gpCnt": 3}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:52:00Z", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "source": {"uri": "fanragsports.com", "title": "FanRag Sports", "id": "16930"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:12:00", "url": "https://www.fanragsports.com/news/heyman-progress-being-made-toward-derek-jeters-acquisition-of-marlins/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8717114", "image": "https://www.fanragsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AP_17135054837555.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Thrones,\" with plenty of perceived villains and heroes. So, until the financing of the proposed sale of the franchise is fully examined and approved by Major League Baseball, Derek Jeter and the money men who aspire to own the Marlins will have to wait.\n\nBut if the deal is completed -- if -- Jeter will assume the role of chief executive officer, in charge of business and baseball operations, despite having had no practical experience or formal training for that position.\n\nHe has been a success at pretty much everything he has done in his life, from playing shortstop to performing in the World Series to hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" to serving as a pitchman for some of the country's largest companies. But trying to pump life into a dormant franchise in Miami might be the greatest challenge he has ever faced -- so great, rival executives say, that there's a real chance that nobody can overcome all of the Marlins' problems.\n\nWith that in mind, some advice for Jeter, based on some input from officials and evaluators involved in baseball.\n\n1. Jeter must rebrand the franchise entirely and work to distinguish it from the Marlins' toxic past. The bottom line is that some fans in Miami have stayed away from the Marlins because of the actions of Jeffrey Loria, who stripped down the team repeatedly to minimum payrolls, even after the team moved into a taxpayer-funded ballpark.\n\nJeter and the owners he will work for need to do everything they can to separate the new Marlins from the old Marlins -- different colors, a different logo, the construction of relationships in the community, even the deconstruction of the home run sculpture in left-center field, which has become a symbol of Loria's ownership.\n\n\"The more that I think about it,\" said one marketing type, \"blowing up that home run display might be a cathartic thing for the fan base. It's got to go, and quickly.\"\n\nHere's the other part of this: Jeter needs to execute this shift quickly, from the first day he takes over. The longer he waits to build a wall between the old Marlins and the new Marlins is lost opportunity, because after Jeter's group takes over, he will gradually lose the attention of fans. He has a finite amount of time to reset the image of the Marlins in Miami.\n\n2. Jeter should keep Giancarlo Stanton. Squeezing Stanton's rising salary will be extremely difficult over the next decade, because he's owed $295 million. There is a reasonable argument to be made that, for the incoming owners, it would be better if the outgoing owners dumped Stanton early in the offseason, to clear the payroll (and debt).\n\nThe problem is that from this day forward, any move will be seen in the public's eye as the responsibility of Jeter and the new owners, and the trade of Stanton, the team's monster slugger and face of the franchise, will be perceived as business as usual for the franchise. As Jeter works to rebrand the team, he can't unload Stanton.\n\n3. Jeter needs to seek out the advice of former star players who have gone on to run teams -- Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, John Elway, etc. Initially, Jordan was very hands-on in basketball decisions, and he demonstrated he wasn't very good at it. Johnson doesn't have a lot of experience yet to draw on, but he has run other businesses. Elway built a Super Bowl winner. If Jeter makes these calls, he'll get a lot of thoughts.\n\n4. Jeter should hire really talented front-office types and then get out of the way. It used to be that a lot of general managers were former players, and some had success. But in this analytics-driven era, almost all of the vice presidents and general managers of baseball operations have years of training in negotiations and assessing players and their value. Jeter will know far more about playing shortstop and getting hits than his front-office peers, but he will be out of his element in building organizational talent, weighing player data and assigning appropriate meaning.\n\nAnd besides, Jeter's greatest potential value to the Marlins isn't about seeing games in Class A and identifying a trade target; he can hire people who are really good at that.\n\nNo, Jeter will be worth most to the Marlins in being Derek Jeter -- welcoming possible advertisers in meetings, wooing potential season-ticket holders, making appearances and leading conversations for the club's broadcasters.\n\nJohn Executive could walk into a room of Miami residents and discuss the turnaround of the franchise, and after three minutes, a lot of eyes will be glazing over. But if Jeter does it -- posing for selfies and signing autographs along the way -- he could be turn out to be as big of a draw as any player.\n\n5. Jeter will need to manage up. Jeter would be the most prominent and recognizable face of the Marlins, but the fact is that the real power belongs to the guys who write the biggest checks. While Jeter will be happily embraced by MLB as its only African-American owner, he will have to answer to others in a way that he hasn't for most of his adult life.\n\nFrom the time Jeter reached the big leagues, his managers -- Joe Torre, Joe Girardi -- catered to him, because of his talent as a player. The Yankees sometimes deferred to him because of his star power. When Jeter started The Players' Tribune, he was held up as The Boss because, well, he is Derek Jeter.\n\nBut now, Jeter will work for owners who might be asking hard questions in a few years if the community doesn't respond and the team continues to hemorrhage millions of dollars. This is not something to which he's necessarily accustomed. It's one thing to go in an 0-for-18 slump and answer reporters' questions about your swing, but it's a whole other dynamic if situations arise in which your bosses are wondering about your strategy.\n\nIf the Marlins' business goes really badly, then being Derek Jeter won't necessarily be regarded as a weapon; rather, it might be viewed as a potential liability, because he hasn't run a franchise before. If the Marlins' business goes badly, he may not get the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWhen reporters circled around Dustin Pedroia on Saturday, he deflected questions about the condition of his knee and his availability for the rest of the season. When he was specifically asked whether he is coping with cartilage damage, Pedroia paused momentarily and responded, \"I've got a lot of things going on.\"\n\nAsked about when he would return, he said -- over and over -- \"I'll be out there as fast as I can.\"\n\nAsked about whether doctors had assured him he could return sometime this season, Pedroia said, \"I don't think they can look into the future, either.\"\n\nWith so much uncertainty about the second baseman, the Red Sox might be wise to look for a second baseman, such as Neil Walker of the Mets.\n\n* There was a lot of ridiculousness in the Mets' officials sniping at the Yankees after the two teams failed to agree to a deal for Jay Bruce. But perhaps the most mind-boggling turn was the published revelation from an anonymous Mets executive that their crosstown rival had discussed a possible deal for Walker, only to back away because of injury concerns about the oft-injured infielder. The collateral damage from this was to diminish Walker as a possible trade asset for the rest of August, and, of course, potentially fuel questions about Walker's health from inquiring teams when the he becomes a free agent this fall. Walker might have grounds for a grievance.\n\n* Justin Verlander cleared waivers and, theoretically, the Tigers could talk to other teams about a deal involving the right-hander, who is owed about $8 million for the rest of this season and $28 million for each of the next two years. Theoretically, Detroit could arrange a swap.\n\nBut what has been overlooked in this situation is that Verlander has a full no-trade clause, and no deal will happen unless he agrees -- and he has extraordinary leverage, should he choose to use it. Verlander could ask for a contract extension in return for his approval of a trade, and in fact, it would make a lot of sense for him to do that. Verlander is 34 years old and has been pitching well: In his last 14 starts, dating back to May 30, he has a 3.32 ERA, while holding opponents to a .676 OPS. Over his last seven starts, he has a 1.91 ERA, with just 32 hits allowed and 50 strikeouts in 47 innings.\n\nIf the Astros or Cubs or some other team arranged a deal for Verlander, he has the option of rubber-stamping the trade and moving on without asking for anything. But he won't be a free agent until after the 2019 season, when he'll be closing in on his 37th birthday. He stands to make more money if he exerts his leverage when the Tigers work to trade him, whether that happens this month or in the offseason.\n\n* The other day in St. Petersburg, Boston right-hander Rick Porcello threw the eighth immaculate inning of the 2017 season -- nine pitches, nine strikes, three strikeouts. At the end of the half-inning, Red Sox catcher Sandy Leon walked off the field and, not realizing the significance of what Porcello had just done, flipped the ball into the stands.\n\nPorcello didn't recognize the unusual nature of his feat until he retreated into the clubhouse after the half-inning and saw a text from his brother. A minute or so later, Leon poked his head out of the visitors' dugout and looked into the stands, trying to identify who had gotten the baseball -- a boy wearing a Rays cap, of about 10 or 11 years old.\n\nLeon dispatched a liaison, armed with another baseball, in an effort to get the immaculate-inning ball, but the boy declined the simple swap of ball for ball. Leon and Blaine Boyer than spoke with a security guard, who went to the boy to explain the situation, and with some of the adults around him encouraging him to ask for cash, the youngster named his terms: He asked for an autographed ball from Dustin Pedroia. The security guard agreed, and with the talks concluded, he got congratulatory handshakes from the grown-ups around him. Boyer, who monitored the negotiations from the edge of the dugout, went off in search of Pedroia.\n\nWhen the security guard approached the boy with the newly signed Pedroia ball, the young man carefully examined it, and once satisfied, he reached into the right pocket of his shorts -- in which he had stuffed the immaculate-inning ball -- and made the trade. Once Boyer had the desired ball in hand, he looked into the stands and gave a hearty thumbs up at the kid. Mission accomplished.\n\n* A special \"Call To the Legends\" podcast: Hall of Famer Ivan Rodriguez tells stories from his career, from catching Nolan Ryan when Pudge was 19 years old, to the Robin Ventura fight, to what Johnny Bench told him on the porch at the Otesaga Hotel after Rodriguez was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n* Friday: Diamondbacks GM Mike Hazen on his unusual path from intern to vice president; Indians play-by-play man Tom Hamilton on the Jay Bruce trade, the condition of Andrew Miller and the curveball of Corey Kluber; and the Fireball Express of Karl Ravech and Paul Hembekides on the Mets' sniping at the Yankees, the AL wild-card race and the early excellence of Yu Darvish with the Dodgers.\n\n* Thursday: A conversation with Rays All-Star Corey Dickerson; Jerry Crasnick on the Jay Bruce trade to the Indians; Jessica Mendoza on the challenge that players from Venezuela face with their homeland in disarray.\n\n* Wednesday: Bob Nightengale of USA Today on the suspension of umpire Joe West, and the potential weaknesses for the Dodgers and Astros; Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the midseason makeover of the surging Cardinals; and John Fisher digs into the struggles of Aaron Judge and assesses the impact on the AL MVP race.\n\n* Tuesday: Rays VP Chaim Bloom on the additions Tampa Bay made before the deadline; The Legend Boog Sciambi on Mike Trout and Bryce Harper, the Orioles' playoff chances; Sarah Langs plays The Numbers Game; a conversation with Dodgers phenom Cody Bellinger.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-30", "textEnd": 8244, "textStart": 8238}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:44:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:44:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/buster-olney/post/_/id/17232", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8915866", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0812%2Fr243314_936x526_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

I don't care just yet what kind of an owner Jeter will be.\n\nI'm just happy Jeffrey Loria is leaving.\n\nLet me rephrase that.\n\nI'M HAPPY LORIA IS LEAVING!\n\nLet's revel in that for a moment. In fact, here's a roll of quarters, just in case Jeter and his bidding group's leader Bruce Sherman come up a few bucks short of the reported $1.2 billion sales price. Let's make sure Loria gets on the bus. Get him out of town. Send him to France to take the ambassadorship if that's what it takes, merci beaucoup.\n\nHe's toxic. He's embarrassing. He turned off a generation of baseball fans. He didn't assemble a winner since 2003. He pillaged the local coffers (thanks to Miami-Dade politicians) for a new stadium. He then squandered that public inheritance with a bad product.\n\nIt's not like we're plowing any new ground with any of those statements. But here's something new and invigorating:\n\nHe's moving off the stage.\n\nCan they just yank him off the final few feet?\n\nFor the last decade, it has proved impossible to talk about what the Marlins were doing on the field, because you never got beyond discussing what they were doing off the field. Hirings. Firings. Meddlings. Bumblings.\n\nTheir off-field antics blotted out whatever they were doing on the field to the point that manager Don Mattingly has a functioning professional operation and Giancarlo Stanton leads the league in home runs and no one is paying much attention.\n\nWe'll even accept the idea of Loria's business genius to see him leave. He parlayed an initial $18 million investment in the Montreal Expos into this unbelievably large $1.2 billion payday. Is this a great country or what? Give rich people a publicly funded stadium and watch them grow richer?\n\nMiami businessman Jorge Mas was the people's candidate as next owner. But Jeter and Sherman evidently put up the big money -- and, yes, you have to say evidently because this story has been written with headlines that change for the past five months.\n\nLet's just hope that if Jeter and Sherman complete this sale, and get the requisite vote of baseball's owners, that they understand what they're buying.\n\nThis team, as presently built, isn't going anywhere. The payroll is inflated -- $95 million is contracted to eight players for next season as things stand. The minor league system is ranked the worst in baseball.\n\nThe business model means the Marlins are losing tens of millions this season, according to a source outside the organization who has seen the books. Yes, I know, stop me if you've heard that one before.\n\nThat leads us to the final point of what Loria leaves behind: A fan base that you can't find with a microscope. It challenges annually for the worst attendance in baseball.\n\nYes, fans say they'll return when Loria sells. They probably mean that, too. But Jeter and Sherman need to understand as they buy the team that only winning will bring fans back to baseball here.\n\nThat's Loria's true crime as Marlins owner. He never changed the narrative on him. He won in 2003. But only Seattle has been out of the playoffs for a longer time. Loria never redeemed his sins at the altar of victory.\n\nNew England Patriots owner Bob Kraft once threatened to move the team if public money didn't come jingling for a new stadium. But everyone is too blinded by his five Super Bowl rings to care about that.\n\nLoria hasn't just lost for years. He's lost in a bumbling way. He's lost in a way that his cheapness, traded players and empty stadium were the story. He's lost in a way that makes this sale news worth celebrating.\n\nNo one knows what kind of owners Jeter and Sherman will be. That is tomorrow's story. For now, let's take a deep breath and appreciate the moment sports fans have been dreaming about for years in South Florida.\n\nLoria is leaving the stage.\n\nWait, let's try that again to reflect how everyone feels.\n\nLORIA IS LEAVING THE STAGE!!\n\ndhyde@sun-sentinel.com; On Twitter @davehydesports;\n\nTo read Dave Hyde's blog click here.

In doing so he will slow down the rush to analytics that is now being portrayed the answer to all of baseball's questions.\n\nConsider this comment Jeter made to me at his locker several years before he retired.\n\n\"Everything is about numbers today, this game is more than numbers, buddy,'' Jeter said. He went on to point out the value of scouting, the value of allowing a player to think for himself and not becoming a numbers robot.\n\nPlay the game, not the numbers.\n\nJeter will use analytics to some degree, but he is not going to be ruled by analytics.\n\nRemember this, too: Jeter always played with chip on his shoulder, and he will bring that chip, that desire to prove people wrong and his incredible work ethic to the Marlins as head of baseball operations and part-owner after Jeter's group agreed to purchase the franchise for $1.2 billion Friday.\n\nThe Captain will want to do it his way and prove people wrong. He started The Players' Tribune because he wanted players to have a voice in the media, a new platform without having to rely on traditional media.\n\nIn his heart, Jeter wants to run a baseball team that crushes what he views to be over-the-top analytic-based teams.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, he wants to bring the game back to the players.\n\n\"I think if there is anybody that is equipped to run a team, I think it's him,'' CC Sabathia told The Post on Saturday of the future Hall of Famer. \"Derek or Alex [Rodriguez]. Jetes is really good at reading through bulls-t in life. Getting the best out of people, getting the best out of players. I don't know how all that will translate as an owner, but he is really good at that.\n\n\"It will interesting to see how he runs it with the sabermetrics,'' Sabathia said.\n\nPerhaps it will translate this way: Perhaps pitch counts will grow. Perhaps, if a pitcher is throwing a shutout after six innings, maybe the pitcher will go an extra inning. Perhaps it just won't be a bullpen-by-numbers situation. If a reliever is doing well, maybe he will get an extra out, an extra inning.\n\nPerhaps his team will not shift as much. The 14-time All-Star shortstop was never a big fan of the shift on his way to five World Series rings.\n\nPerhaps everything will not be geared to hitting the home run. There will be room for a batter who inside-outs a pitch the way Jeter was known for as a hitter and his 3,465 hits.\n\nFundamentals will become vital again, cutoffs, too, and making sure to follow the ball like his famous flip play.\n\nIf Jeter is able to do this, the pendulum that has swung in the direction of analytics over this generation will swing a bit back toward scouting, teamwork and finding players who find a way to get the job done.\n\nYankees third baseman Todd Frazier stood alongside Jeter as a 12-year-old Little League star. As a major leaguer he has watched Jeter grow from star to owner. He knows how Jeter battled on the field and that will be key to his running the Marlins.\n\n\"Competition-wise, he played the game,'' Frazier told The Post. \"He understands players. He understands the grind. He might give guys a little more leeway just because he understands what people are going through. At the end of the day I am so happy for him. Just another accolade for him. It's crazy, he goes from baseball player to owner.\n\n\"What's next for him? Maybe being the President of the United States, we'll see what happens.\"\n\nDerek Jeter is going to do baseball his way, and it is going to be fascinating to watch.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:55:00Z", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "title": "New York Post", "id": "13"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:55:00", "url": "http://nypost.com/2017/08/12/derek-jeter-will-bring-old-school-baseball-style-to-the-owners-box/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8855983", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/derek_jeter.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:55:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Yankee Stadium. The captain of the most famous team in American professional sports now gets his chance to run a team of his own in South Florida. Once he worked for Boss Steinbrenner, the most famous boss in the history of baseball. Now, pending approval from Major League Baseball, he becomes one himself.\n\nAll Steinbrenner did back in the '70s was put some of his shipbuilding money on the line when he got the Yankees from CBS, before he set up about getting the Yankees back on top in baseball, and redefining an owner's role in the modern world of sports. Jerry Jones came later. Mark Cuban came later. Steinbrenner did it all first.\n\nNow Jeter, if this deal goes through, will be the baseball boss in Miami, and put more than some of his money on the line. He will lay down his brand as one of the great winners of his time, the player who became even more the face of the Yankees than Steinbrenner was. The Captain moves upstairs now. And now we will see if he can make the transition from great player to great executive that only a handful of sports legends have ever successfully made.\n\n\"Some can do it,\" one sports executive said to me recently, when it was first reported that the group for which Jeter has fronted was a frontrunner to get the Marlins. \"And some turn out to be Isiah Thomas.\"\n\nMichael Jordan, whose Air Jordan shoes Jeter wore as a player, was better at basketball than Jeter was at baseball, and won more titles with the Bulls (six) than Jeter won with the Yankees (five). Now Michael is the owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, a team that is lucky to make the playoffs once in a while, stuck in the worst place of all in the modern NBA, which means the middle. He hasn't moved all that far from the court. You see him sitting right there. He just isn't the one shooting the ball anymore. Or winning the game.\n\nJerry West, who played in 10 NBA finals, is the best example of a Hall of Fame player who became a Hall of Fame executive, most notably with the Lakers. He is the one who got a teenager named Kobe Bryant to Los Angeles. He made the trade for Shaq. If Jeter wants to emulate a basketball immortal, it isn't Michael. It's West.\n\nJohn Elway, who won two Super Bowls as the Broncos' quarterback, now runs the football operation in Denver the way Jeter reportedly will be in charge of the business of baseball in Miami. On Elway's watch, the Broncos have now played in two Super Bowls, and won one. He isn't Jerry West yet, but he is on his way.\n\nBut for every example like that, there is an Isiah Thomas, who turned the Knicks into a Dumpster fire. Later at Madison Square Garden it was Phil Jackson running the basketball operation into the ground. Jackson was much more of a legendary figure as a coach, first with Michael in Chicago, then with Kobe and Shaq in LA, then Jeter was as the star shortstop of the Yankees. And turned out to be completely out of his depth as an executive. In the end, his three lousy years in charge of the Knicks felt like 30.\n\nJeter was one of the smartest, toughest star athletes of his generation. He will certainly be a first ballot Hall of Famer when he becomes eligible in a few years. He ran out to shortstop for the Yankees in April of 1996, stayed there for nearly 20 years and retired with a .310 batting average and 3,465 hits, and a legacy as one of the great October players in the history of the Yankees. He was made for the team, the history, the place, for big moments.\n\nThe Yankees won in '96 and won three more championships in the four years after that. There were times in those years when it seemed as if the winning would go on indefinitely, until the Yankees lost Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, in the bottom of the 9th, to the Diamondbacks. They wouldn't win again until 2009, the last World Series of Jeter's career.\n\nBut there was a day, when the Yankees were still in the middle of all the winning, when I said this to him at his locker at the old Stadium:\n\n\"This can't go on forever, you know.\"\n\nJeter looked up, his face serious and curious at the same time, and said, \"Why not?\"\n\nNow his group gets the Marlins, managed by Don Mattingly, whose career just barely intersected with Jeter's at the end. Jeter gets the Marlins, who took a World Series from him and the Yankees in 2003 that the Yankees were sure they would win. Not much good has happened in baseball in South Florida since. Now Jeter and his money guys are poised to come riding into town to save baseball down there.\n\nIt has been reported that Steinbrenner put up as little as $2 million of his own money when he got the Yankees. He was a shipbuilder from Cleveland and nobody knew much about him, until the whole world knew everything about him. Everybody knows about Jeter. He was the Yankee all the kids wanted to be, for a long time. Now he is set to become a different kind of player. No. 2 becomes the No. 1 guy in the front office in Miami. He is about to become Boss Jeter. Long way from shortstop at the Stadium. Lot more than money on the line.\n\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:14:00Z", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "title": "Daily News", "id": "422"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:14:00", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/lupica-jeter-puts-rep-line-marlins-boss-article-1.3404600", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8732790", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3404286.1502502810!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/marlins-sale-baseball.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

It there a double rainbow arching above its futuristic dome?\n\nYep. It's a new day for the Miami Marlins. The team and stadium are getting new owners, pending approval of Major League Baseball. This shouldn't be anything but a slam dunk when the team owners meet in October to consider the sale, the mixed sports metaphor aside.\n\nThis is an opportunity for South Florida fans to forgive and embrace -- and fill that beautiful stadium.\n\nWelcome Derek Jeter and New York/Naples businessman Bruce Sherman, who a decade ago played a pivotal role in the sale of the Miami Herald, then owned by Knight-Ridder, to McClatchy.\n\nJeter and Sherman have tentatively purchased the Marlins and its stadium for $1.2 billion.\n\nWe have a wish list for the new owners:\n\n\u25aa We need to you to help us fall in love with the Marlins again -- as we did during their World Series days.\n\n\u25aa We need you to make the team feel like its part of the community.\n\n\u25aa And we need you to help heal the wounds between fans and the team.\n\nThere are those who have never forgiven Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, the most reviled local team owner, from finagling a stadium out of Miami and Miami-Dade so that his privately owned, money-making team got a shiny new place to play largely financed with taxpayers money. Well, they can put the hatchet away.\n\nFor those who never forgave Loria for the fire sale of talent following the 2003 World Series win? It's time for them, too, to chill. Ditto for those who disliked the ownership's dismissive attitude toward fans.\n\nJeter now stands to become the face of the Marlins. He had the staying power to best former Gov. Jeb Bush, businessman Jorge Mas and other boldface names. It'll be a boost to have an owner who is baseball royalty. Throw NBA crown prince Michael Jordan into the mix as a minority owner and the star power is undeniable.\n\nThe betrayal taxpayers felt from the Marlins ownership rattled the community when they learned that the bulk of the stadium debt fell on them, thanks to the sweetheart deal approved by both Miami and Miami-Dade politicians who feared Loria would take his team and leave.\n\nThe 2009 deal said the Marlins would contribute only a fraction of the cost. But the team's financials were leaked, revealing that they were in fact making money on taxpayers' backs.\n\nThere's still fallout: David Beckham is still trying to get a stadium built for a Major League Soccer team, but repeatedly hit a wall over the cost -- even though he says it would be privately financed. Ironically, the Beckham group didn't want to build next to Marlins Park, calling the venue \"spiritually tainted.\"\n\nThe same happened to Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross in his efforts to get state money to overhaul Hard Rock Stadium. Ross found closed doors in Tallahassee, and the billionaire had to personally pay for the stadium's renovation.\n\nBut now the community should start with a clean slate for Jeter and Sherman, even though the horrible death of ace pitcher Jose Fernandez will be one bit of sadness that will be near impossible to wipe away.\n\nThe Miami Marlins just need to start winning. There's great karma sweeping out the bad. Let's rally 'round under that rainbow.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:13:00Z", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "title": "Miami Herald", "id": "283"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:13:00", "url": "http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article166851187.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8732746", "image": "http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/ht7kbf/picture166851182/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/Jeterpic", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

every year pledging to adhere to acceptable forms of personal behavior, or else he wouldn't be allowed to play the sport that he loved most: baseball.\n\nDerek Jeter was the obedient son.\n\nAnd now, one of the sport's most respected figures is on the verge of bringing that discipline and positive work ethic to the Miami Marlins as part of an ownership group that has agreed to buy the team from Jeffrey Loria.\n\n\"Derek's easy to talk about because he's a kid I've known since he first stepped into major league spring training,\" said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, whose final year with the New York Yankees in 1995 coincided with Jeter's first in the Bronx. \"There's nothing to lead you to believe that he's not going to be successful at whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nJeter starred as a shortstop for 20 years in the majors, all with the Yankees.\n\nHe won five World Series rings. He won Gold Gloves and was named to All-Star teams. He totaled more than 3,400 hits, stole more than 300 bases and ended his playing career in 2014 with a .310 average.\n\nThe Yankees retired his No. 2 in May, gave him a monument with all the other Yankees greats, from Babe Ruth to Yogi Berra, from Joe DiMaggio to Mickey Mantle, and from Whitey Ford to Lou Gehrig.\n\nHe was their \"Captain,\" their leader.\n\nBut the numbers only begin to tell the story of Jeter, who commanded the respect of teammates and opponents like few others.\n\nMarlins outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, one of the all-time greats, said few players commanded as much respect as Jeter did when he played with and against him.\n\nSuzuki, who was Jeter's teammate on the Yankees from 2012-2014, said no player ever struck him as anyone who would go on to become an owner or head of a team's baseball operations department, a role Jeter is expected to assume with the Marlins if the sale is ultimately approved.\n\n\"If you had asked me that,\" Suzuki said, \"there's probably nobody I would have thought of that would fill that role. But, actually, [Jeter] is the one player you could actually see doing that, not just because he's a smart baseball man. He has a passion for baseball, and deep feelings for baseball.\"\n\nSuzuki said Jeter was so even-keeled that it was impossible to tell whether he was having a good or bad day.\n\n\"You wouldn't know if he was on a good streak or a bad streak,\" Suzuki said. \"There are very few people I have seen that have been able to do that, day after day -- come in and work without knowing whether they're up or down. He was able to control his emotions, and that left an impression on me.\"\n\nIt was grounded in him from an early age by his parents. His mother was an accountant, his father a substance-abuse counselor. Born in Pequannock, N.J., the family moved to Kalamazoo, Mich., when he was 4.\n\n\"I was always afraid of disappointing my parents,\" Jeter once said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview.\n\nHe was a high school standout, prompting the Yankees -- his favorite boyhood team -- to take him with the sixth overall pick in the 1992 amateur draft. But success on the field didn't come immediately. In 1993, his first full season in the minors, he made 56 fielding errors.\n\nIn time, though, Jeter became a star. He was named American League Rookie of the Year in 1996 and remained a mainstay in the Yankees' lineup until his final game in 2014.\n\n\"You never saw Derek in any type of controversy, or anything that would be away from his character,\" Mattingly said.\n\nUnlike so many other stars of the so-called \"Steroids Era,\" Jeter's name was never linked to performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nHe never ran afoul of the law. Aside from relationships with entertainers (Mariah Carey) and models (Vida Guerra), he managed to stay out of the tabloids.

Back in April, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria agreed in theory to sell the team to a group led by Jeter and Jeb Bush; then came reports that they didn't have the full financing secured yet; then they failed to get it. Bush dropped out.\n\nNow the Marlins will sell to a group led by Bruce Sherman, a Manhattan venture capitalist and cofounder of the Naples-based Private Capital Management. The group includes 16 different investors, and among them is Michael Jordan.\n\nBut it's Jeter who will be the clear face of the ownership group, much like NBA legend Magic Johnson when he bought the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Guggenheim Partners in 2012.\n\nJeter, according to reports, is contributing $25 million of his own money -- just 2.08% of the price tag. But he will run baseball operations.\n\nHe has the star power, the connections, and the baseball cred; he just needed the money. And becoming an MLB part owner is just the latest step in a post-baseball career that has become the model for retired pro athletes.\n\nIs $1.2 billion for the Marlins crazy?\n\nNow, how about that price tag?\n\n$1.2 billion for a franchise that lost money last year, has not made the playoffs in 14 years, and does not play in a top-10 sports media market?\n\nSure. The price should come as no surprise, since American pro sports teams have been one of the few investments almost guaranteed to grow in value -- and grow in value quickly.\n\nThe most recent 15 American pro sports teams to sell (in the 'big three' leagues: NFL, NBA, MLB) have all sold for prices that shattered their most recent Forbes valuation (widely cited as the de facto best estimate of sports franchise values) at the time of sale. That's a sign that the market has deemed almost any pro franchise extremely valuable, regardless of the geographic location and the team's recent win record.\n\nHere are the five most recent pro sports teams (NFL, NBA, or MLB) to change hands, with the valuation and the sale price bolded for emphasis. You'll notice that every one of them sold for a premium over their Forbes valuation: Seattle Mariners, Aug. 2016, valued at $1.2 billion, sold 90% for $1.26 billion, valuing the team at $1.4 billion; Brooklyn Nets, Dec. 2015, valued at $1.6 billion, sold for $1.7 billion; Atlanta Hawks, June 2015, valued at $825 million, sold for $850 million; Buffalo Bills, Sept. 2014, valued at $935 million, sold for $1.1 billion; LA Clippers, June 2014, valued at $575 million, sold for $2 billion.\n\nIn its MLB valuations in April, Forbes pegged the Marlins at $940 million, ranking them 25th out of MLB's 30 teams. And yet, Loria -- an owner who drove the team into the ground -- managed to fetch over $1 billion, valuation be damned.\n\nMajor League Baseball officials will get the sale contract papers on Friday night, the Herald reports, and the sale is expected to close in October.\n\n--\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.

"Jeffrey Loria bought the Florida Marlins in 2002 and the next season the club won a wild card and would rally to beat the Cubs in a memorable NLCS and upset the Yankees to win the second World Series in franchise history.\n\nSince winning that World Series, the Marlins haven't made the playoffs. Key pieces like Derrek Lee, Josh Beckett and Brad Penny were traded away and Miguel Cabrera was eventually traded after the 2007 season. They've finished as high as second place just once since 2003 and are headed for their eighth consecutive losing season. It's safe to say that nobody is really going to miss Jeffrey Loria as owner of the Marlins.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported that Loria has agreed to sell the team to a group led by billionaire money manager Bruce Sherman and former Yankees great Derek Jeter for $1.2 billion. Sherman, a venture capitalist with ties to Florida, would be the managing general partner of the group of investors (which includes Michael Jordan), while Jeter, who is reportedly investing $25 million of his own money, would run the franchise on both the business and baseball operations ends.\n\nLoria's ultimate legacy will be that of a lousy and disliked owner, but, in one sense, he outfoxed everyone all along. His original investment was $30 million in the Montreal Expos. Some of his former partners there accused him of deliberately destroying baseball in Montreal. He became part of a controversial swap that allowed him to buy the Marlins and then-Marlins owner John Henry to purchase the Red Sox while the league-owned Expos were eventually relocated to Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter crying poor for years, Miami-Dade County finally caved and helped build Loria a stadium in what will be an economically disastrous deal for the county: a $91 million loan will eventually cost the county more than $1 billion to pay off. That's not Loria's fault, but the new stadium has done little to improve the Marlins' fortunes.\n\nFor years, Loria's game plan seemed simple: Keep the payroll as low as possible while cashing a big revenue-sharing check. The Marlins ran the majors' lowest payroll in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2014 and 2015 while ranking second-lowest in two other seasons. The Marlins undoubtedly were profitable many of those years despite poor attendance and poor TV revenue. In fact, in 2010 the club was forced to raise its payroll after reaching an agreement with the union. Ultimately, this was a skinflint owner who may have liked baseball, but had no idea how to build a successful franchise. The team has rarely invested in Latin America and the farm system has turned into one of the weakest in the game in recent years.\n\nThe past two seasons, the Marlins did raise their payroll, essentially doubling the total from 2015, and the club had the 20th-highest Opening Day payroll. Unfortunately, the product on the field remained mediocre and the Herald reported that \"The Marlins are expected to lose more than $60 million this season, according to a source who has seen their books.\" The team reportedly carried a debt of $500 million.\n\nIf that's the case, I guess the billion-dollar question is what Sherman, Jeter and Co. can hope for with this purchase. Loria's ultimate failure wasn't just on the field, but in building a fan base. The team ranks last in attendance in the National League -- just as it has each season since 2006, except for the first year in the new ballpark. Maybe that's not Loria's fault. It could be that Miami just isn't a good baseball city (or sports city, for that matter). But it's also true that the fans were treated to the sell-off after 1997 and then Loria's slow sell-off of the 2003 team. It also takes a generation or two to form a history and loyalty needed for consistent support. Still, who wants to support a team that is suing one of its own fans?\n\nWinning over the fans may be tougher than building a winning team, and who knows how much the team's finances will affect the new owners and the ability to spend on payroll (it doesn't help that Giancarlo Stanton's salary increases from $14.5 million to $25 million next season and escalates from there if he doesn't opt out).\n\nThe other unknown is Jeter. He was obviously a great player, but that doesn't mean he'll be great at running a baseball team. It also doesn't mean he won't be great. It's impossible to know. As good a player as he was, it's difficult to get a read on Jeter's potential acumen in running a team. He was always the master of being accessible without ever saying anything that was interesting.\n\nStill, this can only be viewed as positive news in South Florida. The franchise needs new blood and new ideas. Good riddance to a bad owner. For the first time in a long time, there's hope in Miami.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:34:00Z", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:34:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/81874", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8730013", "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0811%2Fr242968_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:34:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

as a man who wore a pinstriped suit to work for 20 years but now, we cannot even be certain Derek Jeter will continue to wear that attire once he is in place as part of the Bruce Sherman-led ownership group that has reached an agreement in principle to purchase the Marlins for $1.2 billion.\n\nIndeed, conjuring visions of Jeter running the baseball and business operations from behind a desk in South Florida leaves us with essentially a blank slate in the aftermath of two decades in the land of Page Six and the epicenter of baseball, through which No. 2 revealed little of himself beyond name, rank and serial number.\n\nWe can, however, surmise Jeter will be as prepared, disciplined and competitive in this endeavor as he was in producing near-metronomic excellence on the field for the Yankees. This is not an individual who can be expected to punch in at 9 a.m., punch out at 5 p.m. and let the chips fall where they may, banking on his magic name to be a substitute for all of the grunt work necessary to build and maintain a successful franchise.\n\nThere aren't many to have crossed the divide from the field to the owners' suite, and there are even fewer to have made the jump with notable success. Indeed, it could be that only Mario Lemieux, who has won two Stanley Cups as Penguins owner after having won two on the ice, qualifies in that regard.\n\nThough Jeter lends marquee power and credibility to the ownership group that includes Michael Jordan -- who coincidentally serves as a cautionary tale to those who presume greatness on the field equates to success in the front office -- it is not as if the pending Hall of Fame shortstop is regarded in Miami as one of them, the way Lemieux was in Pittsburgh.\n\nYou know who would be? Alex Rodriguez, that's who, but that is a whole different tale.\n\nJeter spent his entire career working for an organization that annually had one of the league's top two or three payrolls and flexed its financial muscle to camouflage roster blemishes like an adolescent addicted to Clearasil. He won't be living large like that while straddling his roles on the player and business side for one of the sport's traditional sisters of the poor.\n\nBut Jeter lived through the downside of playing for a club whose feeder system had atrophied and had run dry. Surely he recognizes baseball is a ground-up business, more now than ever since the collapse four decades ago of the reserve system.\n\nWhat does that mean for the future of the larger-than-life Giancarlo Stanton, who has three years at $77 million on his contract prior to an opt-out after 2020 and whose trade simultaneously would strike at the team's immediate credibility while bringing back a mother lode of prospects?\n\nWe can be confident in suggesting Jeter's circle of influence is wider than his circle of influencers. We don't know to whom he will turn for advice or whom he will enlist to join him, though it might not be a stretch to suggest Jorge Posada and Gerald Williams could wind up in South Florida. We also can be confident in suggesting there will be no shortage of capable and successful people yearning to join Jeter in this endeavor.\n\nThere is no reason Jeter's relationship with the Yankees and New York -- arm's length since his retirement following the 2014 season -- should change. But what if Jeter, for instance, wants to hire and give a job of front office prominence to Gary Denbo, the current Yankees vice president of player development, with whom the shortstop was close throughout his pro career?\n\nQuestion: Will this Yankees icon fire another one, manager Don Mattingly, as one of his first acts in office? Better question: Will he forbid facial hair and mandate short hair for Marlins players? The world wants to know.\n\nWhen the sale is approved, Jeter will become the first African-American to run baseball and business operations for a major league team. This is a man of detail and of success who represents the embodiment of the American dream and who, so far as the public is aware, never has failed. The pinstriped clothes never made the man as much as the man made the pinstriped clothes.\n\nJeter has lived the dream and now he accomplishes what has long been a dream of his own -- to become part of a major league baseball ownership group. But does that mean he will succeed?\n\nNot necessarily, but we know that he will be prepared and pay attention to detail. He always has.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:05:00Z", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "title": "New York Post", "id": "13"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:05:00", "url": "http://nypost.com/2017/08/11/derek-jeter-will-be-prepared-but-will-he-succeed-as-an-owner/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8732275", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/jeter.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:05:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Miami Dolphins quarterback will undergo an operation to repair the torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the entire season, a person familiar with the decision said Friday. The person confirmed the decision to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Dolphins hadn't disclosed it publicly. Tannehill will be placed on injured reserve, the person said. Tannehill, who missed the final four games of last season with two sprained ligaments in his knee, reinjured it a week into training camp on Aug. 3. The Dolphins consulted with specialists before the team and Tannehill decided surgery was the best option. Tannehill opted not to have surgery after last season's injury, and instead rehabilitated the partially torn ligaments and underwent stem cell treatments. Jay Cutler, who parted with the Chicago Bears after eight seasons, agreed to delay his fledgling network TV career and signed a $10 million, one-year contract Monday to replace Tannehill. Cutler, 34, might make his Dolphins debut in their second exhibition game next Thursday. Tannehill won the No. 1 job for Miami's opener in his rookie season of 2012 and made 77 consecutive starts before his injury last season. He's expected to be ready for the start of training camp next season.\n\nFlacco back soon\n\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco will soon return to practice, but he won't play in a game before the team opens the regular season on Sept. 10 at Cincinnati. The Ravens announced Friday that Flacco's progress from a back injury is \"good,\" and that he will begin practicing in the preseason. The 10-year pro has not taken a snap at training camp. Meanwhile, the Ravens say offensive lineman Alex Lewis will miss the 2017 season with a shoulder injury. He will undergo surgery next week. Lewis played in 10 games last season. He missed one week with a concussion and was sidelined for five weeks with an ankle injury. Also on Friday, the Ravens revealed that rookie Tim White will have season-ending surgery on his thumb. White, a rookie free agent out of Arizona State, scored a touchdown in Thursday's victory over the Redskins.\n\nNewton on mend\n\nCarolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is on the mend. Newton threw passes to receivers during an individual period early in practice on Friday, according to the Charlotte Observer. However, Newton continued to be held out of team drills. Newton had shoulder surgery in March to repair a partially torn rotator cuff and had not thrown in practice other than light warmup tosses since July 30. He did not play in the team's preseason opener Wednesday night against the Houston Texans. It's unclear if Newton will play in the Aug. 19 preseason game against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nBaylor gets order\n\nA judge has ordered Baylor University to turn over documents from the investigation that found widespread mishandling of sexual assault cases, some involving football players. The materials have to be provided to attorney Jim Dunnam, a former state representative who's representing several women who say they were raped while at the college, according to court documents. Baylor argued that the documents were subject to attorney-client confidentiality because the firm conducting the investigation, Pepper Hamilton, was doing legal work for it. Since Baylor has released parts of the Pepper Hamilton report, the judge ruled the school has waived its attorney-client privilege. Pepper Hamilton, a Philadelphia-based law firm, found \"institutional failure at every level\" at the world's largest Baptist university, including employees who did not report cases they knew about or discouraged victims from moving forward with complaints. Amidst the controversy Baylor fired football coach Art Briles, ousted university president Ken Starr and accepted the resignation of athletic director Ian McCaw.\n\nCaroline Wozniacki outlasted top-ranked Karolina Pliskova 7-5, 6-7 (3), 6-4 in a women's quarterfinal Friday at the Rogers Cup. The start of the match was delayed for more than two hours because of rain and three more weather interruptions followed once play began at Aviva Centre. In the deciding set, Wozniacki broke at love to get back on serve at 4-4. She held serve and followed with another break to reach the final four at the Toronto event for the first time. The match ended a little more than five hours after the players took to the court in the early afternoon for the pregame warmup. Actual match time was 2 hours, 56 minutes. Pliskova, from the Czech Republic, was playing her first tournament as world No. 1.\n\nAnother rainy day led to delays in the resumption of first-round play Friday at the Web.com Charity Championship in Springfield, Mo. When play was finally suspended because of darkness, Tyler Duncan had moved up the leaderboard and tied overnight leader Conrad Shindler at 9 under. Duncan and Shindler are one in front of Chris Naegel, K.H. Lee, Talor Gooch, Scott Harrington, Martin Piller and Austin Cook (Jonesboro, Arkansas Razorbacks). The second round will resume at 7:20 a.m. Central today. Matt Atkins (Henderson State) had yet to start his second round Friday. Taylor Moore (Razorbacks) was 1 under after 11 holes. Ethan Tracy (Razorbacks) was 1 under after 8. Zack Fischer (Little Rock) was even through 5. Andrew Landry (Razorbacks) even through 11. Sebastian Cappelen (Razorbacks) was even through 6.\n\nMiami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has agreed to sell the franchise for $1.2 billion to a group led by New York businessman Bruce Sherman and former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, and Major League Baseball was expected to receive the written agreement Friday, according to a New York-based MLB source.\n\nSherman, a wealthy venture capitalist who has a home in New York and is building a home in South Florida, will be the \"control person,\" similar to a managing general partner. Jeter, the former New York Yankees star shortstop, will run the business and baseball sides of the organization, the source said.\n\nThe Sherman/Jeter group has about 16 investors and they have raised the money to purchase the team after months of seeking investors to meet Loria's asking price, the source said.\n\nA purchase agreement with the Sherman/Jeter group, which has been worked on for months, was expected to be completed Friday and submitted to MLB offices in New York.\n\nSherman, a Marlins fan, increased his investment in the bid after wealthy Chicago businessman Richard Chaifetz backed out of the deal.\n\nJeter is believed to be contributing only $25 million of his own money but has a great relationship with Sherman, who will allow Jeter to essentially run the organization.\n\nMLB officials are expected to discuss the sale, but not vote on it, during owners meetings in Chicago next week. Sherman and possibly Jeter are expected to meet with the ownership committee prior for a full vote of owners, which is the final required step for the sale's completion.\n\nThe vote could be weeks away, with closing expected the first week of October.\n\nMiami businessman Jorge Mas also pursued the team and met with Marlins officials this week, but did not match the $1.2 billion bid of the Sherman/Jeter group.\n\nNew York businessman Wayne Rothbaum, who led a competing group that included former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, also bid for the Marlins before stopping his pursuit earlier this week.\n\nLoria has owned the team since 2002 and won a World Series in 2003, but the Marlins haven't made the playoffs since then, the second-longest postseason drought in Major League Baseball behind the Seattle Mariners.\n\nLoria decided to sell the team for personal reasons and has been seeking a buyer for months.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-03", "textEnd": 584, "textStart": 578}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-10", "textEnd": 1502, "textStart": 1494}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 2599, "textStart": 2592}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "textEnd": 2739, "textStart": 2732}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T16:21:00Z", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "title": "ArkansasOnline", "id": "766"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:21:00", "url": "http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/aug/12/wire/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8816194", "image": "http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/08/11/resized_250499-2ctannehillmugbw_33-23444_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "16:21:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Cutler?\n\nYes, remember last week I was only pushing for Colin Kaepernick as a backup to Matt Moore.\n\nCutler was the best quarterback available, he is better than Moore and if you have faith in second-year head coach Adam Gase then you have to trust his judgment - that he would not have pushed so hard to make this happen unless he needed him.\n\nWhether it works out or not, Miami has virtually no money guaranteed to any QB after this season. The organization can go in any direction they want at that position in 2018 with little to no salary cap issues.\n\n***\n\nSo now the NFL is getting tough on domestic violence at Ezekiel Elliott and the Dallas Cowboys expense. Great. The problem is they have been either soft, inconsistent or both on this issue forever.\n\nMore: David Moulton: Second chances in sports no easy call\n\nNow when the league is doing the right thing, Elliott and the Cowboys can justifiably say, \"you only suspended Giants kicker Josh Brown a game last year and he emotionally and physically harmed his wife for years. Why do I get six games?\"\n\nThe NFL has no defense for that. Unfortunately for Zeke and the Cowboys, they don't have to. The NFLPA gave Commissioner Roger Goodell virtually unchecked power in their last labor deal and the new player-conduct policy clearly states, the league can suspend any player six games for domestic violence. Elliott may challenge and sue the league, a la Tom Brady, but it is unlikely he will win.\n\nCowboys fans can be exasperated with the NFL over their past inconsistencies, but they also should direct some of their emotion toward their Hall of Fame owner (what a joke that is) who consistently supports players who behave this way.\n\n***\n\nDerek Jeter - although the money behind the deal is long-time Naples resident Bruce Sherman - is the new owner of the Miami Marlins.\n\nWhat kind of an owner will he be? Hey, four drunks at the end of the bar can run a franchise better than Jeffrey Loria ran the Marlins and the guy before him orchestrated the first fire sale. So Jeter, if he's mediocre, will seem amazing. However, I always hoped Jeter would buy into the Rays.\n\nMore: Signing Kaepernick would be good football sense for the Dolphins\n\nIf the franchise is going to survive, never mind thrive in Tampa-St Pete, it needs a new stadium in or near Tampa. Who would have brought more cachet than Jeter, a Tampa resident, to make that happen?\n\nJeter in Tampa and Cuban-American Miami billionaire businessman Jorge Mas owning the Marlins seemed like a better double play combo for the future of MLB in Florida. Better than Jeter/Sherman in Miami and the Rays still floundering at the gate, last in attendance despite being in the playoff chase, with seemingly no hope on the horizon.\n\n***\n\nFinally, something very troubling took place on the local sports scene this week. FSW Athletic Director Carl McAloose was reassigned.\n\nOn top of that, the reason publicly given was a joke. The man who got the athletic department off the ground in the last 3\u00bd years, raised the money to build a new basketball arena, brought the City of Palms tourney on campus, is now being asked, according to FSW Director of Communications Teresa Araque, to \"do various research-based projects.\n\nHow do our students compare GPA-wise to other colleges in the state?\n\nThese are the types of questions we haven't yet had the chance to address.\n\nWell, I'm sure he can get that answer by lunch. Please tell me there is anything other than what this looks like from the outside.\n\nBecause it looks ridiculous.\n\nPresident Jeffery Allbritten, clearly you wanted to make a change but I sure hope you know what you are doing. You just changed the face and direction of your athletic department and ensured that everyone who works in it will be looking for a new job, ASAP.\n\nAlso, the next time you make a major move like this, don't be out of town and unavailable for comment. It's insulting to the fans/boosters/student-athletes of FSW.

If you didn't, are you living under a rock? The New York Yankees former shortstop now has a new favorite team.\n\nIt was announced yesterday that the Miami Marlins will now be in the hands of the reliable shortstop.\n\nThat's right, we'll have to get used to seeing Derek Jeter in Miami. The franchise will be sold for $1.2 billion to a group consisting of Jeter and New York businessman Bruce Sherman.\n\nMichael Jordan himself is also reported to be one of the investors, according to USA Today.\n\nNow that Jeter is a co-owner of a franchise of his own, what will his first move be? CBS sports has an idea.\n\nWhile we can fawn over the success of the past, we can also look at the excitement that is to come in the future. That excitement comes in the form of No. 4 prospect in the system, Estevan Florial.\n\nThe Yankees may not be hitting bombs but Florial sure is. Now we can see why they didn't want to include him in any trade packages.\n\nWATCH: Estevan Florial crushes his 1st HR as a Tampa Yankee! A solo shot in the 1st. #Yankees pic.twitter.com/Q0X23VLMib\n\n-- Tampa Yankees (@TampaYankees) August 12, 2017\n\nThis bomb to right field marked his first home run with the Single-A Tampa Yankees, with hopefully many more to come.\n\nAnd now to the injury portion of the Buzz. It was announced yesterday by the PR department that the Yankees would be placing southpaw CC Sabathia on the 10-day DL and moving a few others to accommodate.\n\nJordan Montgomery, who was just sent down, will be likely making the spot start in Sabathia's place in a Sunday night showdown against the Red Sox.\n\nThat's what happens in baseball...no matter who gets sent down, there's always a chance they'll be right back up in the majors.\n\nSo, there you have it! Following up a HUGE victory over the Red Sox, this is just what we needed. Now, time to face Drew Pomeranz and pull out another victory.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 1249, "textStart": 1234}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T10:27:00Z", "sim": 0.4431372582912445, "source": {"uri": "elitesportsny.com", "title": "Elite Sports NY", "id": "10397"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:56:00", "url": "http://elitesportsny.com/2017/08/12/new-york-yankees-bomber-buzz-81217-new-jeter-era-emerges/", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8825768", "image": "http://cdn.elitesportsny.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-683657526.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "10:27:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

With new ownership, some changes are expected, including one that might sadden fans of sculptures that light up, spray water, and make fish paintings fly. According to Jon Heyman of FanRag Sports, the home run sculpture that lives in Marlins Park might be going away:\n\nOne thing someone connected to the Jeter group has suggested will likely go: the home run sculpture in left-center field that was designed by artist Red Grooms and has been the subject of controversy.\n\nThe controversy being that there exists a thing that looks like this:\n\nOur own Grant Brisbee was not a fan of the home run sculpture when it was first announced six years ago, saying that if \"Carnival and Las Vegas had a baby, this would be the placenta.\" It surely looks like that, as well as someone's rejected idea for a state fair ride.\n\nWhen Grant went to this year's All-Star Game, he spent some time with the sculpture and retracted his previous disgust:\n\nAnd now I'm here to express regret. I'm here to offer my sincerest apologies, an earnest mea culpa. As 500-foot home runs whizzed by the sculpture in the 2017 Home Run Derby, some of them clonking off the face, which made fans cheer wildly, as if the batter had just won some sort of special carnival prize, I was in. As I stood underneath, with the rivets and girders, with mecha-flamingos eyeing me hungrily, I was in awe.\n\nThis thing is incredible. It's perfect.\n\nSo just when Grant was in love with the Home Run Sculpture, there's now word that it'll be removed in the Derek Jeter era. Life can be cruel.\n\nMaybe the Jeter group will change its mind, and the Marlins get to show off their colorful, metallic, tropical island. But if we're nearing the end of the sculpture, all I ask is that it get auctioned off in hopes that someone will give it a loving home.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355778", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:17:00Z", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "title": "SB Nation", "id": "962"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:24:00", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/8/12/16138042/miami-marlins-derek-jeter-home-run-sculpture-nothing-lasts-forever", "storyUri": "eng-3355778", "id": "8834366", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-ruPK7f7qLKoX0cXpiDAQt8nzg=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56165847/142287522.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

owners' meeting in Chicago, Samson said Saturday. He anticipates major league owners will approve the deal in September, and closing will take place shortly after the end of the regular season.\n\nJeter plans be a limited partner in the group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, who will be the controlling owner. Jeter, a 14-time All-Star shortstop, will be in charge of the business and baseball operations, Samson said.\n\n\"I've gotten to know him through this process,\" Samson said. \"He's an incredibly interesting, articulate, smart, contemplative individual. Forget about Hall of Famer, it's not about that, it's about his ability to run a team and his desire to run a team, and it just came through so clearly what he wanted.\"\n\nAt least 75 percent of the major league clubs must approve the sale by Jeffrey Loria, who has owned the team since 2002. A person familiar with the agreement said Friday the Jeter-Sherman group includes more than 10 entities.\n\nSherman spent much of his financial career in New York and has a home in Naples, Florida.\n\nSamson said he hasn't discussed his own status with Sherman or Jeter, although there have been reports he'll remain with the organization.\n\n\"I have been here since 2002,\" Samson said. \"I love it here.

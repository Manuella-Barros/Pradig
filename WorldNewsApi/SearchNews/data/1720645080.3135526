{"id": 231340938, "title": "Swanson: Michael Cooper continues offering Hall of Fame wisdom", "text": "What makes a Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer, you ask? Hard to say exactly, the criteria has always been impossible to pinpoint, decided by mystery voters who don\u2019t seem necessarily to be following a specific recipe. But you know it when you see it. And Michael Cooper is it. Not only because of his contributions to the Lakers\u2019 five NBA championships between 1980 and 1988. Or his inclusion on eight NBA All-Defensive teams. Or that 1987 Defensive Player of the Year award. It\u2019s all that. And much more. It\u2019s all that and the fact that since he retired from the NBA in 1990, Cooper has been a prolific steward of the game, paying it forward one coaching opportunity at a time. He\u2019s taught and mentored NBA players, WNBA players, collegians and preps. The only level he hasn\u2019t coached yet \u2013 yet, Cooper stressed \u2013 is community college. Oh, and he\u2019s worked with kids too, shared his vast insight with youngsters at camps in his hometown of Pasadena, in Albuquerque where he went to college at the University of New Mexico and, last summer, in Long Beach. His pal, Greg Smith, invited him to out for the inaugural BBallers Hoops Pro Camp, a summertime offshoot of a growing youth program Smith started initially in a Long Beach church parking lot during COVID. Last summer\u2019s camp was \u201coff the hook,\u201d Smith said. \u201cJust being able to give kids an opportunity touch someone like Mike, who they\u2019d never be able to touch otherwise, is an amazing opportunity.\u201d It went so well that Cooper will be back this summer, high socks pulled up, at Alpert Jewish Community Center in Long Beach. Cooper, 68, will again take time to tutor and offer tips, to school these youngsters and sign autographs for them. He\u2019ll spend three weeklong sessions beginning July 15 inspiring boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 11, neophyte hoopers who will be learning the game not just from a Lakers great who\u2019s really hoping that the Dallas Mavericks can keep the Boston Celtics from winning an 18th NBA title \u2013 but from a soon-to-be Hall of Famer who\u2019s really hoping the Mavs can keep the Celtics from winning an 18th NBA title. Cooper will be inducted Aug. 17, in Springfield, Mass., going in as part of a 13-member class that also includes big basketball names like Vince Carter, Seimone Augustus and Chauncey Billups. Also, for the third time, Jerry West \u2013 another former Lakers great who will be inducted this time as a \u201ccontributor\u201d after previously being recognized as a player and as a member of the 1960 Olympic team. See!? These Hall of Fame cooks are eyeballing it as they go about concocting this exquisite, international basketball stew, persnickety details be damned. Like, say, dates. I mean, they called up Cooper \u2013 who was previously a Hall of Fame finalist in 2021 and 2022 \u2013 to tell him the good news on April 1. On April 1! \u201cThe other times I got that call, I was denied, so I was saying, \u2018That\u2019s a cruel joke on April Fool\u2019s Day!\u2019\u201d the former Pasadena High great said. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018No, Coop, you got in!\u2019\u201d I don\u2019t even know where to start! I tried to wait until Saturday\u2026but I just can\u2019t hold the news ? I\u2019m so so thrilled that my Showtime running mate and one of my best friends Michael Cooper has been elected into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame!! Coop is the greatest\u2026 pic.twitter.com/54K0S0znWa \u2014 Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) April 5, 2024 Cooper said he\u2019s certain the honor has as much to do with his contributions after his playing career as anything he accomplished on the court (he averaged 8.9 points, 4.2 assists and 1.2 steals per game during his 12-season NBA career, all with the Lakers.) And that makes it all the more rewarding. \u201cThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame is not about how many points you had or how many dunks, it\u2019s about what you\u2019ve done to improve this game and help grow it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had an opportunity to do that at almost every level.\u201d Including, of course, the upper echelon of women\u2019s basketball. Cooper came aboard as the Sparks\u2019 head coach in 2000, winning consecutive WNBA titles in 2001 and 2002. He called that the \u201cmost memorable\u201d time he had coaching, getting in on the ground floor of a league that\u2019s now gaining notably more traction among American sports fans. \u201cTo see where the WNBA is today makes me feel proud, like I was in in on that when people said that league wouldn\u2019t stand and wouldn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now here they are, in their (27th) season.\u201d Following with his initial coaching gig as a Lakers assistant and the first of two tenures with the Sparks, Cooper has worked as a coach with the Denver Nuggets, the USC women (he thinks JuJu Watkins could go pro today if she was so incentivized), the G League\u2019s Albuquerque Thunderbirds, the WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream, the Chadwick School Dolphins and, most recently, the Culver City High School Centaurs. The thing about developing talent across all those stages? It boils down to the same thing: \u201cGetting players to understand that what you put into his game, you\u2019ll definitely get out,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThat\u2019s something Greg and I will try to tell these kids: Your hard work pays off.\u201d (The BBallers Hoops camp, by the way, isn\u2019t outlandishly priced. There are three five-day sessions, running $250 per player per session, with scholarships available: bballershoops.com/scholarships.) \u201cAs long as we can instill that mindset to work, whether it\u2019s in class or on the basketball court or in your religious life, you have to work hard,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s the linking chain through all these, from high school to the pros, from women to men, keep working hard and try to get better every single day.\u201d OK, you ask, but what about defense? That comes down to some fundamental principles too, he said: Stay low. Keep your feet moving. Back straight. And once you get that down you can work on cutting off your opponents\u2019 oxygen on the court. Figuratively. I think. Those are lessons even a future Hall of Famers have to learn. Certainly can\u2019t hurt to have a Hall of Famer doing the teaching.", "summary": "Before the former Lakers great and Sparks coach is inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, he'll spend time working with kids at a Long Beach camp", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/08/swanson-michael-cooper-continues-offering-hall-of-fame-wisdom/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24097647453398.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:30:22", "author": "Mirjam Swanson", "authors": ["Mirjam Swanson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.23}

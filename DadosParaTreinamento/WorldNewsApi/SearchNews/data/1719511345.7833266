With ex-Rangers midfielders Glen Kamara and Joe Aribo starting for their respective teams, it was Leeds who entered the play-off final as favourites following a dominant 4-0 win over Norwich City in the semi-final. However, it was the Saints who emerged victorious thanks to a fine first half strike from Adam Armstrong. Southampton, who are managed by ex-Rangers defender Russell Martin, sprung a surprise when he opted to leave Scotland striker Che Adams on the bench and instead included ex-international team mate Ryan Fraser, who was given a starting berth on the right-wing for the Saints. Fellow Scotland international Ross Stewart was also included in the squad for Southampton, though he was not required as his side returned to the English top-tier. A fourth Scotland player, Stuart Armstrong, missed out for Saints through injury but has been included in Steve Clarke\u2019s Euro 2024 squad alongside Adams with Fraser and Stewart missing out. It took the Saints just 24 minutes to take the lead in London when ex-Newcastle United academy player Armstrong latched onto a superb through ball from Will Smallbone and finished with aplomb into the far corner of Illan Meslier\u2019s net. Replacing Fraser on the 70 minute mark, Adams almost saw himself become the villain when he found himself in all sorts of bother deep in his own half before fouling his man in order to stop Leeds\u2019 forward line breaking forward. They had to survive a number scares late too, with Daniel Farke\u2019s side smashing an effort off the crossbar through Dan James on 84 minutes before the Welsh international played a lovely one two only to fire millimetres wide as Leeds frantically searched for an equaliser. However, it was Martin\u2019s south coast side that held on for a mammoth win that will see a trio of Scotland internationals play their football in the English top flight next season. The Saints will now join Leicester City and Ipswich Town in the top tier of English football next year. Meanwhile, Farke\u2019s Leeds outfit become the only relegated side not to bounce back at the first time of asking.", "summary": "<p>Southampton have been promoted back to the English Premier League after defeating Leeds United in the EFL Championship play-off final at Wembley.</p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/international/scotland-euro-2024-star-enjoys-dream-day-at-wembley-as-ex-rangers-men-suffer-contrasting-play-off-emotions-4643121", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/05/26/16/01/GettyImages-2154735974.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:58:39", "author": "Graham Falk", "authors": ["Graham Falk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.014}

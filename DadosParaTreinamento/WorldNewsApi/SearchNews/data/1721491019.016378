{"id": 237072930, "title": "Orioles, Yankees standing in AL class of their own should bring rare level of fun", "text": "The Orioles are legit, again. The Orioles won 101 games last year. The Orioles \u2014 who\u2019d finished 40 games behind the Yankees as recently as 2021, when they\u2019d lost 110 baseball games \u2014 finished 19 games ahead of the Yankees in 2023. It was one of the most adorable stories in baseball in years until the Orioles collided with the runaway train the Texas Rangers had become in October, losing three straight in the AL Division Series, a quiet end to a big, boisterous year at Orioles Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles are even better this year. They are 47-24, which is a pace for 107 wins. They are tied with the Yankees in the loss column, something that looks like a misprint given how dominating the Yankees have been across the first 2 \u00bd months of the season \u2014 a dominance that was notably interrupted from April 29-May 2, when the Orioles took three of four in Baltimore and held the fearsome Yankees offense to six runs in four games. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d said Aaron Judge, who was revealed to be the leading All-Star vote-getter in all of Major League Baseball Monday afternoon. \u201cAnother great ballclub. I\u2019m excited to see them in The Bronx. It\u2019s going to be a fun series, and fans are going to be excited.\u201d They ought to be. There is something to be said about the near-certainty Yankees fans have enjoyed against most of the opponents they\u2019ve squared up with this year, notwithstanding the unexpected weekend O-fer they took Saturday and Sunday in Boston. You\u2019ve mostly been able to set your watch by the Yankees. In another time, with another group of high-powered Yankees, the team\u2019s owner, Col. Jacob Ruppert, famously said, \u201cThe perfect afternoon at Yankee Stadium? It\u2019s when the Yankees score eight runs in the first inning and then slowly pull away.\u201d These Yankees have come awful close, on a lot of nights, to honoring that brash decree, and there\u2019s a time and a place for a timely homestand against the Twins, against the Tigers, against the White Sox. But there\u2019s also something to be said about playing three games like this which will bring us all right to the doorstep of summer, three games against the one team in the American League that seems hellbent on pushing the Yankees across every day of summer, on into the fall. If it seems inevitable that there\u2019s to be an October collision between these teams that will be the only thing anyone remembers, that\u2019s fine too. Those were the ground rules against the Red Sox every year, too, at that point in this ancestral rivalry when they were the clear Alydar and Affirmed of the American League. Octobers provided the most drama. But Sox-Yanks was every bit as entertaining \u2014 and every bit as much of a shadow box \u2014 when the games took place in those years in April, June and August. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good team,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after Sunday\u2019s 9-3 loss at Fenway Park. \u201cThey\u2019re very complete. They\u2019ve had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well. They continue to get good starting pitching. They\u2019ve been able to close out games. And they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\u201d Boone was talking about the Orioles, but he easily could\u2019ve been describing his own team, too, across the board for the season\u2019s first 74 games, and that\u2019s what makes this series so intriguing. The Orioles can match up against the Yankees and the Yankees can match up against the Orioles, and that\u2019s meant a lot of days and nights \u2014 a lot of weeks, actually \u2014 where if the Yankees were so inclined to look at the out-of-town scoreboard they\u2019d notice the Orioles winning again, and if the Orioles were similarly inclined they\u2019d see the Yankees up 7-2 on some overmatched club. Again. For now in the American League, it is the Yankees and the Orioles, and the Orioles and the Yankees. The Guardians are only one game back in the loss column, but we\u2019ve already seen plenty of the AL Central. We know all about the Yankees\u2019 17-2 mark against the AL JV; the Orioles are also a healthy 11-2. And is anyone truly scared about how well the Mariners are playing out West? No, until proven otherwise it\u2019s the Yankees and the Orioles in one place, and everyone else in the other. Which is why watching them play baseball against one another in the same place the next three games ought to be such a delight. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a good one,\u201d Yankees catcher Jose Trevino said. \u201cComing back to The Bronx, after a road trip, facing a good team it\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d He\u2019s right about that. See you there.", "summary": "Until proven otherwise it\u2019s the Yankees and the Orioles in one place, and everyone else in the other.

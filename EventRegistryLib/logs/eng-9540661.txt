Once Jones got to the bottom of the escalator the fight continued as another man began pounding away at the Harlem rapper while he was still fighting off the first guy who seemingly started the entire situation.\n\nPer TMZ:\n\nA woman rushes to turn off the escalator, but the fight continues despite protests from others hoping to get away from the violent scene.\n\nFinally, a pair of officers break up the fight ... with Jim letting go of the man he's holding pretty quick -- who appears to be gushing blood BTW. He protests, yelling, \"It's two of them against me,\" but he allows the officer to lead him away and sit him in a chair.\n\nOne of the other individuals isn't quite so calm ... trying to pull out of a sheriff's deputy's grasp -- though more officers arrive on the scene and stop him from going any further.\n\nWe reached out to Jim who tells TMZ Hip Hop ... \"I was minding my business and defended myself. They got what they were looking for.'\n\nIn the video Jones kept telling the officers that the men assaulted him. As he took his seat, the man who Jones was fighting was acting belligerent and giving the officers a hard time. Seems like Jim Jones was indeed standing up for himself if that man's behavior is any indication.\n\nOur only question is, where was Jones' peoples? It's not like him to roll around alone. Had he been with his crew, it would've been a wrap for those old men. Just sayin'.\n\nPeep Jones speak on the situation below -- he says he's \"alright.\"\n\nJim Jones Gets Into A Brawl With 2 Men In An Airport was originally published on hiphopwired.com", "source": {"uri": "theurbandaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Urban Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "o_mazariego@theurbandaily.com", "name": "O Mazariego", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jones (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escalator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballin'_(Young_Jeezy_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballin' (Young Jeezy song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Fly_High", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "We Fly High"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Office_Products/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Office Products/Furniture", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/05/17150155250147.jpg?w=640&strip=all&quality=85", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540661", "eventUri": "eng-9540661", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The rapper took to social media on Saturday, May 4 to address the altercation that occurred over the weekend.\n\nIn the self-taken clip, Jim repeatedly told his followers that he's \"aight.\" He said, \"I'm aight. Give me a second, I gotta get dressed for this party.\" He added in the brief video, \"I'll be right with y'all. Promise you, I'm aight.\" He also added in a comment on Instagram, \"To all my family I am good love yal way to many calls n text to reply to God is good.\"\n\nA video of the brawl on an escalator at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport surfaced earlier on Saturday. In the clip, a man is seen lunging towards him, sending both of them flying down the escalator and taking out a seemingly innocent bystander.\n\nThe fight escalated as both men threw punches at each other. A woman rushed to turn off the escalator, but the fight continued before another man joined in until airport security got involved and broke it up.\n\nJim quickly let go of the man he's holding pretty though he protested that he wasn't the one who instigated the fight. \"There's two of them against me!\" he said. \"He assaulted me! They both assaulted me!\" He allowed the officer to lead him away and sit him in a chair.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the other individuals wasn't quite so calm. He tried to pull out of a sheriff's deputy's grasp before more officers arrived on the scene and stopped him going any further. One the man was heard telling the officers, \"He hurt my friend.\"\n\nIt's unclear what prompted the fight, but Jim claimed that he acted in self-defense. \"I was minding my business and defended myself.

You can see visibly that one man is bleeding from the head.\n\nJim is ordered to sit down but one of the men starts getting physical with the officers who warn the man to calm down.\n\nIt's unclear what started the fight but the Harlem rhymer reportedly tells TMZ that he was simply defending himself. \"I was minding my business and defended myself. They got what they were looking for,\" he told the media outlet.\n\nHours after his airport fight video went viral, the former Dipset member jumped on Instagram Live to address his violent altercation with two men.\n\nIn the clip below, shared by The Shade Room, Jim calmly informs his fans that he's okay. \"I'm i-ight,\" he says. \"Give me a second, I gotta get dressed for this party. I'll be right with y'all. Promise you. I'm i-ight.\"\n\nIn another video, Jim Jones is outside a Taboo nightclub in Miami where he was booked to host an event. The rap veteran is dripped out in diamond-flushed necklaces and bracelets along with a huge diamond \"VL\" ring.\n\n\"And the show must go on,\" he tells his fans. \"F**k all that other s**t.\"", "source": {"uri": "xxlmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XXL Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trent_fitzgerald@xxlmag.com", "name": "Trent Fitzgerald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jones (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escalator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taboo (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shade_Room", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Shade Room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Diplomats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/05/attachment-jim-jones-airport-fight.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540661", "eventUri": "eng-9540661", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 99, "textEnd": 104}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The rapper has now given fans a quick update as the footage makes its rounds online, assuring them that he's just fine. In a new clip, he repeats that he's \"aight,\" and doesn't look to have any visible cuts or bruises. Moreover, he told them that he was about to get ready to go to a party.\n\nBased on his Instagram Story, he was scheduled to appear at a Miami nightclub on the evening of the altercation.

Rapper Justifies Actions as Self-Defense | WATCH-it-Happen", "body": "*In a dramatic incident at a South Florida airport, Jim Jones found himself in the heat of a tussle over the weekend and of course, TMZ has video of it (watch above).\n\nThe rapper from Harlem was filmed riding an escalator alongside two companions at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport when a scuffle broke out with another individual, resulting in a tumble down the steps and an ensuing brawl.\n\nThe altercation escalated to the point where Jones and his opponent ended up on the ground at the escalator's base, prompting the intervention of a group of officers to quell the violence.\n\nOne individual was left bloodied in the aftermath. Reflecting on the incident, Jones was quoted in a statement to TMZ saying, \"I was minding my business and defended myself. They got what they were looking for.\"\n\nJones has been at the center of numerous headlines this year. In March, he stirred controversy by taking aim at Sean Diddy Combs in his On The Radar freestyle.\n\nIn a pointed verse, he rapped, \"I seen you rap btches and rap n****s inside that n***a's house. Now, you acting different. I should air you n****s out.\" These lyrics emerged in the wake of multiple individuals accusing the Bad Boy mogul of misconduct.

The only thing louder than Kendrick's latest Drake diss is the viral bloody bodyslam Jim Jones delivered while fighting off two men on an airport escalator. What is it? The braids?\n\nWhile other rappers were beefing in the booth and their tweets, Jim Jones was throwing \"We Fly High\" haymakers in the streets. It doesn't get much more real in the field than risking it all with an airport brawl, but Jimmy says it was \"self-defense.\" He fought off not one but two alleged aggressors at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nAccording to TMZ, before the three men could reach the lower level, all hell broke loose on an escalator. It's unclear how the fight started, but it looked like one man behind Jim had already gotten physical with him before the clip began. The commotion from what appeared to be a swing and a miss at the LHHNY alum knocked his at off.\n\nIn return, the rapper picked up his attacker, and Diplomats dropped him on his head.\n\nThe airborne assailant knocked into other people, including an elderly man who fell and couldn't get up. Jim continued swinging as a man in a baseball cap, seemingly traveling with the fallen senior, tried to jump the New York native. The puny punches from behind didn't do damage as Jones held his own against both of them.\n\n\"Y'all jumping me?\" Jim yelled before security broke it all up. \"It's two of them against me!\"\n\nJim's hard-hitting punches left his balding brawler bloody and so furious the man tried swinging at a female security guard. The gushing guy definitely looked aggressive while the \"RICH HUSTLE\" rapper pleaded to security.\n\n\"They're jumping me! He assaulted me! They both assaulted me,\" Jim explains while calmly sitting down and complying with authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the unidentified instigator continued swinging and screaming at multiple members of law enforcement. It must be nice to have the complexion for protection and expect to get away with assaulting cops.\n\nThe men who jumped Jim are lucky he was flying solo because we know his boo Chrissy has hands.\n\nJim addressed the incident in a statement to clear the air and clear his name.\n\n\"I was minding my business and defended myself. They got what they were looking for,\" he explained.\n\nLocal police did not yet confirm whether the airport altercation resulted in any arrests, but BOSSIP will keep you posted.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jones (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escalator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Fly_High", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "We Fly High"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Braid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bossip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/05/17149246224837.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540661", "eventUri": "eng-9540661", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

First reported by TMZ, the Harlemite can be seen in the video riding the escalator and attempting to make his way to the bottom. Two white men can be seen standing on the escalator near Jones before things quickly escalate to violence.\n\nThe Dipset rapper is later seen hitting one of the men with a modified German Suplex on the moving escalator, sending him flying down the metal contraption. Another man quickly joins the brawl and begins hitting Jones in his head with a flurry of blows. Airport security intervenes and breaks up the fight, with one of the security guards hauling Jim away. Jim Jones is heard trying to plead his case, yelling, \"It's two of them against me! They jumped me, they both assaulted me, both of them assaulted me.\"\n\nAs Jones sat down, one of the white men began swinging on one of the security guards, with the two of the authorities moving in to restrain him. It's currently unclear what started the fight, but the emcee told TMZ he was acting in self-defense. \"I was minding my business and defended myself. They got what they were looking for,\" he said, detailing the ordeal that left the two men bloody.\n\nJones has yet to address the seemingly random encounter directly, but he did decide to pop out for a night in Miami just a day later. The El Capo artist spoke on Instagram to seemingly brush off the fight, unfazed by getting jumped by the unnamed men. \"And the show must go on you heard,\" he said with a smirk on his face. \"Tonight, Taboo, you know where I'm at, ya dig, f**k all that other sh*t. Pull up on me, ya dig, I got it on, I hope you got it on -- we gon have a celebration.

TMZ reports that Young Thug's ex-lover Cleopatra Dues hit the Zone 2 precinct in Fulton County to file a police report on the singer.\n\nHer document stated that Mariah allegedly attacked her at the Cavo Kitchen and Cocktail Lounge. The artist, n\u00e9e Mariah Amani Buckles, was arrested and booked on Wednesday (May 1) following Dues' report. The report explained that Buckles attacked her \"for no apparent reason.\"\n\nMariah and Cleopatra's fight went viral on March 28, showing both women being separated after scrapping on the ground.

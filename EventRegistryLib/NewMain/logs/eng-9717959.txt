The company announces an upsizing in the special warrant offering to $3.5 million. The company announces an additional non-brokered $0.15 private placement unit offering with a four-month hold totaling $341,250.\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC, OTCQB: AKEMF) (\"AEMC\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the closing of the first tranche of the previously announced non-brokered offering of 22,255,429 special warrants (the \"Special Warrants\") issued at the price of $0.15 per Special Warrant for gross proceeds of approximately $3,338,314 (the \"Offering\"). The Offering has been increased from $3,000,000 to up to $3,500,000.\n\nEach Special Warrant will automatically convert into one unit of the Company (each a \"Unit\"), as described below. Each Unit shall consist of one common share of the Company (a \"Share\") and one common share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Share at a price of $0.20 per Share for a period of three years following the date of issue.\n\nEach Special Warrant will automatically convert, for no additional consideration, into Units on the date that is the earlier of: (i) the date that is three business days following the date on which the Company files a prospectus supplement to a short form base shelf prospectus with the applicable securities regulatory authorities qualifying distribution of the Units underlying the Special Warrants (the \"Prospectus Supplement\"), and (ii) the date that is four months and one day after the closing of the Offering.\n\nThe Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the Prospectus Supplement within 60 days of the closing of the Offering (not including the date of closing), provided, however, that there is no assurance that a Prospectus Supplement will be filed with the securities commissions, prior to the expiry of the statutory four-month hold period.\n\nThe Company paid aggregate cash finder's fees of approximately $181,261 to certain finders, being 7% of the gross proceeds raised by each such finder. As additional compensation the Company issued an aggregate of 1,208,409 non-transferable broker warrants (each a \"Broker Warrant\") to such finders. Each Broker Warrant is exercisable for one Share at the exercise price of $0.20 for a period of three years.\n\nThe net proceeds from the Offering will be used for Canwell prospect drilling at the Nikolai Nickel Project in Alaska, metallurgical studies, working capital and marketing purposes.\n\nPrior to the filing of the Prospectus Supplement and the automatic conversion of the Special Warrants, the securities issued under the Offering will be subject to a four-month hold period from the date of closing of the Offering in addition to any other restrictions under applicable law.\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that it will undertake a non-brokered private placement (\"NBPP\") of units (the \"NBPP Units\") for gross proceeds of up to $341,250. Each NBPP Unit will consist of one common share of the Company (a \"Share\") and one common share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\").

The Company intends to pay the same cash finder's fee and issue the same number of Broker Warrants as is described under the Offering. The NBPP is subject to TSX.V approval. The securities issued in connection with the NBPP will be subject to a four-month hold period, in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n\nFor additional information, visit: https://alaskaenergymetals.com/\n\nAbout Alaska Energy Metals\n\nAlaska Energy Metals Corporation is an Alaska-based corporation with offices in Anchorage and Vancouver working to sustainably deliver the critical materials needed for national security and a bright energy future, while generating superior returns for shareholders.\n\nAEMC is focused on delineating and developing the large-scale, bulk tonnage, polymetallic Eureka deposit containing nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium, iron, platinum, palladium, and gold.

Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Unit at a price of CAD$0.10 per share for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance. Each Finder Warrant is comprised of one Common Share and one Warrant.\n\nDue to increased demand, the Company has further increased the size of the Offering from CAD$1.2 million to CAD$1.4 million, which is subject to TSXV approval. The Company expects to close on the balance of the Offering on or before July 15, 2024.\n\nAll securities issued pursuant to the Second Tranche, including Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of Warrants, are and will be subject to a hold period of four months and one day after the date of closing of the Second Tranche. The Offering remains subject to TSXV final approval.\n\nThe securities described herein have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and accordingly, may not be offered or sold within the United States except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions therefrom. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy any securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nInsider Participation\n\nCertain directors of the Company have acquired Units under the Offering. Such participation is considered to be a \"related party transaction\" as defined under the policies of the TSXV and Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on exemptions from the minority shareholder approval and formal valuation requirements applicable to the related-party transactions under sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), respectively, of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market value of the Units acquired by the participating directors nor the consideration to be paid by such directors exceeds 25% of the Company's market capitalization. The Company did not file a material change report in respect of the related party transaction at least 21 days before the closing of the Second Tranche, which the Company deems reasonable in the circumstances in order to close the Offering in an expeditious manner.\n\nAbout Zodiac Gold\n\nZodiac Gold Inc.

Our patented Zaeras\u2122 long-duration energy storage technology, leveraging zinc-air chemistry, guarantees the storage and on-demand delivery of electricity without the limitations or environmental risks associated with current market leaders.\n\nAbout ABOUND's Zaeras\u2122 Technology\n\nZaeras\u2122 is precision-engineered to meet future energy requirements, with a specific emphasis on simplifying long-duration energy storage. Harnessing the potential of its multi-patented Zaeras\u2122 technology, ABOUND is poised to facilitate the seamless integration of green energy sources into the grid. This is achieved by minimizing curtailment, bridging the gap between supply and demand, and efficiently integrating green energy into the grid. ABOUND's strategic initiatives encompass opportunities for peak demand reduction, leveraging time-of-use arbitrage, participating in value stacking programs, and entering the distributed long-duration energy storage sector. These endeavors are aligned with our central objective of increasing the integration and resiliency of green energy, while stabilizing the grid.\n\nDistinguished by its inherent safety -- free from fire or explosion hazards -- Zaeras\u2122 guarantees sustained capacity over an extensive lifecycle. Simultaneously, it showcases versatility by independently managing charge and discharge operations. Comparable to other Flow Battery technologies, scaling up the energy capacity of Zaeras\u2122 is as simple as increasing the size of the fuel tank; a cost-effective solution, from kWh to MWh. This is a welcome alternative to the fixed power-to-energy ratio constraints ingrained in traditional systems, such as Li-ion and Zinc Hybrid Batteries.\n\nTo learn more about ABOUND's technology, please visit: https://Abound.Energy\n\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.

(\"Viva Gold\" or the \"Company\") (TSX Venture Exchange: VAU) is pleased to announce that it has completed the previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") described in its news release of June 10, 2024. In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,451,667 units (the \"Units\") at a price of CDN$0.15 per Unit for gross proceeds of CDN$667,750. Each Unit consists of one common share in the capital of the Company (a \"Share\") and one-half of one non-transferable common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, a \"Warrant\"). Each whole Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Share at an exercise price of CDN$0.22 per Share until July 15, 2027, which is 36 months from the date of issuance.\n\n\"This financing will allow the company to complete an updated resource estimate to include results from 50 holes drilled by Viva from 2022 to 2024 and to complete an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") study with additional value adding technical work on the Tonopah Gold project located near Tonopah, Nevada,\" Stated James Hesketh, President & CEO.\n\nInsiders of the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,725,000 Units in the Offering, which participation constituted a \"related party transaction\" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). Such participation is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the Units acquired by the insiders, nor the consideration for the Units paid by such insiders, exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. As required by MI 61 101, the Company advises that it expects to file a material change report relating to the Offering less than 21 days before completion of the Offering, which is necessary to complete the Offering in an expeditious manner and is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nViva plans to allocate the proceeds of the Offering, net of any finder's fees, towards completing technical and environmental study work at its Tonopah Gold Project (\"Tonopah\"), located in Nevada, and secondarily for general working capital purposes.\n\nThe Company will pay aggregate finder's fees of CDN$6,510 and 43,400 Share purchase warrants (the \"Finder's Warrants\") in connection with subscriptions from subscribers introduced to the Offering by Ventum Financial, Haywood Securities and Canaccord Genuity Corp. Each Finder's Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Share in the capital of the Company at an exercise price of CDN$0.22 per Share until January 15, 2026, which is 18 months from the date of issuance. The Offering remains subject to final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. The securities issued under the Offering, and any Shares that may be issuable on exercise of any such securities, will be subject to a statutory hold period expiring four months and one day from the date of issuance of such securities.\n\nAbout Viva Gold Corp\n\nThe Tonopah project is a 100%-owned land position on the prolific Walker Lane gold trend in western Nevada and is situated about a half hour drive south of the Round Mountain mine owned by Kinross Gold . Viva has consistently grown its resources since 2018 and recently completed a drill program to further define and grow the current resource base. The Company plans to update the resource model and PEA study in 2024, both of which are major catalysts and value creation events for shareholders.\n\nViva Gold is led by CEO James Hesketh, a 40-year veteran in the mining space who has led the development and construction of eight other mines around the world throughout his career. James has surrounded himself with equally experienced mining professionals both on the management team and the board.\n\nThe Tonopah Gold Project, a potential open pit, heap leach/mill opportunity, has all the hallmarks of a successful mining development project as key infrastructure is in place and is supported by compelling economic studies.\n\nPlease reach out and get to know us as 2024 is shaping up to be a transformational year.\n\nViva Gold trades on the TSX Venture exchange \"VAU\", on the OTCQB \"VAUCF\" and on the Frankfurt exchange \"7PB\". Viva currently has ~118.4 million shares outstanding and boasts a best-in-class management team and board with decades of both gold exploration and production experience. The Company is advancing its high-grade Tonopah Gold Project in mining friendly Nevada with the support of several institutional shareholders. More information can be found on https://www.Sedar.Com and please visit our website: www.vivagoldcorp.com.\n\nViva is committed to developing the Tonopah Gold Project in an environmentally and socially responsible fashion.

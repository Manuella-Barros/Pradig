Supporting these service members are 600,000 active military spouses. Military spouses play a critical \u2013 though not publicized \u2013 role in the readiness of armed forces in all countries. For US military spouses, deployed in new environments and unfamiliar cultures, and primarily responsible for home and family, it can be a demanding life. Career, in particular, is often a challenge for military spouses according to USAA. Unemployment \u2013 or underemployment \u2013 is an continuing dilemma for military spouses moving, on average, every 2.5 years. Every posting is a new start, and a new stressor. Military spouses often find themselves sacrificing their career ambitions and opportunities to support their service partner and family. Because of the frequency of moves, the unemployment rate among spouses is five times the national average\u2014and often identified as a factor in declining active-duty service. But military spouse knowledge and experience is an under-recognized asset. For example, 85% of spouses have at least some college education, 4X the US national average. A Syracuse University study found that 28% of military spouses have owned or operated a business. 75% are confident in their ability to multi-task.

It\u2019s early days were the subject of an earlier Forbes article. Time to check back following its series A investment. A high-growth startup with great potential Instant Teams continues to grow, preparing for its series B investment, and showing client companies that, combined with a smart technology layer, military spouses working remotely provide a high quality, cost-effective, experience for their customers. One that typical BPO companies are challenged to match at cost and scale. Here\u2019s the secret sauce: The experiences military spouses gain over years -earning an income, managing a household, handling frequent moves, and addressing assorted other challenges - provides a level of skill and maturity that typical BPO CX contractors have difficulty matching. Combine Instant Teams talent with the right tech and you have a solid recipe for success. The future of CX: tech and talent Rodewald and McMannes\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t have been better. Over the past decade customer experience has been recognized as a key competitive battleground. Here\u2019s what the Boston Consulting Group said about the CX transformation: \u201cDigital and data are transforming customer interactions. The customer experience has been radically altered\u2014and faces further transformation\u2014as touchpoints, on-demand services, personalization, and AI-enabled automation become more sophisticated. Leading organizations are no longer thinking of touchpoints in terms of steps along a journey, but rather as gateways to points of sale or as richer sources of engagement. Customer experience was ranked the highest-priority investment among respondents to our Build for the Future survey. Moreover, companies ranked as champions in their category demonstrated notably greater investments in customer experience than their competitors\u2014and significantly greater rewards. \u200b CEOs must embrace customer experience as a strategic differentiator and a source of competitive advantage, fundamental to the way that they run\u200b their business.\u201d According to BCG, \u201cToday\u2019s winners aren\u2019t just outperforming. They\u2019re crushing the competition. Companies leading in customer experience reap significant rewards in acquisition, spending, loyalty, advocacy, and cost efficiency.\u201d As CX moves front-of-the-line in investment and importance for corporates of all sizes, a partnership strategy is increasingly essential. Companies can\u2019t be good at everything, and expert, innovative, providers like Instant Teams make it possible for enterprises to benefit while \u201csticking to their knitting\u201d. Instant Teams is an early CX innovator Instant Teams was among the first at the starting line as CX transformed and WFH became feasible at scale. In fact, Rodewald and McMannes describe their mission this way: \u201cAs remote-first experts since 2016, we\u2019ve mastered the art of remote hiring, training, deploying, and managing teams at scale. As a customer experience marketplace, we partner with companies in sourcing from a remarkable, diverse workforce and empower military spouses with remote work. With our extensive database of pre-vetted talent, we build customized workforce solutions to support your business needs.\u201d The remote advantage is a powerful one. Recent research shows that remote workers are typically more productive and engaged than in-office workers. The distributed location of military spouses provides an obvious advantage for enterprises seeking nearshoring CX options. And startup time and cost for clients of Instant Teams is much reduced versus creating a new internal operation, hiring, orienting and training a new population, or relying on brick and mortar facilities. But great talent and WFH flexibility isn\u2019t enough. Instant Teams has trained many hundreds of its members in the specific skills required for top CX delivery: Remote work proficiency: Adapting to remote work environments Time management skills: Managing time efficiently, ensuring customer needs are promptly addressed. Team-oriented: Excellent team play in collaborative environments. Technological proficiency: Strong technical skills. Organizational skills: Attention to detail and familiarity with regulatory standards, meticulous documentation and record-keeping. Here\u2019s how team members describe themselves and their skills: \u201cI\u2019m a growth person, a go-getter. I\u2019m organized, embrace challenge, and happy to start at the bottom and work my way up.\u201d \u201cOur lives are chaotic because of regular moves and we have learned to turn chaos into order. Spouses are organizers, facilitators and decision-makers. We get things done!\u201d \u201cWe make our clients successful. We\u2019re smart, adaptable, resilient and educated. Working remotely has made it possible for me to have a career with Instant Teams, not just a job.\u201d \u201cMilitary wives are shapeshifters and fearless. We have to be. We\u2019ve learned how to hit the ground running and make it work.\u201d \u201cI have a BA and MA in English, I\u2019m a good communicator, and that helps a lot in customer issues.\u201d Talent, tech, and culture Rodewald and McMannes built their business around a powerful strategic combination: tech-enabled remote talent. The third strategic element is culture. It takes a strong, unified, culture to convert Instant Teams\u2019 tech and talent into a high-performance organization. As CEO Rodewald put it, \u201cWe share a common belief in the values instilled in US military culture - respect, professionalism, integrity, and a strong work ethic. These are the foundation for Instant Team\u2019s four values: \u201cWe Take Ownership. We take personal ownership, in all things, by working with integrity and trust. We do what we say we will do, we do not take the easy road, and we do not misrepresent ourselves for personal gain. We always do the right thing, even when it does not benefit us directly. \u201cWe team build to build teams. We build with daily demonstrations of trust, transparency, authenticity, and empathetic accountability that enhance relationships and collaboration in service to the community, each other, and customers. \u201cWe embrace change daily. We believe in continuous improvement and we don\u2019t fear change. When we show up and aim to leave things better than we found them when we started the day, this practice naturally cultivates success and growth. \u201cWe lead with intentional curiosity. We enter all interactions with curiosity. Asking questions leads to better understanding and connection between customers, teams, and community. When curiosity is front and center, inclusion and possibility follow.\u201d The customer perspective Attracting top remote talent, embracing agility, flexibility and productivity through technology, and a strong values-based culture, are the strategic ingredients Rodewald and McMannes believe will continue to attract great customers. Alight Solutions, a Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For\u00ae in 2024, offers a strong example. Rob Sturrus, Executive Vice President at Alight, described working with Instant Teams: \"We started using Instant Teams situationally to supplement our workforce. The military spouse community is very attractive to us as a workforce since Alight supports remote and flexible work arrangements. We found that Instant Teams offered a diverse pool of talent, with a variety of educational backgrounds ... We started with operations roles including backend functions and heavy volumes of processing. Instant Teams also helped us find specialized hires for sourcing and procurement, along with call center agents.\u201d Sturrus concluded this way: \"We're beating historical averages for retention,\" says Sturrus, \"and we anticipate continued stability in our workforce thanks to Instant Teams.\" Continuing to grow According to Forbes, strong customer experiences drive revenue growth, customer retention, and profitability. In turn, poor customer experience is costly: three of five consumers report switching brands because of a frustrating call center or on-line experience. Qualtrics recently estimated the cost of customer frustration at trillions of dollars annually. Seeing the prize, and the cost of inaction, 75% of companies are increasing investments in CX, partnering with service specialists to provide the talent and technology needed, and utilizing AI and ML advances to provide predictive insights. A partnership strategy is crucial for enterprises committed to remaining competitive, and top specialists continue to be in high demand. Instant Teams is among the early and important leaders meeting this demand. And, under the leadership of Rodewald and McMannes, the company continues to do well by doing good. Viva la Revolution!

However, Season 4 just addressed fans' biggest complaint about Homelander (Antony Starr).\n\nSince its first season, The Boys has underlined how Homelander is the show's ultimate antagonist. As the mightiest superhero ever created by Vought, Homelander is virtually indestructible. Since he knows his unparalleled powers, Homelander feels constantly frustrated to be treated as Vought's mascot and forced to play by society's rules. The Supe thinks of himself as a god among ants and wants nothing more than to rule the world with an iron fist.\n\nThe only thing stopping Homelander from going into a homicidal rampage and enforcing his twisted will is his pathological need for attention. In short, Homelander doesn't become a dictator using humans for amusement because he struggles to keep his public image as a fair and just savior.\n\nThe problem with this personality trait is that Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and the Boys have been pushing Homelander for three full seasons, tempting the Supe to unleash his rage and shed the mask of a good guy. Yet, Homelander keeps going back to the start, controlling his devious impulses despite his losses in the mediatic battlegrounds. Homelander's need for public love is why he hasn't slaughtered the Boys on multiple occasions, to the point where it's perceived as a kind of plot armor introduced to prolong the series' longevity. Fortunately, Episode 4 of Season 4 explains why Homelander acts this way.\n\nIn The Boys Season 4, Episode 4, Homelander returns to the lab where Vought trained him to be their perfect weapon. His goal is to confront the people who used him as a lab rat, turning his childhood into a living nightmare. By doing that, Homelander hopes to shed himself of his humanity.\n\nThe episode gives us a detailed glimpse at the cruel experiments Homelander had to endure since his birth, as Vought determined the limits of his strength and endurance. For instance, the scientist in the lab locked Homelander in an oven for hours, exposing him to unspeakable pain. Homelander was also frequently left alone in an empty room, being observed 24/7 so that the scientist could study his behavior.\n\nBy exploring Homelander's past, The Boys argue that monsters are not born; they are raised. It's no wonder the villain turned out as he is, as anyone would break under the physical and physiological torture Vought inflicted on a lonely kid. Still, the most important revelation of the episode comes from Dr. Barbara (Nancy Lenehan), who oversaw the Homelander project in the labs.\n\nAs Barbara tells Homelander, Vopught always knew they couldn't control the powerful Supe. In fact, Homelander was so strong as a child that he could have broken free from the labs anytime he wanted to. He stayed there and allowed people to torture him for years without an end due to his need for external approval. He wanted to be a good lab rat, regardless of the horrors he endured. However, Homelander wasn't born with this psychological flaw; his unquenchable thirst for love was implanted in his brain by the best psychologist Vought could pay. This explains why Homelander always goes back to playing the hero, even though, deep down, he wants to do whatever he wants without accountability.\n\nIt makes sense for Vought to mess around with Homelander's psyche to make him docile. Without a subconscious impulse to obey, Homelander could cause the end of the world. So, to turn him into the perfect product, Vought fractured his mind, a decision that might soon prove to be the company's biggest sin.\n\nHomelander has become more unhinged at each season. Nevertheless, the psychological restraints placed by Vought have kept him from snapping. The problem is that the longer he keeps his twisted compulsions bottled up, the more violent his outburst will be. Homelander has been trying to get rid of his human side for a long time. Now that he knows what Vought did to keep him in check, he has the knowledge to reverse the procedure and embrace the darkness within. It's no wonder The Boys will end its story in Season 5.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marco_vito_oddo@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Marco Vito Oddo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supe_District", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

With Billy Butcher facing a gruesome death after abusing V24 (also known as Temp V) and the events of Gen V feeding back into The Boys, Season 4 is heading into uncharted territory. One thing fans can be sure of, though, is that Homelander will likely become more unhinged.\n\nCBR VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe final moments of Season 3 saw Homelander bursting a protester's head open with his laser vision in the middle of a cheering crowd. The season finale of Gen V saw him frame the series' young heroes while saving the Supes who were causing murderous mayhem. Homelander continues to get away with blatant acts of evil with no consequences, so it's safe to say his behavior will only get worse in Season 4. While Homelander is a fan-favorite character, he is also one of the greatest threats that humanity has ever faced.\n\nThe Homelander, Explained\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Showrunner Shares Current Plan on How the Series Will End\n\nThe Boys showrunner Eric Kripke reveals what he knows at this point about the very end of the series.\n\nAntony Starr portrays The Homelander Fans might recognize him as Lucas Hood from Banshee (2013 - 2016) or Eddie Parker in Guy Ritchie's The Covenant (2023)\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to understand that The Boys is a superhero show that takes a much darker (and some might argue, more realistic) approach to the traditional superhero genre. Superheroes (Supes) in The Boys universe are commercialized. Their entire career revolves around how good they are at cultivating a positive public image. The universe features many Supes who have different abilities and popularity. The most popular superhero team is called The Seven. The Seven is The Boys' answer to DC's Justice League. Homelander is the leader of The Seven.\n\nHomelander isn't just the leader of the most prominent superhero team. Homelander is a parody of DC's Superman, one of the most powerful superheroes ever created. Notably, Homelander's costume is inspired by a mixture of Superman's suit and cape and Captain America's American patriotism. Since Homelander is The Boys' version of one of the most powerful superheroes in comic history, it's safe to say that he is also incredibly strong. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the morals of Superman or Captain America. His strength lets him do whatever he wants and he knows it. Homelander is nearly indestructible and, so far, he hasn't faced another Supe who can stand up to him.\n\nHomelander's Origins\n\nHomelander wasn't born by traditional means. Instead, he was created in a Vought lab from Soldier Boy's DNA sample. Soldier Boy was a powerful and out-of-control Supe. He was considered America's original and best hero. Soldier Boy was also the leader of Payback, the biggest superhero team before The Seven took over. Vought wanted Soldier Boy out of the way, so they decided to use him in secret to create an even more powerful Supe that they would have control over from the moment he was born. This resulted in the birth of Homelander, a boy who would grow up to be the most powerful Supe the world has ever seen.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Has a Homelander Problem\n\nHomelander is far and away the best - and most interesting - character in The Boys adaptation. But because of this, the show repeatedly faces the problem of bringing its \"heroes\" face-to-face with Homelander without any of the main characters dying (Homelander included). How many times can the show continue this dance before audiences tire of the lack of real resolution?\n\nHomelander was born sometime in the spring of 1981, but he doesn't know when his birthday is. In the show, he even explains that his birthday is just for publicity to make him seem normal and relatable. He also sarcastically says he wasn't even born, so he can't have a birthday. He was just \"poured out of a test tub.\" As a child, Homelander was called John Gillman. He was raised in the lab he was born in, surrounded by doctors and scientists like Jonah Vogelbaum. They subjected him to many experiments to test his powers, and limitations, and to prepare him for life as a powerful Supe. Although Homelander doesn't elaborate much on what his childhood was like, it's clear that his physical and mental conditioning was traumatizing.\n\nA few characters address Homelander by the name \"John\" throughout the series, including Jonah and Queen Maeve, but he doesn't go by his \"secret identity\" name anymore. When Starlight first joins The Seven and decides to leave the Tower as Annie January instead of Starlight, Homelander asks her about her secret identity. He also says that he gave up a long time ago. He lives his entire life as the Homelander, not as John Gillman.\n\nDuring his childhood, Homelander accidentally killed numerous people, mostly female tutors. In 1994, he snapped a woman's spine by accidentally hugging her too hard. Homelander also spent a lot of his time watching Soldier Boy's movies. He idolized Soldier Boy as being the greatest American hero of all time. He related to Soldier Boy because Soldier Boy was almost as powerful as him. To this day, Soldier Boy remains the only Supe that even comes close to Homelander's strength and abilities.\n\nHomelander's Role In The Seven & His Powers\n\nRelated\n\n'I Just Don't Know What to Tell You': The Boys Showrunner Responds to Homelander Advocates\n\nThe Boys showrunner Eric Kripke says any fan who sees Homelander as a hero is seriously missing the point of the series.\n\nStan Edgar, the CEO of Vought International, and Madelyn Stillwell, the Senior Vice President of Hero Management at Vought, presented John as the new leader of The Seven when Vought believed Homelander was ready. To capture the public's attention, they urged him to simply present himself as \"The Homelander,\" which is likely what led to him dropping John altogether. Shortly after being named the leader of The Seven, Homelander went on his first mission with Black Noir, an original member of Payback who was brought into The Seven.\n\nHomelander and Black Noir were sent to stop a terrorist group's occupation of a chemical plant. Homelander went in alone to make quick work of the terrorists, but in his attempt to save a hostage, he accidentally killed them by blowing up a gun with his laser eyes. The hostages were more terrified of Homelander than the terrorists. In a fit of rage, he ended up killing almost everyone. Black Noir watched everything, so Homelander tried to kill him. Their fight destroyed the plant, but much to Homelander's surprise, Black Noir agreed to cover the whole thing up with him instead of trying to turn him in. At that moment, Homelander got a taste of getting away with anything he did because he's The Homelander.\n\nThe range of Homelander's powers is horrific and extensive. Homelander is the most powerful Supe because of his raw strength, impenetrability, and range of abilities. Vought created a Supe so powerful that even other Supes couldn't take him down. His powers include:\n\nSuperhuman strength Superhuman durability (he is literally bulletproof) Superhuman speed Extremely enhanced senses, like superhuman hearing and smell Heat vision (laser vision) X-Ray vision Telescopic vision Flight Regenerative healing Genetic Superiority - Homelander has suggested that he and Queen Maeve possess \"Genetic Superiority\", which means their genes don't just surpass normal humans, they also surpass other Supes as well. He believes this to be true because his biological son, Ryan, inherited his superpowers from Homelander naturally instead of coming from Compound V, the substance used to turn human children into Supes. This particular trait is still up in the air on how legitimate it is, though.\n\nread more\n\nWhy Even Other Supes Are Afraid of Homelander\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys: 15 Homelander Quotes Fans Won't Ever Forget\n\nHomelander is one of the darkest characters in Prime Video's The Boys, and across three seasons he's said plenty of unforgettable things.\n\n\"I'm the Homelander, and I can do whatever the f*** I want.\"\n\nIn a world where superheroes exist, it's not hard to realize that a natural imbalance between humans and superhumans would become a problem. When humans aren't capable of defeating a Supe, it's up to other Supes to keep each other in check. Unfortunately, when it comes to Homelander, there isn't a Supe that can defeat him. Even a team of powerful Supes have failed to kill Homelander. Most of his conflicts end with him completely unharmed, and his enemy left in unrecognizable pieces.\n\nThe Boys' entire plot is about a group of completely normal humans who want to take Supes down and expose them for the monsters they are. The Boys' leader, Billy Butcher, has a particular grudge against Homelander for his role in the disappearance/death of Butcher's wife, Becca. Needless to say, The Boys struggle to put a dent in most Supes and have to come up with creative routes to wiggle around the fact that they're going toe-to-toe with power they don't have. It's not surprising that Butcher and his team have struggled for three seasons to kill Homelander or even strip him of any power.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys' Antony Starr Teases Anticipated Homelander vs. Butcher Showdown in Hit Series\n\nThe Boys' Homelander actor, Antony Starr, plugs his character's likely showdown with Billy Butcher and what to expect.\n\nWhat is concerning, however, is that even other Supes who have stood up to Homelander stand no chance. Starlight and Queen Maeve resort to blackmailing him with a video of him letting an entire plane of people die just to get him to back off of them and their loved ones. Both Starlight and Queen Maeve are members of The Seven, but they know they're no match for Homelander. Homelander has effortlessly executed other powerful Supes, including Supersonic, Doppelg\u00e4nger, and even Black Noir. He even effortlessly renders Blindspot's power useless by popping both his eardrums with two swift smacks to either side of his head.\n\nThe biggest proof of Homelander's power comes from his fight with Soldier Boy, Billy Butcher, and Hughie Campbell. After freeing Soldier Boy from a Soviet prison and lab, he agrees to help Butcher and his crew eliminate Homelander. Soldier Boy can produce a powerful radioactive blast that burns Compound V out of Supes' blood, rendering them completely human. At the time, Butcher and Hughie were also under the effects of Temp V, giving them both superpowers. Butcher even inherited some of Homelander's abilities, like heat vision. When all three of them confronted Homelander, Homelander still managed to thwart their efforts and escape unharmed. Three Supes, including the second most powerful Supe in the world (Soldier Boy), were not enough to kill or even impair Homelander.\n\nWith so much undeniable power, it's not surprising that Homelander believes he can do whatever he wants. He doesn't have to answer to anyone because, at the end of the day, they can't stop him. Even other Supes are beneath him. Homelander truly believes that he's a God among men and that he is so untouchable, he doesn't have to answer to anyone. If someone becomes too much of a problem, human, Supe, or even the CEO of Vought, he will figure out a way to get rid of them, either with straight-up murder, or other underhanded tactics.\n\nHomelander Is The World's Biggest Threat\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Creator Explains Why the Series Is Ending, Teases What's Next\n\nThe Boys creator and showrunner Eric Kripke teases what's next for the superhero franchise after the main series concludes its five-season run.\n\nIn Season 3, Episode 3 - \"Barbary Coast,\" Starlight reminds Homelander that she and Queen Maeve have a video of Homelander letting an entire flight of innocent passengers die. They are prepared to release it to the public to ruin Homelander's reputation. For a while, this threat worked on him. Homelander wants the public to love him. He wants people to see him as a hero and a symbol of justice. He craves that love from the world because he never had it as a child. However, after some time, Homelander realizes that he doesn't need to worry about their threats. In response to Starlight's blackmail, Homelander says:\n\n\"Go ahead. Release it. Let's light this candle, huh? I mean, sure, I'll lose everything, but then... I'll have nothing to lose. First, I'll take out the nerve centers--White House, Pentagon--then any domestic defense capabilities, and then critical infrastructure--like cellular, Internet, that kind of thing--and then, well, I think then, I'll just wipe New York off the f***ing map. For fun! I'll even throw in Des Moines, and that little cousin-f***er hick town that Maeve's from, 'cause why not? See, Starlight, I'd prefer to be loved. I would, but if you take that away from me, well, being feared is A-one okey-doke by me. So, go ahead, partner. Do it. No? You don't want to do it? Well, then, I would have to say that you have absolutely no f***ing leverage, because I am The Homelander, and I really can do whatever the f**k I want.\"\n\nRelated\n\nThe 10 Biggest Villains On The Boys, Ranked\n\nNot all superheroes wear capes but some villains do, as evidenced by some of the biggest villains on The Boys.\n\nHomelander isn't just physically powerful. He's intelligent, charming, and puts on an incredible public persona that has most of the world believing he's a wholesome superhero. His ability to manipulate the world makes him even more dangerous because no one can rely on Homelander being stupid or desperate as a way to keep him in check. As Homelander gets away with more and more evildoing behind the scenes, he comes to realize that there truly is nothing that anyone can do to stop him. The more he gets away with it, the more he's willing to do without batting an eye. He doesn't even blink at executing someone in cold blood anymore, because he knows he can do it without repercussions. As proven by the quote, he already has a plan in place if the public does turn on him. Nobody can stop him, not even other Supes, so he has the power to take over everything. In just a few swift moves, he could cause a total collapse of human society.\n\nThe most dangerous thing about Homelander, though, is that he's slowly allowing his toxic and evil behavior to bleed into his public persona. Certain groups of people, like White Supremacists, idolize his \"I refuse to be persecuted for my strength\" mentality. At the end of Season 3, Homelander introduces his son, Ryan, to a crowd of his supporters. A man wearing a \"Believe Starlight\" shirt shouts \"F*** you, fascists!\" and throws something at Homelander. He hits Ryan instead and in a fit of rage, Homelander busts the man's head open with his heat vision. Instead of being horrified or scared of the extreme act of violence, the crowd begins to cheer. Ordinary humans validate this sort of behavior, making it more acceptable for Homelander to act like this in public. In exchange, Homelander is also giving the most dangerous groups of humans a voice and more power to spread their hateful ideals.\n\nThe Boys' Most Powerful Supe Is Also Its Most Dangerous Villain\n\nIn a world where supers exist, it's not hard to believe that not every person with superpowers will be a good person. The Boys pushes that idea to its limits by making almost all the major antagonists Supes or Supe supporters. The universe revolves around the unfair and unsafe imbalance between humanity and the small percentage of Supes who were given Compound V as a child. It highlights everything that's wrong with most superhero media, where heroes exist to be good and protect the world with no selfish acts.\n\nThe Boys features complicated and sophisticated world-building that shines a spotlight on many dark realities of the world, from Vought's CEO to the government to the parents who injected their children with Compound V. None of the antagonists in the series measure up to the danger that Homelander poses, though. Homelander is capable of destroying the world all by himself, but he's also capable of building an army from the darkest reaches of humanity.\n\nThe

After establishing himself as the God of all meta-humans in the previous seasons (and pulverizing anyone who dared doubt or defy him, completely destroying A-Train's spirits, mind-controlling Queen Maeve, killing Black Noir by pulling his guts out. The list can go on.) our so-called \"hero\" reached a new peak of power.\n\nBut absolute power, as time has it, corrupts all. And it seems that even a seemingly invincible Superman stand-in like Homelander has his limits. It's not news that Homelander is a profoundly unhappy person. He is insecure and lonely. Beneath his tough exterior lies discontent with his current state and a growing desperation to be loved. Homelander is no longer the forever-young poster boy of Vought.\n\nThe Boys\n\nSuperhero\n\nAction\n\nSci-Fi\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019\n\nCast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash\n\nSeasons 4\n\nTowards the end of Season 3 of The Boys, we were hinted that Homelander's turmoil was beginning to bubble because of all the battles he had lost. Season 4 begins with him having an abstract sense of victory.\n\nHe seems to have it all - he has complete control over Vought Industries, he has the sole custody of Ryan and is preparing him to follow in his footsteps, he is working alongside Victoria Neuman and is unbothered by Democratic President Robert Singer's election, and he's no longer threatened by The Boys.\n\nAnd yet, nothing is going his way. Homelander is having nightmares. He is not happy with being on trial for the murder he committed, and he is feeling helpless with Starlight turning half the population against him. As if that's not enough, Homelander is facing the downside of being human - for better or worse.\n\nHow Old Is Homelander in The Boys Season 4?\n\nClose\n\nAlready going through a mental disarray and being annoyed with the fact that no one at Vought is brave enough to stand up to him, Homelander pays the new Supe, Sister Sage, a visit at her apartment. Little does he know, she is about to expose cracks in his carefully crafted image.\n\nSister Sage's first impression on the viewers is that she is elegant and blunt. She wastes no time pointing out that Homelander's stylist is dyeing his hair more often, which suggests he is graying, and that his prostate is swelling, connecting it all to Homelander's encounter with Soldier Boy and saying,\n\n\"You've got a lot of power, but you do age.\"\n\nSpeaking of which, in the series adaptation of The Boys, Homelander is shown to have been born in 1981, which means he is slightly older than 40 years old in Season 4. The idea that he was beginning to age, albeit slowly, was laughable. Yet somehow, the realization sunk deeper under his skin, planting an itch and making him scrutinize himself even more than usual.\n\nConsidering how much money and effort Vought International puts into The Seven's pristine appearances, it is easy to forget that all the members of the team are going through something or the other, with their bodies betraying them more each day. Homelander's mental state continues to spiral because of all the stress he is facing, and the question is, how far would he go before becoming obsolete?\n\nWhy Is He Collecting His Gray Hair?\n\nClose\n\nIf Homelander's aging comes as a shock to you, a bigger revelation is the fact that he's collecting singular strands in a glass jar, tucked safely along with his most prized possessions. These mementos from his glory days include a picture of Stormfront and a milk bottle. Clearly, they remind him of the bittersweet moments that symbolize all that he's lost.\n\nConfronting his mortality has sent Homelander in a limbo - he is at the peak of his popularity but he also needs to consider maneuvering things to avoid transforming into a lifeless, hollow shell of nothing. He admits the same to Sister Sage, who is quick to realize that Homelander's graying hair isn't just a cosmetic issue; it is a reflection of his internal struggle. Of his dissatisfaction. Of the power dynamics enveloping Vought. And the weight of responsibility as leader of The Seven.\n\nDuring a recent confrontation with Hughie, who climbs up into a vent above the room Homelander, Victoria, and Sister Sage are having a conversation in, we see the full extent of Homelander's aging reflexes and his dark, desperate acts. Normally, he would easily flick a human away without thinking. But for the first time, his instincts and his aim fails him, which is a frustrating reminder that God or not, Homelander is not immune to life's cruelest trick.\n\nEric Kripke and Homelander's Mounting Existential Angst\n\nClose\n\nWhen Sister Sage accuses Homelander of having an \"existential mid-life crisis\" of sorts, it puts a lot into perspective. Season 4 of The Boys is clearly more than just surface politics and unchecked violence. It portrays the main antagonist as a man who simply cannot find happiness of any sort. In a recent conversation with Eric Kripke, IGN found out that the showrunner intended to send Homelander in the throes of a full-blown midlife crisis.\n\nTo quote Kripke:\n\n\"Every season we try to dig a little deeper into every character, and Homelander is no exception. There's one thing he's been wanting for three seasons now. What would happen when we give it to him? The answer is, he'd be miserable... Spoiler alert, anything he gets isn't going to make him happy or anything he thinks he wants isn't going to make him happy because he's a deep, gaping black hole of neediness and insecurity.\"\n\nAnthony Starr's character has had one too many vulnerable moments on the show where he unloads his turbulent thoughts. Whether he's at a final breaking point, speaking to three versions of hum staring back at him in a mirror or speaking to his own portrait inside Vought Tower, the taunts and sympathy burrowed into his brain manage to surface. This is because Kripke wants the audience to understand Homelander.\n\nHe mentions in the same interview, \"I don't want them to sympathize with Homelander - he's a psychotic - but at least I want them to understand what is making him do the things that he does.\"\n\nTowards the end of the third episode of Season 4 of The Boys, Homelander is seen entering a red door that leads to where it all began - home. So strap in, because in the coming episode, we will be witnessing another twisted villain origin story.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors":

He has almost all of the powers of Superman and none of the heart or conscience that makes the Man of Steel a real hero. Instead, Homelander is a psychopath in a cape who is rapidly losing the desire to pretend to be heroic. Now, a previously deleted scene from The Boys Season 1 is shedding some light on how he turned out this way.\n\nPrime Video debuted a scene that was cut from The Boys' first season that features Homeland's childhood as the key experiment at Vought International. It's clear that Vought is trying to mold the young Homelander into their ideal version of a patriotic superhero. But it goes horribly wrong.\n\nHomelander understandably has some questions about who he is and where he came from. In the middle of his indoctrination, Homelander asks if Vought scientist Jonah Vogelbaum is his father. When his female tutor confirms this, Homelander inquires if she is his mother. And her affirmation leads to a fatal mistake. The horrifying aspect of this isn't just the death of the woman, it's the way that Vought has covered up Homelander's murders prior to this one. As a child, Homelander still had some fear about the consequences of his actions. As an adult, he has none.\n\nWithout sharing too many spoilers for this week's episode of The Boys, more info about Homelander is revealed.

Annie completely loses it after Firecracker takes her Starlight bashing antics a step too far. Hughie and Kimiko go on a wild mission while he tries to save his father's life. And poor Frenchie finally has to admit to Colin that he killed his parents. But Homelander absolutely dominates this episode with a trip back to his place of birth as he \"confronts\" his past in the only way he knows how to anything: with unhinged violence.\n\nAt the end of episode three, the many voices existing in Homelander's head agree that he must confront his past. So, this episode starts with Homelander arriving back at the lab where he was born and raised as a child. The workers there seem both surprised and scared to see him for obvious reasons. He singles out a couple of old faces he remembers, specifically Marty and Frank. Marty even refers to him as John before he quickly tells him to use Homelander instead.\n\nHomelander comes with a fudge whale cake and tells everyone to eat some of the cake. He also asks for a woman named Barbara, who is off-site at the moment, and instructs them that she needs to come back for the reunion. His sinister smile and narrowed eyes indicate that he's not just there to have a homecoming party.\n\nHomelander invites Frank over for a game of wastepaper basketball (which most of us just call \"trashketball\"), saying the best out of three will win. He reminds Frank that he taught him about that game because he watched Frank play it while he was in a nearby oven. Frank was the person who ran tests on kid Homelander, turning up the temperature to see if it would burn his skin. It's a small glimpse into Homelander's inhumane treatment that certainly contributes to why he is such an awful supe.\n\nIt begins to dawn on Frank and the others that this visit will spiral into violence. Frank says that he was just doing his job and, well, Homelander responds by making Frank get in the oven. Frank apologizes to Homelander but he's not trying to hear it. Homelander turns the oven up high and cooks Frank to melted bits in front of everyone. Yikes.\n\nLater on, Homelander looks at marks on the wall of his growth and we discover that he got his Homelander moniker at 16 years old. He calls Marty over and says that he is sorry for what he did to Frank. (A lie, obviously.) Homelander says Marty was one of the kinder ones, but notes that Marty used to call him Squirt. He tells the story about why Marty gave him that name. Homelander said he would be left in an isolation room for hours while Marty and cameras watched him. As he got into puberty, Homelander would masturbate at night between Marty's nightly rounds to feel something good. This explains why Homelander is always getting someone to satisfy him in that way now, if he's not doing it himself.\n\nMarty caught him doing it one night and laughed at him, calling him Squirt. Homelander decides to get revenge by making Marty masturbate in front of the entire room of people. Marty is having a hard time, uh, getting hard, and Homelander says he will do it or lose his penis to laser eyes. Marty can't do it and Homelander lasers right at his crotch. He later steps on his head and crushes it.\n\nAt this point, Barbara shows up and, unlike most others, she talks to Homelander without fear. He takes her into a room that he called \"the bad room.\" She calls him out for his behavior and says they were just people following Dr. Vogelbaum and Stan Edgar's orders. He refutes this by saying he was a child and someone should have stood up for him. For the first time, Homelander has a point. Barbara says the day he was born he lasered out of his mom's stomach, killing her and three others that same day. She notes that he could have broken out of there at any time, but his need for approval and love and to not disappoint them took over.\n\nShe says they brought in psychologists and helped to engineer and instill that in him so he'd be obedient. And, until this point, it has mostly kept him in check. But that's over now, it seems. We last see Barbara in that room looking horrified at the remains of her co-worker's dismembered bodies strewn everywhere. Homelander gets into an elevator with blood all over his face to do god knows what next.\n\nBetween this and a season one vault video posted by The Boys social media team (seen above), there's a chance that we could get a Homelander prequel series. We know that The Boys is ending in season five and that there are other planned spinoffs on the way. And there's certainly a lot of diabolical things to explore with the creation and eventual rise of the show's greatest villain. Until then, we will see how Homelander's return to his birth place will affect his future.", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fudge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squirt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crotch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dismemberment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vault (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Animals_and_Evolution", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Animals and Evolution", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/04061749/The-Boys-season-four-trailer-bloody-Homelander-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Homelander's childhood in Vought's labs involved traumatic tests and mental abuse, shaping him into a potential monster. While Homelander may not have been fated to be evil, his upbringing solidified him into someone willing to commit horrific acts.\n\nThe Boys has been steadily revealing more about the secret history of Homelander, exploring the possibility whether the villain was destined to be evil all along. Played by Anthony Starr, Homelander is the leader of the Seven and the most powerful Supe within the world of The Boys. He's also a narcissistic, cruel, and petty powerhouse who has proven very willing to kill those he deems annoyances, let alone threats. Across four seasons of the series (as well as his appearances in spin-offs like Gen V and The Boys: Diabolical), Homelander has proven to be The Boys' most terrifying character.\n\nHowever, there's a solid question whether or not he was always fated to that kind of role. The Boys has explored several themes, including questions about the corrupting influence of power and the importance of nurture over nature. Given his isolated and abused origins, The Boys has been quietly exploring whether Homelander could have ever been anything different than the monster he's become. Season 4's \"Wisdom of the Ages\" casts a new light on the abuse during Homelander's origins with Vought, which led directly to the monster he's become. This raises a huge question about whether Homelander was always evil.\n\nRelated Every Member Of The Boys Shares The Exact Same Story Theme In Season 4\n\nThe Boys season 4 sees all of its main characters struggling individually, but the team's subplots have more in common than it first seems.\n\nHomelander Was Created By Vought To Be The Perfect Hero Vought's Attempts To Replace Soldier Boy Created Homelander\n\nThe origins of Homelander have been steadily revealed across the course of The Boys, highlighting Vought's attempts to create the perfect hero and the unforeseen consequences of their actions. The company behind Compound V has been creating Supes for decades, with one of the first being Soldier Boy. Although Soldier Boy was a success for the company and publicly celebrated as a hero, Vought eventually decided to create a more malleable successor. After convincing Soldier Boy to donate a sperm sample, Vought worked with his resentful Payback teammates to remove him from the equation, allowing Soviet agents to capture him.\n\nSoldier Boy's sperm sample was used to artificially impregnate an unknown woman, who gave birth to the future Homelander. Named John, the baby was already believed to be potentially stronger than his father, having ripped his way out of his mother as a newborn. Vought's efforts to create a perfect hero highlights their willingness to cross huge moral lines for the sake of profit, and their apparent decision to raise John differently than Soldier Boy sought to mold him into Vought's ultimate marketing tool. However, their efforts only ended up creating a far worse Supe than Soldier Boy ever was.\n\nHomelander's Brutal Upbringing & Childhood Explained\n\nHomelander's upbringing in Vought's labs has been steadily revealed to have been traumatic for John. Although he was apparently a sweet child at first, the company's desire to turn him into the strongest Supe ever resulted in severel cruel and brutal tests, forcing him to fight other Supes to train his combat skills. Homelander goes back to the lab in season 4, with \"Wisdom of the Ages,\" revealing how scientists would put him in an incinerator to test his endurance. His \"training\" went beyond physical anguish, however, as he also suffered plenty of mental trauma over the years as well.\n\nJohn was conditioned to be the ultimate American hero, spending hours in front of projections of \"patriotic\" imagery that warped his perception of the world and himself. \"Wisdom of the Ages\" reveals lab technicians mocked him and ignored his pleas for help, turning their fear of the powerful boy into abuse. This transformed the sweet child into a potential monster. Jonah Vogelbaum apologized to Homelander in season 1's \"The Self-Preservation Society,\" saying that John deserved to be raised by a loving family instead of growing up in a horrifying lab. However, it was too late and the damage was done.\n\nRelated The Boys Season 4 Flips Starlight's Most Controversial Scene From Season 1\n\nThe Boys season 4 features a new scene that is especially dark, with it flipping the dynamic of Starlight's controversial season 1 scene.\n\nWhen \"John\" First Became \"The Homelander\" The Boys: Diabolical Revealed The Exact Moment John Truly Embraced Being Homelander\n\nAlthough John began to think of himself as Homelander sometime while still in the Vought labs (as evidenced by his scratching out of the name John on a wall), it seems that on some level, there was still some hope for the young man. However, the events of \"One Plus One Equals Two\" from The Boys: Diabolical confirmed how Homelander truly became the monster he is today. Confirmed by The Boys Executive Producer Eric Kripke to be canon within the universe of The Boys, the episode focuses on Homelander's first mission as a superhero and public debut with the Seven.\n\nDespite the lingering trauma of his upbringing and being forced to lie to the public, Homelander seemed to genuinely believe he could be a hero. However, his first mission to peacefully disarm a group of eco-terrorists quickly went sideways, with Homelander failing to restrain himself properly. The result was several deaths and the destruction of the lab, which Black Noir helped to cover up and brushed aside. This helped cement Homelander's world-view, dismissing humanity as playthings that ultimately didn't matter. While he may have already been on the path towards villainy, Homelander's first mission completed his transformation into a monster.\n\nWas Homelander Always Evil In The Boys? It's Complicated Nature Vs. Nurture Is At The Heart Of The Boys Close\n\nOne of the big thematic questions of The Boys is about the nature of evil and how it comes to be. Characters like Ryan have struggled with their potential for both good and evil, with the deciding factor seemingly the way he's raised and the influences that impact him. Soldier Boy was emotionally abused by a dismissive father, setting him on the path to become a \"hero\" to prove him wrong. Likewise, the lack of love and the litany of abuses forced on John as he grew up curdled within the boy and helped transform him into the murderous Homelander.\n\nMaybe there's a chance Homelander didn't have to be evil in the long-run. With the right care, he may have genuinely been able to be a hero. However, none of that excuses what Homelander's become and what he's done since. John may not have always been fated to be evil, but his upbringing helped solidify him into someone who'd happily murder a mother in front of her child or leave hundreds of innocent civilians to die. It plays into The Boys overarching exploration of nature versus nurture, and highlights how evil is something we can create in others and ourselves.\n\nThe Boys Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.

Leaving Barbara alive suggests Homelander seeks her approval and respects her more than the other Vought scientists at the lab. Barbara's punishment is still cruel, as she must watch her colleagues die at the hands of Homelander.\n\nHomelander is more volatile than ever in The Boys season 4, and episode 4 finds him returning to the Vought lab where he was created -- and killing everyone except for one person: Barbara. The ending of The Boys season 4, episode 3 sees Homelander deciding to return to his place of origin, as he wants to get rid of his humanity. He associates his traumatic upbringing with his need for approval and love, and so, he visits the place responsible for his troublesome childhood.\n\nMany of the scientists who \"raised\" Homelander are still working at the lab, and he makes sure to pay them back for the pain they caused him as a child. His methods of torturing them are gruesome, and they seek to show the scientists exactly what they put Homelander through. Of course, they're far less capable of surviving the experiments and circumstances the Supe did. And by the time Homelander is finished there, all but one of them is dead. Viewers may be wondering why Homelander leaves Barbara alive in The Boys season 4, but her interactions with him make it obvious.\n\nRelated Why Hughie's Mom Pulls THAT Compound-V Stunt In The Boys Season 4, Episode 4\n\nHughie's mom makes a questionable decision involving Compound V in The Boys season 4, and it will leave viewers wondering about her motives.\n\nNot Killing Barbara Proves Homelander Still Seeks Her Approval The Supe Respects Her More Than The Other Vought Scientists\n\nHomelander may be hoping to eliminate his need for approval in The Boys season 4, episode 4, but leaving Barbara alive suggests that he's still seeking hers. It's obvious Barbara is one of the higher-ranking employees at the Vought lab, and the fact that Homelander listens to her suggests that he respects her more than her colleagues. She also doesn't fear him like the others do, and Homelander is looking for people who can challenge him in The Boys season 4. It's why he seeks out Sister Sage, and it's why he seems to appreciate Barbara more than Vought's other scientists.\n\nIt's obvious Barbara is one of the higher-ranking employees at the Vought lab, and the fact that Homelander listens to her suggests that he respects her more than her colleagues.\n\nAlthough his appreciation doesn't extend to actual affection, it's not surprising that Homelander leaves Barbara alive in \"Wisdom of the Ages.\" The Supe is trying to cut all ties to his humanity, but this likely isn't something he'll be able to do -- and his treatment of Barbara proves it. Killing the other scientists is a step in a darker direction, but Homelander still hasn't completely lost his need for love and praise. It's what drives his character, and it's hard to say if he'll ever rid himself of that motivation.\n\nBarbara's Punishment Is Watching Her Colleagues All Die Homelander Doesn't Completely Forgive Barbara\n\nAlthough Homelander spares Barbara's life in The Boys season 4, episode 4, he doesn't completely forgive her transgressions. In fact, her punishment is arguably crueler than those of her colleagues. While Barbara doesn't experience physical suffering at the hands of Homelander, the Supe still punishes her. Barbara's punishment is watching Vought's other scientists die, something that will stick with her forever. Barbara will no doubt feel guilt for being unable to stop it, and she'll suffer much longer than the scientists who die in The Boys season 4 because of this.\n\nThe Boys ActionDramaCrime Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.

We know that Eric Kripke plans to continue Gen V for a few more seasons and create other The Boys spinoffs, too. And we are getting some very, very strong hints that The Boys' main villain, Homelander, could be getting a prequel series. Is this a good idea? I think so, if it is approached the right way.\n\nIn episode four of season four, Homelander spends time confronting some of his deepest and earliest core wounds. He goes back to the Vought lab where he was born and raised for a \"family reunion\" of sorts. He confronts a couple of people who mistreated him as a child. Of course, Homelander gets bloody revenge on pretty much everyone, setting the stage for him to become even more unhinged. This small peek into Homelander's origin story gives us a lot of context to some of his frankly disturbing proclivities. A prequel Homelander series would further establish how he became such a twisted being.\n\nI am not super interested in seeing a very young Homelander get tortured by adults. That just seems overly brutal, even for this universe's standards. But I think the period from where he becomes \"The Homelander\" at age 16 through him becoming the leader of the Seven is an intriguing part of his life that we know little about. After spending years with lots of isolation and brainwashing, how did he learn to navigate larger society and become the hero of America? What challenges did he face? His journey from socially awkward supe loner to the cunning leader we all know would be fun to witness. It would largely hinge on finding the right young man to compliment Antony Starr's flawless portrayal of an adult Homelander.\n\nI am not always a fan of trying to humanize a villain. But the duality of having the powers of a god yet the innate human need for love, family, and approval, even after excruciating torture, makes Homelander such an effective antagonist. Sure, we could get flashbacks to his young child and pre-teen days, like what The Boys posted on social media with the hashtag #HomeSweetHome. (Is that a title hint? I'd like for it to be Home Sweet Home(lander) personally.)\n\nBut that shouldn't be the primary focus of a Homelander prequel spinoff series. By aiming at his late teen and early 20s, we'd get a chance to meet other members of the OG Seven, like Queen Maeve, at a more impressionable point of their lives, too. Maybe we can discover what happened to Mister Marathon, whom A-Train replaced prior to the events of The Boys. In fact, The Boys could even make it a true \"Dawn of the Seven\" story about how they all came together but with a larger focus on Homelander's story.\n\nRight now, we don't know if Homelander will survive the events of The Boys or not. (My guess is he's going to stick around.) But, if he does, it wouldn't be out of the realm for him to appear on other spinoffs. A prequel series would be an excellent way to have a complete picture of Homelander as he moves forward. In fact, it could even connect to what we get in The Boys: Mexico or future Gen V seasons.

Barbara first made her appearance in a cameo role in Episode 3 in a quick flashback vision, haunting Homelander, implying she was someone crucial from his past. She then made a full appearance in the subsequent episode when Homelander visited the lab he was created in to learn more about his past.\n\nSo what became of Barbara in The Boys Season 4 Episode 4? Did she die? Here's all that you need to know.\n\nWhat happens to Nancy Lenehan's Barbara in Season 4 Episode 4?\n\nIt is unclear what happens to Nancy Lenehan's Barbara. She is last seen being intimidated by Homelander and fans do not get to see what happens after that.\n\nHomelander lasers Marty's pelvic area leaving him to bleed out in revenge. This is because Marty humiliated Homelander by giving him the derogatory nickname \"Squirt.\" Barbara comes in and tries to stop Homelander. Homelander then kills Marty and invites Barbara to join him for a private conversation in \"The Bad Room.\"\n\nBarbara tries to defend the actions of her colleagues towards Homelander when he was younger, claiming they were scared. Barbara's tone then changes into something sinister as she gleefully reveals that everyone has been terrified of Homelander since his birth.\n\nShe then adds that Vought knew Homelander was physically stronger than all of them.

It gender-swapped Stormfront to have her engage in a messed-up relationship with Homelander, and it even let Maeve live and have a happy-ish ending. But arguably the biggest change so far has been that made to Homelander. In the comics, the character was born in a secret laboratory and raised chained down to a hydrogen bomb. Despite being very much the psychopath we know and love to hate, a late big twist revealed that the Homelander of the comics was kind of gaslit into committing atrocities based on false information. Before that, he was genuinely a noble superhero.\n\nThat's not Antony Starr's portrayal of Homelander, however. In the TV version of \"The Boys,\" Homelander is a victim of the worst kind of parenting while still being a monster himself. We've spent four seasons exploring his vulnerability and his need for love, despite him being a sociopath since childhood. As series creator Eric Kripke once said of Homelander:\n\n\"Even though he's a sociopath, he's also a human being who has reactions and feelings. To me, the biggest sin that Homelander commits is that he hates that he has feelings and he hates that he's a human being. If he embraced that part of him more, he might be a happier person who isn't going to destroy the planet.\"\n\nExcept, as we learn in \"The Boys\" season 4, Homelander's huge craving for approval was part of his conditioning since childhood. It was Vought International's attempt at making him docile and make sure he would not betray its executives. Homelander may be the ultimate antagonist for the show's main characters, but it is mere humans that are the series' biggest villains.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormfront (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermonuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Reviews", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-boys-season-4-gives-us-a-villain-thats-somehow-worse-than-homelander/l-intro-1718030951.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It's common knowledge that Homelander didn't have a freshly-baked-cookies kind of childhood and was raised under observation, emotionally manipulated and controlled by his captors, two of whom were still working at the Vought lab when he spontaneously popped in for a reunion.\n\n\"Where's Barbara [the Director]?\" he asks his old minders Frank and Marty, \"Bring her in, I'd love to catch up.\"\n\nFans of the show will have already spotted the insincerity in his chipper tone, the threat behind the cheer. One could literally foresee the blood and guts on the wall. What one could not anticipate, however, was the feeling of something close to empathy on the horizon.\n\nThings unfold in the typical Homelander way - mind games and savagery.\n\nDuring his first round of 'Let's toy with the humans', Homelander is playing waste-paper basketball with Frank when he recalls the memory of being burned alive.\n\nNaturally, being the most powerful Supe (yet to be properly challenged by daddy Soldier Boy), Homelander wasn't incinerated. His flesh didn't melt away but he felt every ounce of pain in excruciating measure. Meanwhile, Frank fist-pumped in celebration at sinking a balled-up piece of paper in the bin while Homelander's tears \"sizzled away\" in the bone-melting heat.\n\nIt was the first wobble in our resolve to feel nothing but hatred and disgust for the depraved Supe. It also turned out to be a much more effective way of getting us to engage with him than the flashback of him as a toddler, alone and isolated.\n\nThough we were aware of the link between the innocent tiny tot and the polished psychopath he grew up to be, there wasn't enough detail to ground that experience, so we did little more than shrug at the yesteryear version of him.\n\nThis time around, The Boys gives us something much more tangible to chew on.\n\nIt's easy to imagine the vulnerable child he once was being brutalised by the adults in control. The show draws out that moment even longer but the painful memory that gave him nightmares is one Frank couldn't even recall - an insignificant footnote in the life of a man who was 'just doing his job'.\n\nConsequently, by the time Homelander takes his revenge on Frank and throws him in the man-sized oven to burn, you're not too perturbed.\n\nAnother pang of pity bubbles up when Homelander turns his wrath on Marty, helping him to remember the origins of the nickname Marty gave him.\n\nSquirt, as it were, was born out of the moment in which Marty caught a young Homelander masturbating. He'd laughed then and awarded Homelander the derogatory name.\n\nOn its own it's not much, but when Homelander reveals that this 'daily activity' was carried out during the only couple of minutes where he was not under the scrutinising gaze of his tormentors, it builds a picture. It echoes the rawness of his pain when he shares that it was the only time in the day that he felt anything good.\n\nIt's sad and pitiable, made even sadder by the embarrassment this already defenceless child had to endure when he was mocked.\n\nFor a minute, it's hard not to disassociate your mind from Homelander the brute and instead to visualise John, the vulnerable. Until he forces Marty to publicly masturbate, laughing at his attempts to 'shuck the little mushroom,' as Homelander put it.\n\nHis open-mouth cackle as a panicked Marty spits into his hand attempting to move the process along was the kind of soulless, Homelander energy we're used to. Sadly, Marty is unable to fulfil Homelander's brief and so the maniac lasers a hole through his penis for being unable to get it up, thus reminding us how truly awful he really is. Just like that, all is temporarily restored. We hate him again.\n\nHowever, The Boys isn't quite finished letting us stew in this uneasy mix of sympathy and repugnance, so they pull the ace out of the hole. Barbara.\n\nAfter bursting Marty's head like a grape underneath his boot, Homelander enters into a to-and-fro with the Director, who shows absolutely zero sympathy for her past actions.\n\nIn fact, she belittles him and momentarily reduces him to the child he was with just words before praising the old teams' success in curating a desperate need for love within him, in order to control him.\n\n\"We have no physical power over you, we never did,\" she reveals. \"You could have broken out of here any time you wanted, we couldn't have stopped you, but you didn't because you couldn't stand the idea that we would be disappointed in you.\"\n\nIt's an oof moment that keeps sucker-punching him.\n\n\"Your need for approval and for love - Vought brought in the best psychologists in the world. They developed the protocol that carefully engineered that need so that you would be obedient. In many ways that was our greatest success.\"\n\nOf course she paid for her self-congratulatory brand of honesty with Homelander locking her in a room with the rest of the secret lab employees' freshly-murdered corpses strewn around the place, blood streaked across the walls.\n\nBarbara revealed herself to be callous and unfeeling, and through hers and Vought's actions it, for the first time, becomes crystal clear how their moulding of Homelander shaped him into the unhinged villain he's become.\n\nNone of this has anything to do with the new crop of employees whose insides now decorate the walls, as once again we are snapped back into reality.\n\nFor a moment, we witnessed his pure, innocent vulnerability and we applaud a show that can add dimension to even the most repellent characters.\n\nThat said, Homelander may be damaged but he's still a self-aware, vile Supe who makes no attempt to change for the better and thus remains irredeemable.", "source": {"uri": "digitalspy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Spy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supe_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Octopus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Boy_(The_Shirelles_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Boy (The Shirelles song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nightmare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flying ace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molding_(process)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molding (process)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-boys-season-4-656b6ff1213dd.jpg?crop=0.822xw:1.00xh;0.0897xw,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

(Image credit: Amazon MGM Studios)\n\nFull spoilers follow for The Boys season four episodes three and four.\n\nThe Boys season four episode four is out now on Prime Video - and, thanks to some \"very disturbing\" scenes involving everyone's favorite big bad Homelander (Antony Starr), viewers are praising it as the season's \"best episode\" so far.\n\nAfter getting off to an inauspicious start with its three-episode premiere last Thursday (June 13), The Boys' newest season has come out swinging with its latest chapter. Titled 'Wisdom of the Ages', it's easily one of the hit Amazon show's darkest episodes ever, with the series' various characters grappling with their trauma-laced histories and having to make soul-crushing decisions.\n\nIt's the scenes involving Homelander, however, that are dominating online discussions in the wake of episode four's release. Indeed, fans have had plenty to say about what they've just witnessed - and, thankfully, all of it is universally positive.\n\nThis is your final warning: major spoilers follow for The Boys season four episode four. Turn back now if you're not caught up.\n\n'Wisdom of the Ages' sees Homelander return to his roots, aka the laboratory home (read: prison) where he was raised (read: experimented on). We already knew he was going back to face his past, too, with season four episode three's ending revealing that The Boys' most powerful Supe needed to \"go back to the start\" and face his fears in order to move forward with his plans for world domination.\n\nFans of one of the best Prime Video shows around, though, were well aware that this wasn't going to be a happy family reunion. Sure, Homelander lulls the lab's scientists into a false sense of security with the chocolate fudge whale cake he brings as a gift, as well as seemingly chipper demeanour. But, what starts out as an apparently light-hearted visit from Homelander descends into a gruesome and diabolical quest for retribution as The Seven's autocratic leader murders every lab staff member. Well, everyone except the lab's former chief scientist Barbara, who he leaves - traumatized, may I add - trapped in a cell, surrounded by the mutilated corpses of her fellow boffins.\n\nHarrowing as that scene is, the episode's most grisly and shocking deaths are reserved for two particular characters who inflicted physical and emotional/mental harm on Homelander as a kid.\n\nFrank, who tested Homelander's - known as John as a child - resistance to fire/heat in a giant furnace, is cooked alive in said incinerator by Homelander. Later, Marty, who cruelly gave John the nickname 'Squirt' when he caught him masturbating one day, loses his own manhood when Homelander uses his lazer eyes ability to blast a hole through Marty's nether regions. Homelander also stomps on Marty's head to put the dying scientist out of his misery when Barbara chastizes Homelander for leaving Marty to bleed to death.\n\nUnderstandably, the brutality of these scenes, plus Starr's outstanding performance - one that's equal parts unhinged, evil, and sympathy-inducing - has seen fans flock to discussion boards and X/Twitter to voice their opinions about season four's most impactful episode yet. On ResetEra, user JEH wrote \"what an episode\", before adding: \"[It's] really refreshing to get scary Homelander again and have the violence be more personal and not played for laughs\".\n\nMany agreed with JEH's sentiments on Reddit, too. ICrashedStockMarket said 'Wisdom of the Ages' was \"one of the few episodes where I was genuinely terrified of Homelander\", while CartoonAcademic opined \"every scene with Homelander... is some of the most tense TV I've ever seen.\"\n\nZealousIdealTable1 was similarly effusive in their praise, saying it \"might be one of the most unhinged episodes of television history\", before adding \"Homelander is literally scaring viewers with every minute\". Iwillragequit99 perhaps summed it up best, though, writing: \"Every time the episode cut back to any time in the laboratory my stomach would just drop and I would feel sick. What a crazy episode.\"\n\nComment from r/TheBoys\n\nEpisode four's lab-based scenes wouldn't have carried the same weight if Starr's electrifying display hadn't anchored them, mind you. It'll come as no surprise to learn, then, that viewers are gushing over the actor's performance.\n\nRedditor QuantavioustheWise said \"Starr better receive some awards for his role this season\", while pikameta added: \"Starr is f*****g killing it this episode. the immediate switch in his demanor is top notch acting\". Il Il agreed, writing \"if Antony Starr doesn't get an Emmy then something is definitely rigged\", before WillyTrillEra chimed in with a similar opinion, saying: \"Antony Starr deserves an Emmy for this episode. He is TERRIFYING.\"\n\nIn my review of The Boys season four's first three episodes, I expressed my concern that the wildly popular Prime Video series might be starting to lose its superpowered edge. I also wrote, though, that \"maybe season four's remaining episodes will prove me wrong and show that The Boys is still the jewel in Amazon's TV show crown\". Based on episode four's jaw-dropping, Homelander-starring moments, I think it might just do that.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\n\"That's what I'm really interested in with the character, is going into the deeper, dark places and the vulnerabilities,\" Starr added.\n\nHomelander's homecoming has been long coming.\n\nPast seasons of \"The Boys\" have alluded to the psychological damage that resulted from Homelander, whose real name is John, being raised by scientists in a lab. In the spring of 1981, Vought scientist Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum grew him in a test tube using Soldier Boy's (Jensen Ackles) DNA.\n\nInstead of growing up with a family in a home, he was isolated, deprived of a childhood, and ruthlessly trained to become the world's greatest, seemingly unbeatable supe. As a result, Homelander became a maniacal and vindictive supe with a desperate need for love and approval.\n\nIn season three, Homelander's insecurities are called out during an interaction with Soldier Boy, who scoffs at him for being weak and starving for attention.\n\nSeason four of \"The Boys\" shows Homelander grappling with his rapid aging and worrying about the legacy he'll leave behind for his son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti).\n\nDespite his best efforts, Homelander still falls short as a father. He arrives at the conclusion that his need for love is a weakness that's holding him back from becoming his true, most powerful self. So, he decides to confront his past during episode four and return to the Vought lab that raised him.\n\nThe reunion is far from amicable and civilized. Although Homelander enters the room with an uncharacteristically friendly demeanor, he becomes progressively more menacing as he reveals how deep his grudge against the Vought scientists goes.\n\nHomelander vividly recalls the different ways the scientists experimented on him, harming him physically and emotionally. In retaliation, he burns one scientist to death in an oven.\n\nHomelander also recalls another scientist, Marty, catching him masturbating in his cell as a child and giving him the nickname \"Squirt.\" As payback, Homelander humiliates Marty by ordering him to masturbate in front of him and the other scientists. Then, he lasers Marty's penis off using his superpowers, laughs in delight, and crushes him to death.\n\nShowrunner Eric Kripke told BI that Homelander's reactions throughout the lab scenes were the result of Starr putting his own spin on the character.\n\n\"In the draft of the script, he was written to be pretty cruel, top to bottom,\" Kripke said. \"He came in wanting revenge on the people who did this horrible thing to him. And Ant called me and he's like, 'I think the approach is wrong. I think he needs to come in childlike at times, not totally sure how he's feeling, and experiencing it in real time and just walking through it.'\"\n\nKripke said that Homelander's reunion with the scientists is \"horrifying\" and unsettling because of the supe's mercurial nature.\n\n\"It's so unpredictable because there's moments where he's just like, 'Oh wow, this is my childhood home.' And then he'll suddenly snap into feeling vengeful,\" Kripke said. \"And it's a beautiful, beautiful performance. And we did not write to it. It was Ant coming to us and discussing it.\"\n\nLater in the episode, Homelander learns from another scientist, Barbara, that his need for approval and love was specifically engineered to make him obedient. She says he'll never be able to overcome that human need because it's ingrained in him, but he thinks otherwise.\n\nThe episode concludes with Homelander grinning and covered in blood after murdering the other scientists and leaving Barbara trapped in his old cell with the bloody bodies.\n\n\"It's his little therapy session, and he thinks he's nailed it,\" Starr said. \"That's the funny thing, is that he's coming out covered in blood and guts and going, 'I'm going to be a good dad.' That was reaching, but he's trying to do the right thing -- ultimately for the most selfish of reasons, for his legacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_singh@businessinsider.com", "name": "Olivia Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Boy_(The_Shirelles_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Boy (The Shirelles song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(propaganda)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin (propaganda)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Isles"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/667432b82efa138e033117ee?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Not just the physical strength and near-invulnerability of Vought's heroes, but how the corporation controlled these demigods via financial strings, political ties, and psychological manipulation. They held the Supes' reins for decades before their overconfidence and greed spawned Homelander, whose physical power is offset by his megalomania and brittle psyche. Madelyn Stillwell used a creepy combination of sex and maternal affection to restrain Homelander's worst impulses. His thirst for public adoration meant Stan Edgar could keep him on a leash as long as the status quo remained. Enter Billy Butcher and the Boys. They throw a spanner in the works of Edgar's carefully maintained machine, and suddenly, the power dynamics change. Stillwell is dead, Edgar is in prison, and Ashley Barrett is like a substitute teacher with all the responsibility and no authority. Homelander is not only free; he's in charge.\n\nSo why isn't he happy? He has his Tower, even if it's still in disrepair. He has his company, though Vought is floundering under Ashley Barrett. He's hugely popular among the right-wing, conservative, proto-fascist citizens even if the other half of the country hates him and he's on trial for a public murder. Victoria Neuman is getting closer to the Vice-Presidency and eventually the Oval Office. The Boys, now under MM's leadership, are struggling to come up with an effective countermeasure to her political ascendancy and floundering in their personal lives. And Billy Butcher, the biggest thorn in Homelander's side and the one enemy he respects, is months away from death. Despite all that, Homelander is left looking at his graying pubes and wondering what it's all for.\n\nIt's a question he brings to Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), the smartest person on the planet. The ennui of being the intellectual peak in any gathering has her steeping in a room of Taco Bell farts and reality television until Homelander offers her the opportunity to put her ideas to the test on a national scale. Homelander has a vision of a world run by Supes, where normal humans are the servants and source of endless amusement. Sage is all in, as is fellow new Seven member Firecracker (Valorie Curry). Starlight's one-time beauty pageant rival is a conspiracist, political firebrand, and sexy enough to cause many a \"hear me out\" moment. She gets off on inciting her many (male) followers to violence in the name of higher ratings and social upheaval. The men of the Seven are having a more difficult time of it despite - or perhaps because of - a brutal test of loyalty and gay chicken. The Deep's having relationship problems. A-Train is struggling with a burgeoning sense of morality. And Black Noir just can't find his motivation.\n\nMeanwhile, Frenchie's having relationship troubles that go beyond the will they/won't they dynamics he has with Kimiko, and it's threatening his sobriety. Kimiko is refusing to deal with her past trauma at the hands of the Shining Light terrorist group, and it's turning her into a hot mess. MM, who needs to eat a sandwich, has mostly reconciled with his ex, and it's her request that he find out what happened to Todd that clues them into Sage's strategy. Annie wants to leave Starlight behind, but that's difficult when you're an inspiration to millions. Hughie, finally, has his shit together. He's being supportive to the team and his girlfriend and, apart from some parental drama, seems to finally be moving past his whole... thing.\n\nButcher, unfortunately, isn't looking so hot. His brains keep leaking out his ears. There's something... wriggly... in there. And he's talking to hallucinations of his dead wife and a CIA agent named Kessler who may or may not be real. The jury's still out. But with only months to live, he's desperate to reconnect with Ryan, who, not being a complete monster, has deep misgivings about Homelander's view of normal humans like his mother. There are several budding redemption arcs happening at once, and that's good, because things aren't looking too good for society as a whole. The country is polarized right down political lines, and violence looms at every protest. Thank god it's all fiction, right?\n\nEric Kripke was never subtle about who Homelander is. Through all the violence, gore, social commentary, and humor -- and this season's already had multiple gut-buster moments -- Homelander remains the same petulant man-child he's always been. Riddled with insecurity and self-loathing, Homelander hates both himself and the terrified yes-men with whom he's surrounded himself. He despises the culture of fear he's created but can't get out of it on his own. The closest he comes to true self-awareness is when he brings on Sister Sage, but even knowing she's exponentially more intelligent than himself, he can't help but sabotage her efforts on his behalf. He's as self-destructive as ever and becoming a threat to the son he thinks he wants because their worldviews are diametrically opposed. He's not much different than James Gunn's Brandon Breyer or Rod Serling's Anthony Fremont, oddities whose emotional stunting was caused by their omnipotence. Homelander is so powerful he can't understand the ramifications of his own power, and doesn't care to.\n\nIt's why Homelander is so popular among Trumper men. Eric Kripke has spent four seasons holding a mirror up to MAGA culture and said, \"This is who you are. This is the unthinking carnage created when you lie about migrants, trans people, and pizza parlors. This is the violence committed when you're obsessed with feeling tough instead of being tough. It's what happens when you wave guns and kill randomly at the slightest provocation.\" And he's very good at it. It's not subtle, but neither is the reality Kripke skewers. The problem is that part of the audience already knows who they are. It's not that they're ignorant of the consequences. It's that their real fantasy, the real draw, is that the consequences of exercising power don't apply to them. There is no validation without conflict. Without society trying to punish them for being an outspoken bigot or shooting unarmed teenagers there's no point, because there won't be anyone leaping to their defense. They can't be shamed because there are millions of men who are just like them. It's #MeToo for belligerent morons.\n\nBut just because they're incapable of embarrassment doesn't mean we can't enjoy Kripke et al skewering the Right at every opportunity. The Boys remains as funny and squick-inducing as ever. The Supernatural reunion continues with Rob \"Chuck\" Benedict, who makes multiple appearances in a single episode, and Jim Beaver is back on our screens. Now all we need is Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins to show up and get brutally slaughtered. The first three episodes are on Prime now and well worth your time.", "source": {"uri": "pajiba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pajiba"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_parker@pajiba.com", "name":

Then Homelander set his sadistic sights on Marty, the man who gave him the nickname Squirt after he caught a teenage Homelander masturbating. As punishment, Homelander forced Marty to pleasure himself in front of the other Vought employees as Homelander unleashed unhinged laughter before eventually lasering Marty's private parts.\n\nBarbara, the woman in charge at the lab, told Homelander that he'll never be free of his need for approval and love because Vought brought in psychologists who engineered that neediness into him to make him obedient. But Homelander doesn't see himself as a mere human and he tried to prove it by killing everyone in the lab, leaving the space with a bloody, smiling expression on his face.\n\n\"I think it was a really important part of the journey and the season for the character, and overall, in the show, for the character, because I think he really believed that that was, like, a really great, cathartic, therapeutic exercise, going back there,\" Homelander's portrayer Antony Starr tells TVLine in the above video. \"It was a little messy, particularly for other people, but I think, at the end, he comes out of it really thinking he's done the right thing and done something great to move forward, and he can be a better father now for the kid.\"\n\nElsewhere in the episode, Starlight's main enemy, Firecracker, revealed on live TV that Annie had an abortion six months ago. The very public declaration spurred an angry Annie to beat up Firecracker on TV. While that violent outburst will have consequences for the blonde, her relationship with Hughie remains in a good place because he was already aware of the abortion.\n\n\"I'm so glad that I'm able to take on that subject matter,\" star Erin Moriarty (aka Annie/Starlight) says. \"And I'm so glad that I'm able to take it on in a way that portrays both perspectives on it, which is that Hughie knows that it was, unambiguously, the right thing to do, and Annie is struggling to decondition herself from her religious upbringing, and you see the struggle in her. I hope that it brings a bit more nuance to the conversation that we, quite frankly, lack.\"\n\nBelow, showrunner Eric Kripke weighs in on Homelander's \"scariest\" moment yet (which was unscripted!) and the importance of normalizing Annie's choice.\n\nTVLINE | Antony's laugh in the squirt scene is both so incredible and disturbing. Was there any direction given to him for that scene? And what was your reaction when you saw it for the first time?\n\nTo be clear, that was not scripted. In the script, he blasts the guy and then walks over to him. When Ant is playing that laugh, when I saw it in the dailies, I just was like, \"Jesus Christ, that could be the scariest I've ever seen Homelander,' and I've seen hundreds of hours of Homelander film. That to me was just such a terrifying and brilliant performance, and I would like to announce my campaign entitled Give That Guy an Emmy Already.\n\nTVLINE | How much of a turning point is that visit to the Vought lab for Homelander moving forward?\n\nI think he thinks it's a huge turning point, because he thinks that he's finally killed the parts of him that are human and has fully embraced his godhood. But he'll never be able to get rid of the parts of him that are human because he's human. And as much as he represses it and is disgusted by it and hates it and tries to kill it, he'll never quite be able to. I think that's part of his hubris and part of the tragedy of Homelander, if you can use that word, which is if only he embraced his humanity, not only would he be happier, but the world would be a much better place. But he can't, and it's just pushing him further and further into psychosis.\n\nTVLINE | Just to clarify, at the end, did he let Barbara live? Or did he leave her in that room with a timer for when it was going to burn up?\n\nShe's alive. She's in a [room] that has been welded shut. But I assume Vought people will eventually get down there and open the door. So he leaves Barbara alive so she can live on with all the trauma that Homelander feels.\n\nTVLINE | We learned that Annie had an abortion six months ago. Talk to me about the decision to have that choice take place off-screen and reveal it after the fact. And what kind of conversations did you have with Erin Moriarty about the storyline?\n\nObviously, a complicated question, and as I'm a dude, I want to handle it just right and get a lot of women to weigh in, and not necessarily women from the show, but women who have had that experience. One, Roe v. Wade was overturned while we were in the writers' room, and we were reacting to that. And two, I think the reason we wanted to play it off-camera was to make the point that, in most television shows or movies, an abortion is presented as this like earth-shattering, apocalyptic event, when in truth it's a fairly common practice that thousands and thousands and thousands of women have experienced, and them talking about it and normalizing it is frowned upon. And so, we were really interested in, obviously, it's a decision that she agonized over and found really wrenching, but she made the decision and then she continued with her life. We wanted to just make the point that it's a thing that many women have done and you don't have to play it like it's a Lifetime TV movie. It can be normal. We were just trying to normalize it for women so that they don't have to feel like they're the only one who went through it.\n\nI told Erin as soon as we knew, and she understood the reasons we were doing it and understood what it meant for the character, and also understood how something like that could really be used as ammo, this intensely personal thing being used as ammo by Firecracker. So she was all in for the challenge. She had lots of questions, and I think she handled it really responsibly and like the pro she is.\n\nTVLINE | I told Erin I thought it was really refreshing how it was like a non-starter for Annie and Hughie in that it didn't create any relationship drama for them.\n\nRight, exactly. Everything is always like the most dramatic explosion in people's lives in other media, and at least from the women I've spoken to, that just isn't the case most of the time.", "source": {"uri": "tvline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVLine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vlada_gelman@tvline.com", "name": "Vlada Gelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catharsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadomasochism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The Boys season 4 episode 4 is here and it contains Homelander's most brutal and bloodiest set of scenes the series has ever shown to date. But as shocking as the episode is, it has brought up a lot of questions about the Supe.\n\nWarning, spoilers for The Boys season 4 episode 4 follow.\n\nEpisode 4, Wisdom of the Ages, sees Homelander, with a whale-shaped chocolate cake in hand, visit the lab in which he was tested as a child and instantly make everyone feel uncomfortable. But it's about to get a whole lot worse as one by one he picks off the lab technicians and takes his revenge on them, from forcing a man into a giant oven and burning him alive as revenge for the Supe having to spend hours in the incinerator as a child, to lasering off another man's penis for making fun of him masturbating as a teen. Each kill gets bloodier until chief scientist Barbara walks in to try and calm the Supe. But instead of coming to his senses, Homelander instead locks her in the 'bad room' surrounded by the corpses of her co-workers in a The House That Jack Built-like murder vault. Yep, it's pretty gnarly.\n\nBut, although in the episode we are given a little bit of backstory to Homelander's time in the lab, the scenes may have sparked a few questions for you, such as, where does the Supe come from, how long did he spend in the lab, and why did he go back there? Well, don't worry as we are here to answer all of those questions and more.\n\nBorn sometime in 1981, Homelander, originally named John, had a far-from-ordinary childhood. He is a product of one of Vought's Supe testing labs and was made from the egg of an unknown donor and the stolen semen of Soldier Boy to be the world's greatest superhero and Vought's most valuable weapon.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the lab is Homelander's childhood home and where he spent his whole life until he was old enough to be revealed to the world. But his upbringing was deeply traumatic as in earlier seasons it is revealed that he was put through painful and traumatic physical experiments and surgeries to test the true limits of his abilities including being boiled alive, severe mental conditioning, and white room treatment.\n\nOn top of this, Homelander never had any family but found a father figure in Vought scientist Jonah Vogelbaum, who was with him for most of his life. However, this bond is broken when Homelander visits Vogelbaum in season 1 looking for answers but is met with the scientist in deep regret over his involvement with the Supe, telling him, \"You should have been raised in a home with a family who loved you. Not in a cold lab with doctors,\" adding that he is the greatest mistake he had ever made. Ouch.\n\nIt is clear that no well-functioning or healed person would do what Homelander did in episode 4, but it is no secret that Homelander suffers from a few mental illnesses that cloud his judgment and prompt him to do the most horrific things at the best of times. First off, he is deeply narcissistic and psychotic which is displayed in his lack of empathy and guilt when he murders innocent people. Second, he has deep childhood trauma which is reflected in his need to drink breastmilk and find a father figure.\n\nHis mental instability is obviously rooted in his traumatic upbringing in a lab where he had no human affection or emotion and was tortured from a very young age. From this, it is clear why the Supe went to take his anger and vengeance out on the very place that ruined his life from the very start. We see just how strong his want for a family was even as a child in a cut scene posted by The Boys' Twitter page, which shows a young Homelander latch into lab technicians in a desperate bid to find a family. Watch the clip below.\n\nBut why now? Why has Homelander waited until season 4 to take his revenge? When we first met Homelander in the first season he was a monster, yes, but he had everything going for him, being hugely popular and facing little to no opposition. But over time the Supe was revealed to the world as the very bad and deeply flawed person he is. The icing on the cake came in season 3 when Homelander finally found out that Soldier Boy is his biological father after the Captain America-like Supe broke out of a Soviet testing lab.\n\nHere's the stinger, when Homelander came face to face with Soldier Boy and even introduced him to his son and Soldier Boy's grandson Ryan, he was met with no love or affection and was called \"weak.\" However, Soldier Boy was seemingly murdered by Maeve at the end of season 3, leaving Homelander unable to take out his anger on Soldier Boy, but also, once again, leaving him without any parental figure. Now in season 4 he is lonelier than ever and is showing clear signs of schizophrenia, talking to different versions of himself in the mirror.\n\nThe childhood trauma, deep daddy issues, and the fact that Homelander doesn't see humans as people but merely toys for his amusement, as he tells Ryan, is a clear answer as to why he inflicted so much pain and torture in the lab. But, is this the most unhinged we will see the Supe this season? We will just have to wait and see.\n\nThe Boys season 4 episodes 1-4 are available to stream on Prime Video right now with new episodes landing every Thursday.

First season was erratic but experimental, now Homelander is literally scaring viewers with every minute.\"\n\n\"Well, in an episode that highlighted the awful cycle of revenge and abuse, I thought Hughie forgiving A-Train was a pretty cool and meaningful counter,\" another wrote, highlighting that the episode, which also saw two of Starlight's most personal secrets outed, wasn't all doom and gloom.\n\nA reminder, however, that The Boys season 4 may be going even further than what we just witnessed.\n\n\"I would just like to add that I was in [post-production] today, working on a season 4 scene that miiiiiiight be the batshit craziest thing we've ever done? Like I truly can't believe we got away with it,\" showrunner and creator Eric Kripke wrote on Twitter last year.\n\nThat's backed up by Homelander himself, Antony Starr. \"There has to be a ceiling, but we can't seem to find it,\" he previously told Variety of one moment - and it's unclear if we've already seen it.\n\n\"I was looking at the person I was opposite, and I said, 'What are we doing? I can't believe this! I could have done anything else with my life, but here I am doing this?' It was truly the most bizarre thing I've ever done.\"\n\nFor more, check out our latest coverage on The Boys:", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bradley_russell@gamesradar.com", "name": "Bradley Russell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudgie_the_Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fudgie the Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4LdPiSZeNyAJWyhxZJPH4T-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1467, "textEnd": 1472}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Explained | The Mary Sue", "body": "Stan Edgar, played by Giancarlo Esposito in Eric Kripke's The Boys, has had some of the best lines on the show. Remember when he told Homelander (Antony Starr) to his face, \"You're not a God. You're just bad product\"?\n\nYeah, so where's this guy in The Boys season 4 huh? Well, it's a long story.\n\nStanford Edgar, or Stan Edgar, is the former CEO of Vought International. He's an elusive figure in season 1, with company vice president Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue) running the show at Vought for him. He appears briefly in the season 1 finale, at a party thrown by Vought, to offer Stillwell a bonus after the Pentagon classifies Compound V as a controlled substance.\n\nAfter Stillwill's death in season 1, Stan Edgar takes on a bigger role in season 2. He appoints Stormfront (Aya Cash) to the Seven, and when Homelander confronts him about this decision, Edgar shuts him down with his epic \"We are not a superhero company. We are a pharmaceutical company\" monologue.\n\nAfter Starlight/Annie January (Erin Moriarty) leaks that the supes get their powers from Compound V, Edgar is the one who sends the Seven after a supposedly super-powered terrorist, who The Boys earlier found out to be Kimiko's (Karen Fukuhara) brother, Kenji (Abraham Lin). With The Boys trying to save Kenji, and The Seven trying to capture him, Kenji escapes but is tracked and killed by Stormfront, in disobedience of Homelander's orders. A few civilians also die in the process, and she puts the whole blame on Kenji.\n\nThis gives Stan Edgar the perfect excuse to frame deceased Vought VP Madelyn Stillwell and a band of rogue Vought scientists for Compound V while arguing that the world still needs superheroes to defend against such super terrorists.\n\nEdgar's ultimate mission is to place both supes and Vought's Compound V tech into the military. However, at the end of season 2 when Stormfront's Nazi truth is revealed, his plans are put on hold.\n\nIn season 3 episode 1, Hughie (Jack Quaid) is working for Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) as a liaison for her Federal Bureau of Superhuman Affairs when he finds out that Neuman is actually a supe herself, and the one exploding people's heads. He traces her past to Red River, an orphanage for supes who've killed their parents, and there discovers that Neuman's real name is Nadia, and she's the secretly adopted daughter of Vought CEO Stan Edgar.\n\nMeanwhile, Stan is busy trying to rehabilitate the image of The Seven by appointing Starlight as a co-captain alongside Homelander. He also asks Neuman to get her Bureau to slap some fines on Vought to show that Homelander can't get away with whatever he wants.\n\nHowever, Nueman and Homelander execute a coup. In a press conference, Neuman brings corruption charges against Stan Edgar, with Homelander as the whistleblower. She has secretly made a deal with Homelander, who gives her Compound V, which she then uses on her daughter.\n\nHomelander, is of course, ecstatic that Stan Edgar has been compelled to take a leave of absence. But not before Edgar leaves him with a parting thought: With both Stillwell and Edgar gone, who's going to cover for Homelander now? We see the fallout from this in the rest of season 3 and now in season 4, where Homelander is increasingly losing his mind and struggling to keep up his front of being America's savior and hero.\n\nIn true The Boys style of parodying real-world political events, last year, the Vought International X account tweeted a clipping of news that classified documents were found at Stan Edgar's home, mirroring what happened with former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nWe can assume that Stan Edgar might reappear this season or in the final season in some capacity, perhaps to check on his daughter's power or to bring down Homelander.\n\nHe's sure to look cool and say some fantastic lines while doing it!", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors":

This week's episode, \"Life Among The Septics,\" is a leading example of that dichotomy working in tandem together. As always, there was almost too much happening to comment upon everything in an even remotely adequate matter, but let's give this a shot.\n\nHomelander's visit \"home\" happens to be the centerpiece of this week's mayhem (next week takes a completely different detour into other characters' current horror), so congrats on the huge episode for \"John.\" Sorry, I meant \"Homelander.\" (Please do not laser me, Homie, like you did to this guy after making him unsuccessfully pleasure himself in front of an entire room of fellow scientists while you mercilessly cackled.)\n\nWhere to start? Let's recall how odd it was when far-right types melted down over realizing (during the third season) that Homelander has been a villain for the entirety of The Boys. He remains the worst Supe, and what transpires in this episode tracks with the rest of his most horrific misdeeds of the series:\n\n- Sending a plane full of passengers to crash to their deaths while flying away;\n\n- Making Deep eat his friend, Timothy the octopus, while the poor critter was still alive. (See also pretending to make Deep service A-Train while Ashley approvingly looked on);\n\n- Rewriting the entire narrative of the Gen V finale's most climactic scene and lasering the heck out of Marie while framing the so-called \"Godolkin Four\" as the perpetrators of the campus bloodbath;\n\n- Jerking off atop a skyscraper and letting his little Homelanders fall where they may, causing god only knows how much collateral damage on civilians;\n\n- And I could never omit Homie killing a civilian in broad daylight.\n\nDuring this week's The Boys episode, we receive some Homelander backstory when he goes back to visit the lab where he spent his childhood after being born as Soldier Boy's biological son. Of course, this isn't the first time we've seen earlier Homelander days. The Diabolical animated spin off showed us the disastrous first outings of Homelander as a \"hero,\" but this is the most graphically detailed time that we've caught a glimpse of Homelander's upbringing, when he was considered too dangerous (from the moment that he was born) to leave the lab and stayed locked up as a Vought prisoner.\n\nNow, the most evil Supe has returned home to wreak vengeance upon those who treated him so callously. None of what we see excuses what Homelander has done after leaving the lab, but at least we understand more about how he became this monster. And after he incinerated a scientist alive, lasered the aforementioned guy's dong off, and then slaughtered the rest of the group off camera (leaving a pseudo-maternal figure alive but trapped inside the room with the carnage), this face emerges:\n\nDude can hold a grudge. Nothing will ever fill the void in his soul, however, and, there's no justifying anything that the guy does even if The Boys gives us occasional moments where it makes more sense.

Ambrosius' desire for affection may push The Deep to choose between loyalty to her or to Homelander. The Deep could potentially become a spy against Homelander with the help of A-Train, risking it all for freedom.\n\nCBR VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe following contains spoilers for The Boys Season 4, Episode 1-3, which debuted Jun. 13 on Prime Video. It also contains a mention of sexual assault.\n\nWhen it comes to Chace Crawford's The Deep on The Boys, he ranks highly among the most despised characters. It stems from Season 1 when he forced Starlight to perform intimate acts against her will. Luckily, she outed him for his sexual assault and abuse of power. Since then, The Deep has been trying to reform.\n\nThe Deep was sent to rehab by the Seven and Vought International, only to end up being bullied by Antony Starr's Homelander. The villain thinks The Deep is frail, weak and a coward, but he keeps him around as he tests well with audiences. As Season 4 kicks off, The Deep is staring down the barrel of more trouble. It revolves around his octopus girlfriend -- Ambrosius. What makes it even more hilarious and engaging is who's voicing her: the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Tilda Swinton.\n\nWhat Is Tilda Swinton's Ambrosius Up to in The Boys Season 4?\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Showrunner Shares the Story Behind Butcher's Crude Photo\n\nThe Boys showrunner Eric Kripke reveals who that really was in the crude picture sent by Billy Butcher.\n\nSwinton has had many emotional, jaw-dropping roles in her career. She has done dramas like The Beach and was the angel, Gabriel, in Keanu Reeves' Constantine. In modern pop culture, however, Swinton is best known as the MCU's Ancient One. Her character mentored Stephen Strange before she died and passed the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme. She also worked with Hulk in Avengers: Endgame to help him understand the time-heist that Earth's Mightiest Heroes needed to pull off. In The Boys, Swinton's cameo has snark and acerbic wit, but there is a lot of heart as well. Notably, her Ambrosius did appear in The Boys Season 3, but in a non-speaking role.\n\nThe Deep found her in the \"Herogasm\" episode at the party the TNT Twins held. He hooked up with her, only for Starlight to record it and blackmail him. Since then, The Deep has kept Ambrosius at his apartment in a glass tank by his bed. Season 3 even had The Deep trying to convince his wife, Cassandra, to have a threesome with him and the octopus. Cassandra left the marriage, but as The Boys Season 4 unravels its first three episodes, Ambrosius is very much in play. This time, however, The Deep is hiding her away from his bedside, as he knows that Homelander hates the idea of him mating with aquatic life.\n\nHomelander has already made The Deep eat an oceanic associate and ex, Timothy, as punishment, making it clear he will push The Deep to cannibalism again. He cannot afford a PR scandal and The Deep sullying his superhero clique. This doesn't sit well with Ambrosius at all. She laments the lack of affection and romance. Swinton laces her words with forlorn love, pathos and a yearning for a human connection. She even calls The Deep by his real name, Kevin, but he is scared of getting physical. It's not just about protecting himself, but saving Ambrosius.\n\nDespite his consternation, the amorous cephalopod keeps using her sultry voice to ask him to run away. She wants to elope to the oceans and be free, but Kevin lives in fear. He has to keep the lie up. But as much as he maintains the ruse, it is apparent he thinks she is his soulmate and true love. Otherwise, he wouldn't have her around after their fling. He is simply terrified of Vought and Homelander needing him to be a certain presentable hero.\n\nThe Deep Is Playing a Dangerous Game in The Boys Season 4\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan and The Boys Showrunner Tease New Spinoff\n\nThe Boys is coming to an end, but the story might continue with a spinoff focused on Jeffrey Dean Morgan's new character.\n\nWhat makes The Deep's deceit risky is that he is hiding the octopus right in plain sight at Vought Tower. Homelander wants him close by to monitor him. But if this evil Superman uses his super-hearing or breaks in, he'll find out about Deep's lies. This won't be the first time The Deep has bent the truth. He was extorted before, along with A-Train, and leaked intel from Vought. The Deep needs to keep a clean slate, or if Homelander traces the past, all of his dirty laundry can be aired.\n\nIt doesn't help that former Vought CEO, Ashley, hates The Deep. She's trying to get back into Homelander's good graces and be more than just a personal assistant. Thus, she could snoop and offer up The Deep as a sacrifice. She knows Homelander would hate that his human side is back. He could make an example out of Kevin to scare new recruits like The Boys' Sister Sage and Firecracker. It'll come down to loyalty. If The Deep remains loyal to Ambrosius, he'll endanger them both.\n\nIf The Deep has to remain devoted to Homelander, he'll have to set her free, or worse, kill her if he gets caught. Eating Timothy already gave him PTSD and created the Timothy Foundation out of guilt. He wouldn't want to endure pain like that again. Another problem is that Ambrosius may want him to get caught. She hates being locked away in the closet, not being able to touch her lover. If she thinks Vought has corrupted Kevin, and he's choosing them over her, she could end up trying to escape.\n\nBreaking that aquarium and spilling water out of the room on Floor 99 will raise red flags. Punishment will be the likeliest consequence. If Ambrosius does find out The Deep is still being unfaithful with other humans, then the octopus could unleash some fury of her own. It's a huge gamble, because if she attacks The Deep, it will raise alarm bells. The point is, Kevin is playing with fire. He might be the King of the Seven Seas, as an Aquaman pastiche, but he'll be no match for an angry Homelander.\n\nAmbrosius Could Push The Deep to Become a Spy in The Boys Season 4\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Showrunner Dishes on [SPOILER]'s Return in Season 4 Premiere\n\nErik Kripke explains why The Boys brings back a key character from the past in Season 4.\n\nHistory may well repeat itself. If The Deep's hatred of Homelander grows, he might want to backstab him and gain freedom. Homelander bullied him and nearly forced him into a sexual act with The Boys' A-Train in the Season 4 premiere, so there is resentment stirring. Ironically, A-Train has become an informer for the heroes. He saved Jack Quaid's Hughie Campbell from Homelander and is feeding information to the Boys to help bring Homelander down.\n\nIf A-Train senses The Deep can be turned, that would give the heroes a second spy. It would be familiar territory for the villains, but this time, they might go the full-length in terms of redemption. A major problem, however, would be The Deep hooking up with Sage. She is enjoying her promotion as CEO, so she can keep The Deep on a leash. Still, The Deep wants his Kevin identity back. He thought coming back to the Seven would heal him, but all it did was torment his soul.\n\nThe crew assembled by Karl Urban's Billy Butcher feels like it's the only way out for Kevin. He'll have to maneuver smartly because Ashley is always around. She doesn't trust him, while Sage knows there is a mole who gave the Boys crucial evidence to demonize Homelander's fans. Once these women ramp up their investigation, it's going to be very perilous for Kevin. The clock is ticking and America is on the verge of a civil war.\n\nOnce war happens and Homelander makes the country a military superhero state, The Deep might never be able to escape the fascist dictator's clutches. This may well be Kevin's last shot at love, so if he has to pick a side to avoid Homelander's wave of hate and currents of war, The Deep needs to do so as soon as possible.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 debuts

Homelander's vulnerability and madness in seeking approval reveal deeper layers to his character. Visual effects elevate disturbing scenes, like Sister Sage's attraction to pain, creating intense moments.\n\nWe're at the halfway point with Season 4 of The Boys, but the Prime Video series definitely isn't doing anything halfway, especially when it comes to digging deeper into the tortured past that certainly has played a role in shaping Homelander (Antony Starr). Confronted with the fact that his super-powered teenage son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) could very well steal the spotlight from him, brining deep-seated insecurities to the forefront, sent Homelander into a tailspin that led him to return to the place where he grew up. With no idea what was in store for them, he showed the Vought lab workers exactly what he's capable of while seeking satisfaction from vengeance.\n\nDuring this one-on-one interview with Collider about episode 404, entitled \"Wisdom of the Ages,\" showrunner Eric Kripke talked about sending Homelander home and exploring why he's so driven by revenge, the process for how Homelander's reactions and actions evolved, the approach Starr wanted to take with it all, and why an Emmy Award is long overdue for his performance. Kripke also discussed Sister Sage's (Susan Heyward) disturbing idea of relaxation, giving props to the visual effects department, and that duet between Firecracker (Valorie Curry) and The Deep (Chace Crawford), for which they recorded a full version.\n\nThe Boys TV-MASuperheroAction Sci-FiDramaCrime\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019 Creator Eric Kripke Cast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash Seasons 4 Studio Amazon Studios Homelander's Tortured Past Drove Him to His Season 4 Revenge in 'The Boys'\n\nCollider: Did you always have a plan to do an episode exploring Homelander's past this season?\n\nERIC KRIPKE: When we were really starting Season 4, we spent a month or two really breaking down the season-wide stories and the character arcs. We try to dig a little deeper every year with the characters and, after four seasons, you really get to be like, \"Okay, now we've dug into the core existential trauma of who they are,\" and that is true for a lot of them. It's true for Hughie and Kimiko and Frenchie and Annie and Homelander. And so, it made a lot of sense to finally send him home and really dig in, for the first time, with all the stuff that we've hinted at up to now, which is this horrific way in which he was raised and which he gets equally horrific revenge for.\n\nThe \"Get in the oven moment\" is horrifying on so many levels, with everything that represents. No matter what he might have been put through, you can't really have any sympathy for him.\n\nKRIPKE: No, and I don't think we're proposing that you should. I don't think anyone's saying that you should be sympathetic towards Homelander. It's more that I want the audience to understand who he is. I'm not endorsing any of that. That's all bad behavior, let me be clear.\n\nRelated The Best Part of 'The Boys' Is All Around You\n\nThe fourth season of the Prime Video series reminds audiences why Vought's presence is so terrifying.\n\nDoes he really forgive Frank while he's cooking him, or is it more a feeling of being satisfied by vengeance?\n\nKRIPKE: It came from really long conversations between me and Ant [Starr]. The first draft of the script was that Homelander came down there and was just cruel, from start to finish, and he just wanted revenge. It was Ant who said, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's right. It's like when you go home and you turn into who you were when you were there. He's just being like that kid again, so I think he would be vulnerable and insecure and wanting their approval. But then, he's also really mad at them. He just wouldn't know how he'd be feeling, from one moment to the next.\" We really worked on the scene together and were playing it like he feels he's getting closer with this guy. Again, it's not sane behavior, but you're putting him in, for him, the most psychologically explosive environment, and you just can't expect him to behave rationally.\n\nWhich Homelander Moment Does 'The Boys' Showrunner Think Was Antony Starr's Scariest?\n\nThe whole sequence following that, between Homelander and Marty, is not about what he makes him do, but it's more about how it makes him feel and how uncomfortable it is for really everyone else in the room. What was it like to see that scene play out, the first time? How did you get to that moment?\n\nKRIPKE: To be clear, what Ant is doing in that scene is not scripted. The dialogue is scripted. What Marty does is scripted. But Ant, with that laughter and glee and how much he's enjoying it, all came from him on the day. When I first saw it, I've cut hundreds of hours of Homelander film and I've seen countless scenes with him, but that could be the title for the scariest I've ever seen him, which is saying something. Ant's instincts in that scene are just so intense. It's so long overdue, just give that guy an Emmy already.\n\nRelated 'The Boys' Will Come to an End Sooner Rather Than Later\n\nEric Kripke's promises \"a gory, epic, moist climax.\"\n\nIn this episode, we learn that Sister Sage likes some pretty invasively violent things. What was all that like to figure out, with that moment between her and The Deep, and how it would look to have her get stabbed through the eyeball? How did those two actors feel about the moment?\n\nKRIPKE: To be clear, he's never really had to stab her with an ice pick. It was all just visual effects. We knew we wanted Sage, as the world's smartest person, to just be miserable by her brain and almost at war against her own brain. For a long time, what was in the story was that she was gonna be huffing spray paint in a bag. For a while, I've actually been really interested in the notion that was really prevalent in the fifties and sixties of these frontal lobotomies. That's a real thing that people did to thousands and thousands of victims. Rose Kennedy got one. And people have such a weird fucking thing about eyes. It's just funny that eyes are a thing for people. So, I was like, \"You should give her a frontal lobotomy. We should do that. She relaxes by giving herself a lobotomy because that is gonna be brutal to watch.\" Sure enough, the fact that it's so brutal is completely due to the vfx department. On the day, it was just those two actors staring at each other, with nothing close to her face. That is a feather in Stephan Fleet's, our vfx supervisor's, cap.\n\nYes, Chace Crawford and Valorie Curry Really Sang Their 'The Boys' Duet Close\n\nTo end on a lighter note, how did you end up with a duet with Firecracker and The Deep, and how did you pick the perfect song for them?\n\nKRIPKE: We needed to understand what this six- or eight-hour marathon of Truth Bomb would be that's going on. It couldn't all be news and rants. There had to be entertainment, and we thought it would just be so funny for them to sing a duet. If I remember correctly, the original song idea was, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" but we couldn't get the rights. Whoever had the rights probably wisely didn't give them to us. So, that's how we got to \"Love Lift Us Up (Where We Belong).\" We just wanted this big, huge, epic duet, like it was Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers up there. And they both actually sang. We brought them into Chris Lennertz's studio and they sang the song for real, and then they lip-synced it on the day.\n\nRelated Chace Crawford Asks \"The Deep\" Questions in New 'The Boys' Season 4 Promo\n\n'The Boys' fourth season premieres Thursday, June 13.\n\nI was like, \"No, don't cut away! I need more of this!\"\n\nKRIPKE: For the record, somewhere, maybe on X-Ray, we'll release it. The entire song exists on film and will be released.\n\nThe Boys is available to stream on Prime Video.

That's a question that might be worth raising as Homelander (Antony Starr) continues nailing down his future in a world he could destroy, by looking to the past he wishes he could probably do the same to. The origin of the Seven's psychopathic leader has always been teased throughout \"The Boys\" but it's only now in Season 4, Episode 4, \"Wisdom of the Ages,\" that we really get a look into what molded the star-spangled monster -- and it marks one of the most disturbing moments in the dark history of Homelander.\n\nWhat feels like a quality control inspection becomes anything but that as Homelander proceeds to mess with lab technicians he knows by name, killing them (as expected) in particularly heinous ways. This isn't like squishing the head of a purse snatcher or wiping out a terrorist group, though. It becomes quickly apparent that there's a history in this off-the-books facility and Big H is having a twisted time revisiting it all.\n\nFrom throwing one in a furnace to humiliating another before lasering away his genitals, there really is no stopping Homelander. But then what else is new? Be it a scientist or spineless super that's a few levels down from him, it really does seem like there's nothing to hold back Homelander and his homicidal activities. More importantly though, with the bloody bar raised in this week's episode, it makes you wonder just how things could get in the future.", "source": {"uri": "looper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Looper.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisdom of the Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlife_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midlife crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_television_broadcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lost television broadcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/the-boys-season-4-episode-4-has-homelanders-most-disturbing-moments-by-far/l-intro-1717032394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

It's also one of the most important arcs because The Boys takes us into the laboratory where he was molded to become one of the most notoriously evil Supes. It's interesting how there are zero flashbacks in episode four. What we do get is Homelander verbally explaining the torture he suffered. This technique of relying on his narration versus seeing a young John go through it works primarily because it lets Starr go completely berserk by the minute. Gosh, he's terrific and terrifically scary in this episode as Homie's bloodthirsty self enjoys lashing out at the doctors who put him through hell as a teen.\n\nThe Boys teased this was coming at the end of episode three when Homelander's split personalities call out to him from the mirror. He's deeply unhappy, duh. Killing people or being worshipped isn't bringing him the ecstasy he's used to. Nothing is working, not even the anti-Starlight (Erin Moriarty) campaign he's begun with Sister Sage (Susan Heyward). So the more evil version encourages him to go back to the start, which leads him to the underground lab he was raised in. And we get a live-action glimpse at it after learning more about his origins in The Boys: Diabolical, Prime Video's 2022 animated spinoff. If you didn't see it (it's a good show!), don't worry: \"Wisdom Of The Ages\" gets you up to speed.\n\nWe know Homelander is Soldier Boy's (Jensen Ackles) son after he donated his sperm in 1980. To turn him into the god-loving patriot that Americans will adore, Vought kept him locked up as a child until he was ready to join the Seven. Through this period, which Homie revisits during this hour, he suffered immensely and hasn't forgotten a single second of it. Now he's come back for revenge, hoping that miserably hurting the people who hurt him might bring some relief. Does it work? His super satisfied, covered-in-blood face at the end of the episode says it probably did.\n\nThe nervousness sets in as soon as those damn elevator buttons ding when \"Wisdom Of The Ages\" starts. Homelander enters the office with a cake -- not the worst last meal, I suppose -- and reconnects with the couple of people who helped Vought rear him. His method of torture feels slow and miserable because you know it's coming. No one in that room, including the new employees, are walking out alive. The first to go is Frank (Mark Cowling). Homelander burns him in the same oven where, years ago, he was caged inside with Frank increasing the temperature to see if his skin would burn. It didn't set him on fire, but Homie says, \"My tears sizzled away,\" and that's a chilling description of his agony.\n\nThe next victim is Marty (Murray Furrow), who went from being a low-level employee to a major player since Homelander joined The Seven. That doesn't matter. His fate is sealed because he once laughed at John after catching him with his pants off. You can't help but feel sorry when Homie recalls that masturbating in the two minutes of privacy he got at night was the happiest he felt as a teen. The Boys' writers find an incredibly vivid way to dig into the complex emotions of a horrible man during a pivotal time. I'm glad we don't see it, as hearing about it is enough of a gut punch. It's a vicious cycle: He was treated horribly, and now he's returning it tenfold. To avenge being nicknamed \"squirt,\" Homie makes Marty jerk off in front of everyone, passing comments along the way like \"It looks like you're shucking a little mushroom.\" When Marty doesn't get hard, despite spitting, his dick gets lasered off and eventually, his head is squashed like a bug. Yeah, it's a lot, and it's not over yet.\n\nHomelander seeks ultimate vengeance when his old pal and doctor in charge Barbara (Nancy Lenehen) finally trots in. She witnesses her worst creation murder everyone in the \"bad room\" and splay a shit ton of blood across the white walls. Her punishment is that the picture will be burned in her brain forever. Oof. Homie leaves the lab looking smug and happy (the bookend of the episode beginning and ending with the elevator buttons is a nice touch), but I fear his actions here will motivate him to get worse. The Boys repeatedly tells us Homelander is vile and unkillable. With him brushing off his past, what's stopping him now? Is it too much gore even for this show? I appreciate the insight into his upbringing but damn, I felt exhausted by another reminder of how awful Homelander is, and I suspect I won't be alone in that.\n\nWe're talking about The Boys, so, of course, Homelander's arc wasn't the only wild sight (we'll get to Sage and Deep this time, don't worry). Everyone goes through something major, even Hughie (Jack Quaid). Is he still being insanely stupid and unhelpful? Yes, but at least he fights to save himself alongside Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and ultimately makes the right choice. He wants to give his dying dad Compound V against Kimiko and Butcher's (Karl Urban) advice. Hughie gets a vial after A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) steals it from Homelander's house, but decides against it on Hughie Sr.'s deathbed. Too bad his mother Daphne (Rosemary DeWitt) had the same idea and executed it. Lo and behold, Simon Pegg will now have something to do again besides being horizontal and quiet.\n\nElsewhere, Annie, a.k.a. Starlight, has a miserable day when Sage spearheads a plan to televise Firecracker's (Valorie) hate-spewing. They set up a stage across the Starlight Home, and Firecracker goes off, spreading nonsense lies but also revealing to the world that Annie had an abortion six months ago. (She and Hughie decided together, we learn later on). Her medical records being leaked is Annie's last straw. She flies onto the stage and almost beats her nemesis to a pulp -- it's all caught on camera, so the zealous Christians have yet another reason to take her down while supporting Firecracker and Vought. Dare I say, though, that their rivalry is going through some repetitive beats?\n\nAnnie gets help from Frenchie (Tomer Capone), MM (Laz Alonso), and Butcher to no avail. Although Butcher, whose visions of Becca (Shantel SanVanten) are back as a sign that his health is getting worse, has some secret power looming within thanks to Compound V. Even he's surprised by how strong he might be because the man he was fighting completely bursts open. And, yes, there's the Sage and Deep (Chace Crawford) situation. I wasn't entirely sure if the brief shot of a bloody arrow in episode three meant lobotomy, but yeah, that's where we're at. A bunch of commenters did point it out, and you were right!).\n\nSage requests Deep to perform a frontal lobotomy to slow down her expanding brain. She doesn't want to be the smartest person in the world for a few hours, she wants to chill and be someone else. That explains her mixed reactions to Deep and why she excitedly sleeps with him as soon as he does it. Does thi explain why she so quickly agreed to team up with Homelander, join The Seven, and cause chaos? She's such a fascinating new character, as is Firecracker. I wonder how the remaining four episodes will dig into their backstories more. Anyway, that's The Boys for you, huh?", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Previously, he wrote about entertainment for places like Rotten Tomatoes, Inverse, TheWrap and The Hollywood Reporter. Aaron is also an actor and stay-at-home dad, which means coffee is his friend.\n\nThe first three episodes of The Boys dropped last Thursday to Prime Video and set the stage for a bleaker set of storylines. In turn, it feels as if the amusing luster of the first three seasons has worn a bit to reveal its dark underbelly.\n\nThe overarching themes of childhood trauma and legacy continue to permeate in episode 4, Wisdom of the Ages. Billy Butcher grapples with his mortality as he begins to suspect something monstrous may be going on with his health. Homelander goes back to his childhood home. Annie buckles under Firecracker's continuous attacks on live TV. And, basically, all hell breaks loose.\n\nRead more: 'The Boys' Season 4 Release Schedule and How To Stream From Anywhere\n\nIt goes without saying that heavy spoilers abound below. If you're ready to revisit the journey taken by Homelander, Annie and the rest in episode 4, let's go.\n\n\"You need to go back to the start,\" Homelander's dominant reflection told him in episode 3. \"John, you need to go home.\"\n\nHomelander's hates his given name. As he steps out of the elevator into Vought's secret lab in episode 4's opening moments, his disdain for the moniker once again bubbles to the surface. He does his best to mask it, though. And he succeeds for a short time.\n\nArmed with a smile and a Fudgy, the Whale ice cream cake, Homelander makes himself at home, much to the discomfort and terror of the scientists in the room. Two scientists named Marty and Frank get the brunt of attention and end up receiving his inevitable wrath.\n\nFrank goes first.\n\nIt starts innocently enough, with Homelander challenging him to a game of waste paper basketball. He learned the game as a kid, watching the lab worker kill time at his desk while young John was in the incinerator being burned alive.\n\n\"Even though my skin didn't char, it still really hurt,\" Homelander tells him before sending him to a fiery death in the very same oven.\n\nOne of Annie's initiatives has been getting Robert Singer's Supe control bill passed, and it feels like an achievable goal, too. On the other hand, her mission to help troubled teens hits a seemingly immovable roadblock.\n\nVought International stages Firecracker's new live show, TruthBomb: The Children's Freedom Fighter, across the street from Starlight House.\n\nMother's Milk brings Butcher back into the fold to break Firecracker's resolve by threatening to bring a scandal from her past to life. It backfires on them, with the conspiracy theory-loving Supe airing her dirty laundry live on TV: She had inappropriate relations with a 15-year-old boy.\n\nShe pivots the controversy and shifts gears, again putting Annie on the chopping block. She talks about Annie's first save. When she was just a teen, in an attempt to save hostages at a Walmart, Annie blinded a mom of three. But this info was just the appetizer to a detestable main course. With Annie's medical records as proof, Firecracker reveals to the world Annie and Hughie's difficult decision to have an abortion.\n\n\"You gonna tell me those teens over there are safe with her, with that baby killer?\" Firecracker says to the camera, relishing in the moment. And then the storm hit. Annie beats Firecracker to a pulp, all in front of the rolling cameras, which broadcast the brawl live on TV. Starlight's partnership with Singer immediately ends, leaving her future hanging in the balance.\n\nSister Sage's plan was right on track. \"First pebble down the mountain,\" she said, watching it unfold on TV.\n\nIs Butcher dying from Temp V, or is there a monster growing underneath his skin?\n\nAfter his plan to blackmail Firecracker backfired, he sent Frenchie to her trailer to \"give it a toss.\" As you might expect, this could have gone better. Ezekiel discovers Frenchie.\n\nYou remember Ezekiel. We were first introduced to him in season 1 as Starlight's youth pastor. Secretly a Supe, he can stretch and bend his limbs like a perverse Mr. Fantastic. Butcher arrives just in time to save Frenchie and nearly dies at Ezekiel's hand (err, giant snake-like arm). He passes out, and, in the unconscious blackness, something else takes over.\n\nOnce Butcher comes to, he finds the trailer smattered with copious amounts of blood with pieces of Ezekiel all over the damn place. Did his Temp V use create a super-powered parasite inside his body?\n\nMarty, the lab's assistant director, was \"mostly nice\" to young Homelander. That is, except for calling the boy \"Squirt\" after catching him with his pants down.\n\nAs punishment, Homelander has Marty take his pants down in front of everyone and tells him to perform. Is this the most Homelander has laughed at anything? His hysterics make Marty's murder that much more jarring. He eye-lasers a hole right through the man's pelvis.\n\nBarbara finally shows up. She's the boss. There's history between these two, and it shows.\n\n\"Did you come back here just to torment those people? Doesn't that feel a little small,\" Barbara says to Homelander.\n\nThe point of this homecoming was to deal with his childhood trauma, to let go of his shameful human need for love and acceptance. \"You'll never be able to overcome that,\" Barbara tells him. To prove her wrong, he kills everyone that's left and locks her in that room with their remains.\n\nHis vengeance is a success. But the act of revenge is inherently human. As much as he wants to fight it, so is Homelander.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supe_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverse (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_dad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stay-at-home dad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream_cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice cream cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laundry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/657c2ec3950754dc5e21a45cdca8101daf329ecd/hub/2024/06/20/57d1d163-18b4-45ca-9f63-c904946d8d64/the-boys-season-4-ep-4-butcher-mm.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

In fact, Edgar's willingness to insult Homelander by calling him an \"arrogant man-child\" is up there with the show's boldest moves.\n\nEsposito told GQ in 2023 that his character isn't afraid of Homelander because he \"realizes that Homelander's just a big kid and that he never got the validation that he needed from his father.\" He explained that Homelander \"needs to be validated by another man who says, yeah, you're powerful and good and all that. In return for that, Stan also feels like he's holding onto his power. He's able to control this loose cannon where no one else can.\" It's such a fascinating dynamic.\n\nBut why isn't Edgar part of season 4? Esposito's typically tremendous performance as the character was one of the primary reasons to watch it, so it's sad he's no longer appearing.\n\nDuring season 3 of The Boys, Stan Edgar recognized that Homelander's behavior was damaging The Seven's image and reputation. He made the more wholesome Starlight the team's co-captain and issued Homelander with several fines to teach him a lesson.\n\nThe final part of his plan involved conspiring with Victoria Neuman -- a congresswoman, the Federal Bureau of Superhuman Affairs' founding director, and his adoptive daughter -- to hold a press conference denouncing Homelander's behavior and telling the world he could no longer do whatever he pleased.\n\nHowever, having done some colluding of her own with Homelander, Neuman betrayed Edgar by announcing that The Seven's leader had come forward as a whistleblower about crimes committed by her adoptive father.\n\nA shocked Edgar was forced to take a leave of absence from Vought before the company officially announced they were severing ties with him. He is now considered retired.\n\nWhether the character returns to the show remains to be seen. However, in a 2004 chat with GQ UK, Esposito said of The Boys, \"This is a show I never want to leave because I just love the swagger of Stan Edgar. He's a company man, but he's not a company man like you've seen before. He is the company.\" He even said he wants his character to get some superpowers, saying, \"I want Stan Edgar to get some V, man. Give me some temporary V so I can be a badass and f*** 'em all up. Come on, I want that temporary V, baby. I wanna get in the action.\"\n\nIt's good to know Esposito is open to a return -- and seeing his character with superpowers would undoubtedly be awesome. For now, however, he's nowhere to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_stewart@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Kevin Stewart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Esposito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Mysticism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Mysticism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Educational_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Educational Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Human_Interaction", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Human Interaction", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stan-edgar_938389.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

For the gory Prime Video series this doesn't mean a fun trip down memory lane, but a terrifying, blood-drenched thriller of an episode where the villain meets his makers (literally, not figuratively).\n\nFans were shocked by the events of the episode, but before we examine what happened and why Starr's performance was so impressive be warned that this article contains some spoilers.\n\nWhat, how, and why?\n\nIn episode 4, Homelander decides to visit the scientists that made his youth a living hell by treating him like a test subject to learn the extent of his powers. To move past the pain Homelander decides to get his revenge, in scenes that take place almost entirely in the lab where he was kept for years.\n\nStarr excels in the disturbing sequences, which see him exude menace even when his words suggest otherwise. It is tense because the actor has such a threatening presence as Homelander, viewers can't predict what he will do next which adds to the fear for both the audience and the scientists in the room with him.\n\nThere are three scientists that he wants to punish, one he forces into the pressure oven where he was repeatedly burned as a child to test his durability, the other he forces to masturbate in front of everyone after the scientist laughed at him for doing the same thing in his cell as a teen. Both scientists end up dead by Homelander's hands.\n\nHomelander faces the final scientist who hurt him in a different way, he makes her to watch as he tears everyone else in the lab apart in front of her. The character then leaves, covered head to toe in blood, and smiles -- it's a chilling sequence to say the least and proves Starr's acting prowess.\n\nFans felt similarly impressed by Starr's performance, with many calling for him to win awards for his acting in the episode. One viewer said: \"Antony Starr YOU NEED AN EMMY SIR!!!!\", while another shared: \"GIVE ANTONY STAR HIS EMMY !\"\n\nOthers were both disturbed and in awe of the episode, with one writing: \"this is THE homelander episode\" and another commenting: \"And when you think Homelander couldn't get any worse!!! Sheeesh\"\n\nOne viewer also wrote: \"we might be witnessing the peakest of peaks for homelander in this episode holy s**t\", while another said: \"This episode is the best Antony Starr has been as homelander\".\n\nWhat else happened on The Boys?\n\nElsewhere in the episode fans were given their first glimpse at the characters of spin-off Gen V in the context of The Boys. Maria Moreau (Jaz Sinclair), Andre Anderson (Chance Perdomo), Emma Meyer (Lizzie Broadway), and Jordan Li (London Thor and Derek Luh) were shown in a news bulletin and were said to have disappeared after the events of the spin-off.\n\nCate Dunlap (Maddie Phillips) and Sam Riordan (Asa Germann) were depicted as the heroes who stopped the others from a murderous rampage. Viewers of the spin-off know otherwise, but this means that fans have a better understanding of when Gen V takes place in the context of the main series.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roxy_simons@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Roxy Simons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Luh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Luh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddie_Phillips", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maddie Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_Perdomo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chance Perdomo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaz_Sinclair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaz Sinclair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R.4zieRZXU9QS9U_pkfexg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD00OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/f3ca1080-2ee1-11ef-be6d-9521d0225f0a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Vought's Story Versus What Actually Happened", "body": "Homelander may be the most powerful Supe in the world, but in The Boys season 4, cracks are beginning to show. In this latest season, the character -- who's a satirical take on Superman and played flawlessly by Antony Starr -- becomes obsessed with aging (he may be invincible right now, but those bottled grey pubes he stores in his dresser indicate he's not immortal) and overcoming his humanity.\n\nOvercoming his humanity and constant desire for approval is a big thing for Homelander this season. In episode 3, we see his mental state begin to deteriorate when he starts talking to different versions of himself in a broken mirror.\n\n\"It's time to overcome this need for love, this sickness, once and for all,\" one of the voices tells him. \"You're never going to be your true self until you transcend your humanity.\" He asks the four of them what he should do, and they all reply in unison: \"You need to go back to the start. You need to go home,\" as images of medical tools and vault doors flash across the screen. In episode 4, we get more information on Homelander's origin story and it's bleak as hell.\n\nVought International, the ruthless corporation responsible for the Supes, would have the public believe that he's an alien who landed in the United States as an infant, much like Superman. In reality, though, he was grown in a secret laboratory using genetic material taken from Stormfront and Soldier Boy.\n\nThe identity of the woman who actually birthed him, however, isn't revealed. All we know about her, from Barbara's account, is that she was \"a runaway\" they paid $2,000 to bring the embryo to term. \"You lasered her guts out from the inside. You rose in the air with your umbilical cord still attached, like some creature out of myth. You killed three doctors and a nurse while you were at it,\" Vought scientist Barbara tells him in episode 4.\n\nWe learn that Homelander was tortured as a child by the company's scientists to see just how strong his powers of invincibility were. He was placed in an oven-like room for hours to see what effect extreme heat would have on him, and while he was never burned, it still caused him extreme pain.\n\n\"Everybody was terrified of you from your first breath, but we have no physical power over you, we never did,\" Barbara continues. \"You could have broken out of here, anytime you wanted. We couldn't have stopped you. But you didn't because you couldn't stand the idea that we would be disappointed in you.\"\n\nIn these moments, Homelander's expression noticeably shifts and you almost feel sorry for him. \"Vought brought in the best psychologists in the world and developed the protocol to carefully engineer that need so that you would be obedient. In many ways that was our greatest success,\" Barbara explains. \"Your need for love is so deep, it's so human, you'll never be able to overcome that.\"\n\nHomelander puts up his finger in protest. \"That's where you're wrong,\" he says. \"I'm not human, and neither is my son. I'm going to raise him so that he knows it.\" In a maniacal act of revenge, Homelander slaughters all the scientists but leaves Barbara alive.

Unfortunately, John was subject to inhumane experiments and now that his trauma has returned, Homelander wants his tormentors to answer for it.\n\nBringing the lab workers a cake to celebrate his return, Homelander has something more ominous in mind as he calls individual scientists who were cruel to him to get retribution for how he was mistreated decades ago.\n\nHomelander's return to his not-so-good old days sets the stage for a good old-fashioned episode of The Boys that returns to the irreverent tone that was sorely missed in this season's deathly serious third episode.\n\nHere are some other highlights from Episode 4 of The Boys Season 4, which is titled Wisdom of the Ages.\n\nNote: The following paragraphs reveal spoiler details from Episode 4.\n\nFor the most part, Wisdom of the Ages isn't as overtly political as the first three episodes of Season 4 of The Boys, which will probably be welcome news to the show's fans who would rather just be entertained instead of being barraged with ideological messaging.\n\nAs such, The Boys are back in full fighting form in Episode 4 and take part in several scenes of bloody mayhem where they defend themselves against some of Homelander's backers. There are also bits of welcome humor, including a singing duet featuring The Deep and Firecracker during The Truth Bomb broadcast.\n\nThat's not to say that showrunner Eric Kripke doesn't find room for commentary by slipping in some divisive political issues, specifically in The Truth Bomb broadcast with a hot-button issue that divides liberals and conservatives in real life.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see how Kripke balances his political motivations for The Boys with his not-so-subtle messaging in the final four episodes. Sure, Episode 1 was insanely entertaining, but there's no question that Season 4 hasn't been as packed as previous seasons with the irreverence and outlandish scenarios that made The Boys a must-watch series in the first place.\n\nAfter all, any show with a comic book theme should first and foremost be about escapism instead of reminders of today's heavily divided political landscape.

Tuning in every week is starting to feel risky.\n\nAre we going to have to watch a man human-centipede himself sexually in a steam room, or will the writers attempt to stir up feelings of compassion from us about the most horrific and cruel character on TV since Joffrey Baratheon on Game of Thrones?\n\nYeah, I was as shocked as anyone else, but the writers pulled off a miracle this week. On The Boys Season 4 Episode 4, we get more of a detailed look into Homelander's upbringing, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a tiny bit moved.\n\nLook, I'm not saying I'm a Homelander stan now, I'm just saying I feel a little bad for the guy. He didn't exactly have a picture-perfect childhood.\n\nAfter the trauma of being raised like a lab rat, is it that hard to believe that the guy drinks breast milk and collects his grey pubes in a jar?\n\nRelated: The Boys Ending With Season 5!!\n\nThe trip down memory lane was as difficult for Homelander as it was for us to watch. Did I want to watch a man be forced to masturbate in front of his colleagues? No. Was I shocked that it happened? Also no.\n\nI can't really explain why, but the fact that Homelander brought an ice cream cake down to the lab for everyone to share was so much creepier than if he'd just brought a regular cake. Maybe it made the scene feel more urgent as we waited for the Carvel classic to melt. Whatever it was, it made me uneasy.\n\nThen, actually watching everyone eat the ice cream cake in silence, awkward and anxious about what Homelander was going to do, was practically unbearable. Great job to the writers on that whole scene -- even if we took away the whole \"man being cooked alive\" thing and ignored the forced workplace masturbation, the vibes alone heebied my jeebies.\n\nLet's move on and talk about poor Ryan. There's next to no chance that this kid is going to turn into a healthy, well-adjusted adult, right?\n\nHomelander is pushing Ryan to be more visible to the public, and the plan is to get Ryan on camera pulling off a staged rescue. It should have been simple, but Ryan still doesn't really have a handle on what he can do, and tragically, he accidentally kills someone.\n\nHomelander is naturally completely unbothered, and this is pivotal for Ryan because it sets a precedent for how he should react when these kinds of things happen. He's struggling to reconcile Homelander's nonchalance about the death with the fact that he's feeling traumatized about it.\n\nThis wedge between father and son is bad news for Homelander, who has big plans for his progeny, but it's worse news for the rest of the world. Ryan seems pretty desperate to win Homelander's approval.\n\nHow far will he be willing to push himself to make his dad proud?\n\nAnd how much influence will Butcher have over the situation, especially while he's falling apart at the seams himself?\n\nButcher's veins are doing the worm again, and he's still hallucinating Becca as his condition deteriorates.\n\nIt's really interesting to watch him realize he's not going to get any better and try to get his affairs in order.\n\nI'll admit I got a little teary when he asked Mother's Milk to find a way to save Ryan if he's unable to do it himself before he kicks the bucket.\n\nRelated: The Boys Characters Who Deserve a Spotlight Episode\n\nUgh, and speaking of getting emotional, Hughie's father's condition worsened and now he's brain-dead.\n\nHughie is having a horrible time coping. It's a very human and relatable storyline in a show that generally steers clear of anything too realistic, and it's hard to watch him suffer.\n\nHughie's mom has power of attorney and decides to end life support, which makes the poor guy feel even more powerless than he already does in a world where he's surrounded by supes. So, it's no big shock when he ends up being desperate enough to save his dad that he tracks down a dose of Compound V.\n\nNow, is it a good idea? Hell no. Didn't we learn last season that messing with that stuff was a sure way to turn everything from bad to worse?\n\nIf not, what is it about Butcher's current health status that makes Hughie think, \"I know what will save my dad! The very stuff that is killing my friend!\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, I totally understand why he wants to try it, but with a little critical thinking, he'd probably realize it'll do more harm than good.\n\nIn other relationship news, Frenchie (who is now officially bisexual, to the great joy of thousands of LGBTQ+ fans) finally told Colin the truth about his connection to his family (you know, the fact that he brutally murdered all of them).\n\nEric Kripke isn't exactly known for his stellar treatment of queer characters (our hearts are still broken about Castiel from Supernatural, okay), so it's no big surprise that Frenchie doesn't appear to be getting a happily-ever-after story with Colin.\n\nKimiko is getting a new layer to her backstory this season, and we love to see it.\n\nThat is, we'd love to see it if it wasn't so damn tragic. We've now learned who the secret sniper woman is, and it's bleak.\n\nKimiko was a victim of human trafficking as a child (hence her silent breakdown about the trafficking conspiracy theories from last week's premiere). As it turns out, she participated in training the woman she's now faced with.\n\nThe more we learn about Kimiko, the more heartbreaking her story gets. She's lost everyone she's ever loved, she can't trust herself and her memories, she's so traumatized she can't even speak, and she's constantly getting \"killed\" in gruesome ways and then having to put herself back together.\n\nRelated: Gen V Season 1 Ending Explained: How it Connects to The Boys Season 4\n\nWhen will she get a break?!\n\nOh, and we can't forget to address the Starlight in the room.\n\nHer alliance with President-Elect Singer now blown, she's left to deal with the aftermath of Firecracker's reveal that Annie had an abortion.\n\nSomehow, the abortion news is more insidious to Firecracker's fans than the bombshell Firecracker dropped about her past inappropriate relationship with a minor.\n\nGo figure.\n\nNo one seems as concerned with the fact that Annie accidentally blinded a woman during her first save, but -- yikes.\n\nBefore we go, we can't forget about Sister Sage.\n\nLast week, we wondered what the strange metal stick on her coffee table was, and this week we found out!\n\nNo big deal. She's just recreationally lobotomizing herself to get a break from her own genius.\n\nNow that she's invited Deep into her activities, he's finally feeling appreciated and more confident, and there's no chance that's good news.\n\nPoor Ambrosius. Tilda Swinton may have lent you her sensual, velvety voice, but sadly that wasn't enough to keep Deep from straying with Sage.\n\nHere I go feeling bad for the jilted octopus again.\n\nRelated: Erin Moriarty, The Boys Star, Speaks Out Against \"Misogynistic Trolling\" By Fans\n\nThe episode ends with Butcher catching Hughie getting the stolen Compound V from A-Train. Butcher obviously has strong feelings about Hughie's plan, so it'll be interesting to see whether his warnings hold any weight for Hughie, who is growing more desperate by the minute to save his dad.\n\nAlright, fans. What was the best reveal of the episode? Was it a good continuation of the three-hour premiere?

In doing so, he terrorized all the researches and scientists responsible for his terrible childhood, while also leaving Barbara locked up in what's been described as the Bad Room.\n\nSpeaking to TVLine, Antony Starr made it clear that there was a lot of value to what you saw here, beyond just the fore and the violence of it all:\n\n\"I think it was a really important part of the journey and the season for the character, and overall, in the show, for the character, because I think he really believed that that was, like, a really great, cathartic, therapeutic exercise, going back there ... It was a little messy, particularly for other people, but I think, at the end, he comes out of it really thinking he's done the right thing and done something great to move forward, and he can be a better father now for the kid.\"\n\nIs this really going to be the case, though? Well, for the time being, we have a hard time thinking that this is necessarily true. Homelander thinks that he can clearly change himself but in the end, we're not so sure. He is always going to need the approval of others to a certain extent ... and if he doesn't, things are going to go badly. This could just end up being Homelander working in order to ensure that a lot of his worst instincts are enabled, and things could be even more violent from here.\n\nRelated - Be sure to learn more about The Boys, including the return of Giancarlo Esposito\n\nShare right now in the attached comments!

I kid, for the most part. But \"Wisdom of the Ages\" put me through the wringer in a way I'm not used to with this show. The Boys has always been over the top, but the lunacy usually comes with an element of joy even when we're watching something gross. There's not much that's joyful about this episode; it's one of the bleaker ones I can remember.\n\nWhen you tell a story like this one over the course of many hours, it's easy to lapse into misery porn. That's especially easy when a character like Homelander is involved; without facing any serious external challenge at any given point, he's essentially free to do whatever he wants, and that almost always entails making other people suffer. Watching rich, famous superheroes abuse their powers is a cornerstone of this show, even more so than watching vigilantes take them down. This is a show as much about the mechanisms and effects of corruption as it is about actually fighting that system.\n\nStill, even with Antony Starr's top-notch performance, watching Homelander torture and kill people isn't inherently interesting, especially this deep into the show. In broad strokes, we know where this story is going from the moment Homelander shows up in the basement lab where Vought scientists experimented on him during his upbringing: All of these people are going to die.\n\nTo a certain extent, the episode has some gruesome fun with that inevitability. I'm pretty desensitized to anything the show throws at me these days, even something as \"Oh my God\"-worthy as the Splinter rimming scene, but there's something pretty gnarly and unique about the way Homelander takes his first victim in this episode. Frank used to play wastepaper basketball while Homelander watched from the nearby oven, in constant agony while Frank tested his skin's resistance to burning. So he orders Frank to the oven, finally returning the favor and saying, \"I forgive you.\"\n\nIt's definitely in character for Homelander to think this is the ideal way to forgive his abusers and make peace with his past. But I needed the episode to push past that predictable reaction and illuminate something new about the main villain of the show, and I'm not sure it does. Next up is assistant director Marty, one of the \"kinder\" ones who was nonetheless complicit in Homelander's abuse -- he even nicknamed the kid \"squirt\" after catching him mid-masturbation one night. Fittingly, Homelander orders him to jerk off in front of everyone in the lab right now, threatening to laser his dick off if he can't get hard. Guess what happens?\n\nFollowing another brutal ending -- Homelander steps on Marty's skull, crushing it like a can while a nearby lab worker vomits -- he finally meets with Barbara, the lab director, who treats him as an equal instead of a god. She offers some insight: Recognizing Homelander's need for approval and love since his infancy, Vought further nurtured that dependence, and even today he can't conquer that drive. But in the end, her therapizing isn't nearly enough to truly shift his way of thinking, especially when he's determined to crush the human side of himself (and Ryan). He just leaves her isolated in \"the bad room\" with the freshly massacred lab workers, grinning as he rides the elevator back up.\n\nThese victims are far from innocent, of course, so it's not so much that I feel bad for them. It's more that it's just drawn out and unpleasant to watch. But outside that story, this is at least a pretty economical and focused episode, driven primarily by Firecracker's big Vought News debut. I've been missing the focus of seasons past -- for all of season three's inertia problems, it had the Soldier Boy arc to hold it all together -- but now that the season is in full swing, we have a general idea of what's at stake and where this could all be heading.\n\nFirecracker is key to Sister Sage's plan, which involves further radicalizing the Hometeamers by injecting fringe anti-Starlight content into the mainstream (a very familiar political tactic used by the far right). While they set up The Truth Bomb across the street from Starlight House and Firecracker begins her long screed, Mother's Milk resorts to getting help from Butcher. Together, they confront Firecracker during her break with the dirt they dug up: As a counselor at the Capes for Christ Bible camp, she had sex with a 15-year-old boy, copping a statutory-rape charge that Vought's lawyers got dropped. But Butcher and MM's effort to get info on Sage's plan doesn't work; instead of caving to their demands, Firecracker tweets out the scandal herself then takes the stage again to spin the narrative in her favor. She even contrasts the story of her journey to \"eternal salvation\" with Starlight's unatoned-for actions: During her first save at 13 years old, she accidentally blinded a hostage.\n\nAs bad as that is, Annie's mistake pales in comparison to the type of violence we routinely see on this show, especially considering her age at the time. But Firecracker lands a big one when she brings up Starlight's supposedly biggest spiritual failing: the abortion she got six months ago, something even we weren't aware of. How can we trust a \"baby killer\" to protect at-risk kids? Annie, understandably, immediately zooms across the street and beats the shit out of Firecracker, almost killing her before MM stops her and draws her attention to the cameras that caught the whole thing. It's exactly what Sage hoped for: Annie's \"good girl\" image is now tarnished, with both bad-guy politicians (Victoria Neuman) and good-guy politicians (Bob Singer) cutting ties.\n\nAs a piece of political commentary, I'm not sure this ending totally works. Yes, we're in a time where reproductive rights are extremely precarious in this country, and it's certainly believable that an Establishment Democrat like Dakota Bob would prioritize \"compromise\" instead of risking further alienation from conservative voters, especially with his supe control bill up in the air. But even with her evangelical past, would unveiling Starlight's medical records really be the potential career killer that this episode frames it to be? It makes sense for the onscreen assault to damage her image, but I would think most of the people pissed off by Starlight's abortion were never going to support Dakota Bob and his bill to begin with.\n\nStill, I'm interested in how many competing motivations are at play now. Sage doesn't respect the Deep, but she'll use him to lobotomize and fuck her if he's offering. Firecracker is even worse -- Sage resents being described with racist language like \"uppity\" and \"one of the good ones\" -- but she recognizes how the newest member of the Seven can be used for her agenda, especially if it means Sage gets to enjoy watching Firecracker get beaten up. Sage's genuine views are probably more aligned with Starlight than Firecracker, but that doesn't matter. She's more interested in total power than a progressive future.\n\nBut I still haven't totally gotten onboard with Frenchie's story this year, even if this episode finally pulls the trigger on Colin finding out the truth. We learn, first, that Colin was present when Frenchie murdered his family and even spotted the scar on his ankle from his hiding place under the bed. (The Russian mafia ordered the hit in retaliation for Colin's federal-judge mother trying to make an example out of Little Nina.) Then Frenchie admits the truth himself, tortured by Colin's endless kindness.\n\nColin starts whaling on Frenchie, which makes sense, but he ultimately can't go through with killing someone he loves (or loved), which also makes sense. But there's so much I wish we could've seen in this conversation. I imagine that in Colin's position, I'd be devastated and furious and overwhelmed, but also deeply confused. Shouldn't he demand answers from Frenchie about why he did what he did years ago and in these last few months?\n\nHughie's subplot in this episode is much more interesting, because it isn't totally siloed off from everything else. His mission to secure a vial of Compound V and save his dad's life also pulls in Kimiko, Butcher, and especially A-Train, whose redemption arc is in full swing. I really like how the show is handling that story, especially when it comes to Hughie's gradual forgiveness of the man who killed his girlfriend; while A-Train doesn't expect Hughie to ever really change his mind about him, they do shake hands and come to a real place of mutual respect and understanding after he fetches the V.\n\nButcher succeeds in changing Hughie's mind when he finds out his plans, so he ultimately doesn't go through with shooting up Hugh Campbell Sr. with supe juice. But Daphne Campbell has no problem doing it herself the moment Hughie leaves the room. Could his dad really make a full recovery, or will the V have some awful side effects? In this dark, dark season, every action has consequences.\n\n* This week in Gen V crossovers, we get a glimpse of supe interrogator Tek Knight and his show The Whole Truth, where he mentions the \"Godolkin 4\" vanishing into a gaping hole. We know from the end of Gen V's first season that those four were actually the heroes, quarantined somewhere under the watch of Vought after being framed for the massacre of non-supes on campus. The real people responsible were Cate and Sam, identified by Tek Knight as the Guardians of Godolkin.\n\n* \"I kind of murdered a bunch of them.\" Kimiko's continued comedy journey is a highlight, but the \"reveal\" of her past with the scarred Shining Light girl -- she lured her with ice cream and dragged her to the fighting pit, where she slashed her face -- is nothing we couldn't have put together ourselves. And once again, I wish Kimiko didn't let her get away after their fight.\n\n* That lobotomy was also very unpleasant for me to watch. It almost reminds me of the teeth-pulling scene from The Americans, but far less erotic.\n\n* It's hard to tell if this is just a throwaway scene or the beginning of something long-term, but A-Train and Ashley form an alliance after catching each other sneaking around Homelander's place. Of course, Ashley was just there to leave a floater in his toilet (on Cameron Coleman's advice) -- an offense equally punishable by death.\n\n* It's nice to see Hughie in badass mode, fighting off a Shining Light guy and killing him with a box cutter; no help from Kimiko (or temp-V) necessary. It's also pretty refreshing to see that he already knew about (and supported) Annie's abortion.\n\n* Butcher tells Hughie that he injected himself with Compound V four months ago, but it only hastened the sickness that's killing him. But we know now that it is affecting him in some way; when he blacks out in Firecracker's trailer, something inside him comes out and completely rips apart Ezekiel.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_rosenstock@vulture.com", "name": "Ben Rosenstock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Singer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Singer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inertia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_alienation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social alienation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bloom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Campbell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/11d/394/da54bc69dcb80916249aaab998949a2a24-the-boys-season-4-episode-4.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666198", "eventUri": "eng-9666198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

And this episode, as the series always tries to top itself, is probably one of the grossest to date. Yes, in terms of gore, but mainly in terms of Homelander going fully off the sadism leash in a way we have not seen before. And it's drawn a series-best performance out of Antony Starr as a result.\n\nI am not saying \"gross\" as an insult here but it's...really gross! Namely I'm referring to a sequence where Homelander forces one of his old scientist captors to attempt to masturbate in front of a room of his colleagues, threating him with laser castration if he can't do so. He can't do so. He gets laser castrated. And yes, laser castration does tend to kill you.\n\nThe entire point of this Homelander storyline in episode 4 was him dealing with his past in the most violent way possible, perhaps drawing some level of sympathy as he recounts how he was tortured and psychologically manipulated to test his power and make him subservient, but the end result is...somewhat hard to justify. He burns a man alive in the oven. There's the laser crotch blast. And things end with him tearing apart the entire rest of the staff and leaving the woman in charge alive in a room wallpapered with the gore.\n\nSo it's gross and dark and I mean, it's The Boys, that's what it does. But even for The Boys, it's pretty extreme. And going this deep into Homelander's past draws an absolutely wild performance from Antony Starr, who already should have been in Emmy contention for this part for years. This was one especially good moment during that especially sick scene:\n\nI barely even remember anything else that happened this week because of how scarring that sequence was. But I guess my biggest question is...why now? Why did Homelander wait literally decades to go and seek revenge on the scientists who absurd him as a child, needing a fractured mirror persona to inspire him to do so.\n\nI guess maybe the answer is that he hasn't been this crazy yet? Granted, he's abandoned people to die (the plane). Killed other supes. Accidentally murdered a lot of people (the ice skater most recently). And he lasered that protestor which he went to court for. But just...flat out murdering an entire room of people, most of whom he didn't even know, and leaving no bodies even intact? Yeah, it's a new level.\n\nSo it's a deeply uncomfortable watch, but it's worth it to see Starr dive down this rabbit hole.

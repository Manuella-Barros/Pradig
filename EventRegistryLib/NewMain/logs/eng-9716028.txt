His engagement with the younger kids is more limited in recent months because of his filming schedule,' the insider shared.\n\nThe source noted that the couple's custody agreement allows for visitation rights with the two minor kids.\n\n'[Angelina] has the kids most of the time, but per their agreement, he has visitation with the younger kids,' the insider added.\n\nThe actor is on location in Europe filming his new racing movie F1, while Jolie lives in Los Angeles with their younger children.\n\nIn June it was reported that Pitt is 'upset and aware' that his daughter Shiloh filed to drop his last name from her own on her 18th birthday.\n\nA source close to the Oscar winner said his erasure from his daughter's life is just another indication that he has 'lost his children,' according to People.\n\n'He's aware and upset that Shiloh dropped his last name,' the source claimed. 'He's never felt more joy than when she was born. He always wanted a daughter.'\n\nNotably, Pitt was already in the process of legally adopting a daughter who had been a part of his life for months before he and his then-partner Angelina had announced she was pregnant with Shiloh in January 2006.\n\nJolie had traveled to Ethiopia to adopt her first daughter Zahara in July 2005, and Pitt had come with her on the trip.\n\nThe former couple, who were one of Hollywood's most iconic couples before calling it quits in September 2016, are reportedly 'slowly approaching a divorce settlement' (Pitt seen in 2021)\n\nHe was reported to be in the process of becoming Zahara's adopted father in December 2005, a month before he and Jolie announced her pregnancy.\n\n'The reminders that he's lost his children, is of course not easy for Brad,' the source continued. 'He loves his children and misses them. It's very sad.'\n\nThey added that the distance between Pitt and his six children 'pains him.'\n\nHowever, they noted that 'he's still happy with Ines [de Ramon],' his current girlfriend.\n\nAnother source described as close to Pitt told the publication that the Tree Of Life star 'still loves all of his kids tremendously.'\n\n'This whole process has been very hard for the whole family,' they added.\n\nIf Shiloh's request is granted -- and there is no indication that it would not be -- she will subsequently go simply by 'Shiloh Jolie,' rather than her original full name, 'Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.'\n\nPeople previously reported that Pitt's youngest daughter Vivienne -- who served as her mother's assistant when she produced the Broadways musical adaptation of The Outsiders -- had listed her name as 'Vivienne Jolie' in the Playbill for the show.\n\nStill, a source told People that 'both sides are still talking' and their divorce negotiations are 'not done yet' (pictured in 2015)\n\nThe former Mr. and Mrs. Smith costars, who share six children, were declared legally single by a judge back in 2019 as they continue their legal battle over Ch\u00e2teau Miraval and custody of their kids\n\nIt is unclear if Vivienne has legally changed her name, but the minor would likely need either parental consent or extenuating circumstances to be allowed to do so before turning 18.\n\nLast month, Shiloh filed to drop Pitt from her last name.\n\nMeanwhile, their big sister, Zahara, previously introduced herself as 'Zahara Marley Jolie' when she joined the Mu Pi chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Spelman College late last year.\n\nPitt and Jolie's oldest sons, Maddox and Pax, have reportedly not publicly used their father's last name in years, and both have been openly antagonistic toward him.\n\nPitt and Jolie began dating publicly shortly after he and his then-wife Jennifer Aniston announced their divorce in 2005.\n\nBrad's ex, Angelina Jolie, 49, seen with their six children: twins Vivienne and Knox, 15, Pax, 20, Shiloh, 18, Zahara, 19, and Maddox, 22\n\nThe Mr. And Mrs. Smith costars remained unmarried for years despite having multiple adopted and biological children together, but they got engaged in 2012 and finally tied the knot in 2014.\n\nHowever, it was only around two years later when the Maleficent actress filed for divorce in 2016. She and Pitt were declared legally single in 2019.\n\nHowever, the two A-listers have been embroiled in an ongoing divorce battle over assets and custody for years since.\n\nIn June it was reported that Pitt is 'upset and aware' that his daughter Shiloh filed to drop his last name from her own on her 18th birthday; Angelina Jolie (Center) pictured with daughters Zahara (L) and Shiloh (R) in 2021 in Rome\n\nPitt's youngest daughter Vivienne, also dropped the last name Pitt from her moniker in The Outsiders Playbill in May; Angelina and Vivienne pictured on April 11\n\nA central issue seems to be a notorious private jet confrontation in 2016.\n\nAn FBI report on the incident, which was published in 2022, saw Jolie accuse Pitt of physical assault while flying to California in 2016. She claimed that he was intoxicated and that he grabbed her by the head and shook her, and later pushed her down, as part of a confrontation allegedly related to their children.\n\nJolie told the FBI that Pitt told the children that she was 'f***ing up this family,' and she said he punched the ceiling of the airplane four times.\n\nShe claimed that at one point he poured beer on her and a blanket she was under with multiple children.\n\nSources close to Pitt later claimed that he never hit any of the children, though they admitted that he had been drinking.", "source": {"uri":

It allows them to remarry -- should they find partners -- while still battling over their shared assets, child custody, and other divorce-related issues. The ex-couple, who share six children (Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15) have yet to commit to a balanced custody arrangement.

They also have three adopted children, sons Maddox, 22, and Pax, 20, as well as daughter Zahara, 19.\n\nThe source noted that the couple's custody agreement allows for visitation rights with the two minor kids.\n\n'[Angelina] has the kids most of the time, but per their agreement, he has visitation with the younger kids,' the insider added.\n\nThe actor is on location in Europe filming his new racing movie F1, while Jolie lives in Los Angeles with their younger children.\n\nIn June it was reported that Pitt is 'upset and aware' that his daughter Shiloh filed to drop his last name from her own on her 18th birthday.\n\nA source close to the Oscar winner said his erasure from his daughter's life is just another indication that he has 'lost his children,' according to People.\n\n'He's aware and upset that Shiloh dropped his last name,' the source claimed. 'He's never felt more joy than when she was born. He always wanted a daughter.'\n\nNotably, Pitt was already in the process of legally adopting a daughter who had been a part of his life for months before he and his then-partner Angelina had announced she was pregnant with Shiloh in January 2006.\n\nJolie had traveled to Ethiopia to adopt her first daughter Zahara in July 2005, and Pitt had come with her on the trip.\n\nHe was reported to be in the process of becoming Zahara's adopted father in December 2005, a month before he and Jolie announced her pregnancy.\n\n'The reminders that he's lost his children, is of course not easy for Brad,' the source continued. 'He loves his children and misses them. It's very sad.'\n\nThey added that the distance between Pitt and his six children 'pains him.'\n\nHowever, they noted that 'he's still happy with Ines [de Ramon],' his current girlfriend.\n\nAnother source described as close to Pitt told the publication that the Tree Of Life star 'still loves all of his kids tremendously.'\n\n'This whole process has been very hard for the whole family,' they added.\n\nIf Shiloh's request is granted -- and there is no indication that it would not be -- she will subsequently go simply by 'Shiloh Jolie,' rather than her original full name, 'Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.'\n\nPeople previously reported that Pitt's youngest daughter Vivienne -- who served as her mother's assistant when she produced the Broadways musical adaptation of The Outsiders -- had listed her name as 'Vivienne Jolie' in the Playbill for the show.\n\nIt is unclear if Vivienne has legally changed her name, but the minor would likely need either parental consent or extenuating circumstances to be allowed to do so before turning 18.\n\nZahara previously introduced herself as 'Zahara Marley Jolie' when she joined the Mu Pi chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Spelman College late last year.\n\nPitt and Jolie's oldest sons, Maddox and Pax, have reportedly not publicly used their father's last name in years, and both have been openly antagonistic toward him.\n\nPitt and Jolie began dating publicly shortly after he and his then-wife Jennifer Aniston announced their divorce in 2005.\n\nThe Mr. And Mrs. Smith costars remained unmarried for years despite having multiple adopted and biological children together, but they got engaged in 2012 and finally tied the knot in 2014.\n\nHowever, it was only around two years later when the Maleficent actress filed for divorce in 2016. She and Pitt were declared legally single in 2019.\n\nHowever, the two A-listers have been embroiled in an ongoing divorce battle over assets and custody for years since.\n\nA central issue seems to be a notorious private jet confrontation in 2016.\n\nAn FBI report on the incident, which was published in 2022, saw Jolie accuse Pitt of physical assault while flying to California in 2016. She claimed that he was intoxicated and that he grabbed her by the head and shook her, and later pushed her down, as part of a confrontation allegedly related to their children.\n\nJolie told the FBI that Pitt told the children that she was 'f***ing up this family,' and she said he punched the ceiling of the airplane four times.\n\nShe claimed that at one point he poured beer on her and a blanket she was under with multiple children.\n\nSource close to Pitt later claimed that he never hit any of the children, though they admitted that he had been drinking.", "source": {"uri":

Brad Pitt responded in typical fashion, with a strategic leak from \"a source close to Brad.\" The source huffed to People: \"He's aware and upset that Shiloh dropped his last name. He's never felt more joy than when she was born. He always wanted a daughter.\" As we noted at the time, Shiloh is his second daughter. He was already father to a daughter before Shiloh was born: Zahara was adopted by Brad and Angelina in 2005. Shiloh was born in 2006.\n\nAnyway, the point is that Brad is a terrible father and we know for a fact that five out of six kids want nothing to do with him. Maddox and Pax despise him. Shiloh hired her own lawyer to remove \"Pitt\" from her name. Zahara and Vivienne have both dropped Pitt from their names at school and in Broadway playbills. Knox is the only question mark, but it's more than likely that Knox feels the same way and he's just quieter about it. Well, Knox and Vivienne are about to turn 16 years old, meaning they are the only two kids left who are part of a custodial arrangement between their parents. This is what \"sources close to Brad\" are hanging their hats on - the two youngest kids are required to \"engage\" with him to some degree, before they turn 18 years old and cut him out of their lives too, I guess.\n\nOne month after Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's 18-year-old daughter Shiloh filed to drop \"Pitt\" from her last name, a source close to the family tells PEOPLE that the actor has \"virtually no contact\" with his adult kids but still has visitation with his younger kids.\n\n\"He has virtually no contact with the adult kids. His engagement with the younger kids is more limited in recent months because of his filming schedule,\" the source says. Pitt is currently on location in Europe filming his upcoming racing movie F1.\n\nJolie, 48, and Pitt, 60, share six kids: Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, Pax, 20, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15. The source also notes that the couple's custody agreement allows visitation rights to their minor children.\n\n\"[Angelina] has the kids most of the time, but per their agreement, he has visitation with the younger kids.\"\n\nA source close to Pitt recently revealed to PEOPLE that the father of six is \"aware and upset\" about Shiloh's name change. \"He's aware and upset that Shiloh dropped his last name,\" the source said in June.\n\n\"The reminders that he's lost his children, is of course not easy for Brad. He loves his children and misses them. It's very sad,\" added the insider.\n\n\"He's still happy with Ines [de Ramon],\" the source continued, but the distance from his children \"pains him.\"\n\n\"He still loves all of his kids tremendously,\" another source close to Pitt told PEOPLE. \"This whole process has been very hard for the whole family.\"\n\n[From People]\n\n\"He has virtually no contact with the adult kids\" - I guess we're now including Shiloh with the \"adult kids.\" Which is funny because he's spent years spreading lies about how he and Shiloh are tight and they have a good relationship. Guess not! Anyway, I don't know why Brad and his team keep trying to \"manage\" this story, because they cannot massage it in any positive way. Brad Pitt's children hate him. They hate him because he terrorized them and hurt their mother. He's still using the legal system to abuse their mother and the kids see that too.

He loves his children and misses them. It's very sad.\"\n\nThe insider added: \"He still loves all of his kids tremendously. This whole process has been very hard for the whole family.\"\n\nWhile Pitt is \"still happy with [girlfriend] Ines [de Ramon],\" the fractured relationship with his children \"pains him,\" the source told People.\n\nAlmost in an illustration of this point, Pitt spent Sunday, July 7, at the 2024 British Grand Prix with de Ramon, whom he has been linked to since 2022.

The most recent headlines were about Shiloh dropping \"Pitt\" from her legal name, and Zahara and Vivienne doing the same in their private lives. With all of that personal and legal drama though, it's easy to forget that Angelina is having a great year professionally. She just won a Tony Award as a producer on The Outsiders. She wrapped on Pablo Larrain's Maria - a Maria Callas bio-pic - last year, and there are tons of rumors that Maria will premiere at the Venice Film Festival, and that Angelina will be part of an Oscar campaign.

The Oscar-winning actress recently came off of an exciting night at the 2024 Tony Awards, where her new Broadway show The Outsiders nabbed best new musical, among other awards. The show is a family affair for Jolie, 49, who served as co-producer on the musical alongside her 15-year-old daughter Vivienne, who assisted on the production.\n\n\"Angie seems very happy and content with her life,\" a source close to Jolie tells PEOPLE. \"She's focused on her kids and work. She's involved in projects that she truly cares and feels passionate about.\"\n\nAdds the insider of Jolie (who also shares daughters Zahara, 19, and Shiloh, 18, plus sons Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, and Knox, 15, with ex Brad Pitt), \"She's very proud of her kids.\"\n\n[From People]\n\nI hope she is happy and content - after years of legal shenanigans, she seems to have a good team of lawyers helping her deal with all of Brad's bullsh-t. Atelier Jolie is up and running, although I still think she should hire some managers and money people. And who knows, Maria could be a huge step in the Jolie-as-Actress renaissance. Her kids are getting older and she can travel more for work... come on, Angelina, take more acting gigs!\n\nAngelina was also out with Knox over the weekend - he's now taller than his mom.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maria Callas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_Miraval,_Correns-Var", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, Correns-Var"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards_and_Bestsellers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards and Bestsellers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716028", "eventUri": "eng-9716028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The actors, who shared the screen in 2005's Mr. and Mrs. Smith as well as 2015's By the Sea, were declared legally single by a judge back in 2019.\n\nThe exes have six kids together: Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Pax, 20, Shiloh, 18, and twins Knox and Vivienne, who turn 16 on July 12.\n\nA source recently told PEOPLE that Pitt, 60, has \"virtually no contact\" with their adult children, but per his agreement with Jolie, \"he has visitation with the younger kids.\" In recent months, his interaction with the younger children has been more limited because of his filming schedule.

I heard one lawyer say, 'No one wins in court -- it's just a matter of who gets hurt worse.'

The exes were married in Aug. 2014 and divorced in April 2019, following Pitt's alleged airplane abuse in 2016. Since then, they have had numerous public spats over the years, including recently when the Fight Club star seemingly snubbed his daughter Zahara, 19, in a response to his daughter Shiloh, 18, dropping \"Pitt\" from her last name.

An insider told In Touch that the 60-year-old hopes to have kids with his girlfriend Ines de Ramon. \"Brad wants another chance at fatherhood,\" they told the outlet. \"He's a different person than the first time around.\"\n\nUntil then, he's supposedly trying to get close to his kids with Jolie again. \"He's tried to rebuild relationships with all his children, and will continue to try,\" they continued. \"He hopes things will change over time when the kids are not so heavily influenced by Angelina.\"", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydni_ellis@sheknows.com", "name": "Sydni Ellis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fight Club (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maleficent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl,_Interrupted", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girl, Interrupted"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2157334681-1-e1720555833454.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716028", "eventUri": "eng-9716028", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-", "textStart": 95, "textEnd": 104}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 121, "textEnd": 131}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

We have to do this. We have to go through this.' \"\n\nAt that time, the Girl, Interrupted star commented on her daughter, saying, \"She's been a really tough assistant.\"\n\n\"She takes it very, very seriously.\"\n\nJolie and Vivienne were also seen together in Los Angeles on May 30, attending the opening night of Reefer Madness: The Musical.

The outing provided a glimpse into their family life, with Knox opting for a casual look of a T-shirt, athletic shorts, and Nike sneakers, while Angelina wore a white low-cut shirt, black blazer, matching pants, and heeled boots.\n\nWhile Knox typically maintains a low profile, his twin sister Vivienne has embraced the limelight, recently assisting Angelina on Broadway and accompanying her to prestigious events like the Tony Awards.\n\nIn a notable move reflecting their independence, Zahara and Vivienne have recently dropped Pitt from their last names, a decision Shiloh also made upon turning 18 in May 2024. These changes underscore the evolving dynamics within the Jolie-Pitt family following Angelina and Brad's highly publicized divorce, which was finalized in March this year, granting Angelina full custody of their children.\n\nAngelina has since focused on her children's wellbeing, emphasizing the importance of their healing in interviews, including with Vogue India. Her commitment to her family remains steadfast as she navigates the challenges and joys of parenthood in the public eye.\n\nThe Jolie-Pitt children continue to make headlines not just for their family's Hollywood ties but also for their individual pursuits and decisions, ensuring their legacy in both entertainment and personal identity remains diverse and multifaceted.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Angelina County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Identity (social science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/angelina-21698904714-2/angelina-21698904714-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716028", "eventUri": "eng-9716028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The teenager reportedly listed her name as \"Vivienne Jolie\" instead of \"Vivienne Jolie-Pitt\" in the Playbill for a musical, which hints that she might also have a strained relationship with her father.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Pitt has found solace in the arms of his girlfriend, Ines de Ramon, despite his troubles with his ex-wife and children.\n\nThe duo was first spotted together in November 2022, though it was later revealed that they had been a couple for several months before that appearance.\n\nAccording to an insider, the jewelry executive makes Pitt feel like he's \"on top of the world again.\" The two have also moved in together to strengthen their blossoming relationship.\n\nThe source said about the couple, \"He is happy to live with her too. They were spending a lot of time at Brad's. It only made sense for her to move in. Their relationship is serious.\"\n\nThey added, \"This is Brad's first girlfriend since the divorce.

Just as they have seemed to purge Pitt from their lives.\n\nDespite a clear PR campaign to make it appear otherwise, this was not Angelina Jolie's doing.\n\nA new report shines light on how the Jolie children, as adults, could come out with a tell-all. That could be Brad Pitt's \"worst nightmare\".\n\nMost of the Jolie kids have not made public statements in the wake of the 2016 flight on which Brad Pitt allegedly abused Angelina Jolie and more than one of their children.\n\nMaddox testified against him during the protracted winery-related court battle that some accuse Pitt of waging simply to exert control over Jolie. Pax blasted his dad in a once-private Father's Day post.\n\nMore recently, some of their siblings have dropped \"Pitt\" from their last names. This includes Shiloh, who filed to legally change her surname on her birthday -- despite months of anonymous claims that she was Team Brad.\n\nNone of that is the same as sitting down with a journalist or penning a memoir. That would mean discussing, in detail, exactly why you've purged your father from your life.\n\nAccording to a new report by In Touch Weekly, Brad Pitt feels terrified that his children will one day give a tell-all interview.

At the time, Zahara introduced herself as \"Zahara Marley Jolie\" when she officially joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Spelman College. Vivienne followed suit in May when she was listed on The Outsiders' Broadway playbill as \"Vivienne Jolie.\"\n\nWhen Shiloh turned 18 on May 27, she filed to legally change her name to \"Shiloh Jolie,\" according to court paperwork obtained by TMZ.\n\n\"If these kids eventually do want to turn around and get the ultimate closure by laying it all out in the open and telling the world what they've been through, it's going to be Brad's worst nightmare and no doubt will be the ultimate humiliation for him,\" the source concludes. \"He's in a very tough spot because it's not like he can even try and talk to them about it because that could only make things worse.

The actress recently stunned fans at the Tony Awards on June 16 with her exceedingly slender figure. She donned a strapless ruched gown that exposed her slender shoulders and arms, as reported by Radar Online.\n\nPeople close to Jolie are encouraging her to eat well to stay healthy, particularly considering her hectic schedule as a professional actress and a devoted mother to six children. An insider revealed, \"She's looking very thin, almost sickly, and probably doesn't weigh more than 98 pounds. She's either forgetting or unwilling to eat. Pals are afraid she won't be able to carry on like this.\" Sources also let InTouch Weekly know what Jolie thinks about her weight loss.\n\nOne shared, \"Angie knows she's super skinny...She also knows that if she wears a revealing dress, everyone is going to talk about how she looks. She practically invites people to comment on her weight by wearing gowns like this that make her look so slim. It's almost as if she's starving for attention.\" Others however opined that the stress of her continuing custody struggle has been too much for her.\n\nAn insider disclosed, \"This war with Brad Pitt -- especially the custody battle over their kids [Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15] -- has really taken a toll. When Angie is stressed out, she doesn't eat. That's not good when she's already so skinny. She was probably also nervous about the Tonys, because The Outsiders, which she produced, was up for Best Musical. She really wanted to win and was so focused on that. She's the type that forgets to eat.\"\n\nJolie is currently embroiled in a contentious court battle with her ex-husband Brad Pitt, over the sale of her portion of the Ch\u00e2teau Miraval vineyard. In 2022, Pitt sued Jolie, claiming that she had violated her 'contractural rights' by selling her share of the property without his knowledge. In their countersuit, Jolie's attorneys asserted that talks between Pitt's team and her regarding the sale of her stake in the company came to a halt when Pitt allegedly insisted that she sign \"a nondisclosure agreement that would have contractually prohibited her from speaking outside of court about Pitt's physical and emotional abuse of her and their children.\"\n\nAs reported by CNN, her legal team filed a fresh request in April, claiming that letters between Pitt and Jolie show he refused to sell her vineyard part unless she signed a 'more onerous' and 'expansive' NDA. They also revealed new information on the purported fight that took place in September 2016 on an airplane. They alleged that Pitt 'grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her\" and \"choked one of the children and struck another in the face.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Online", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar Online"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_Miraval,_Correns-Var", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, Correns-Var"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Award for Best Musical"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vineyard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/703930/uploads/67db8d50-3d29-11ef-916e-adff64e9266f_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716028", "eventUri": "eng-9716028", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 227}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 2703, "textEnd": 2717}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This comes months after Pitt's daughter Shiloh legally dropped \"Pitt\" from her name on her 18th birthday, a decision that reportedly saddened the actor. \"He's aware and upset that Shiloh dropped his last name,\" a source revealed in June. This event has sparked questions about potential name changes within the family as Vivienne's (15) recent credit in a musical production Playbill omitted \"Pitt.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l36720240710140354.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716028", "eventUri": "eng-9716028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

From a young age, Knox has been the spitting image of Brad, showcasing features that are unmistakably inherited from his dad.\n\nThe power couple, affectionately dubbed \"Brangelina,\" met in 2004 on the set of their blockbuster hit Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\n\nAfter years of speculation and anticipation, they tied the knot in a private ceremony in 2014. However, their union came to an end in 2016, leading to a prolonged custody battle that concluded in March 2024. Angelina was granted full custody, with Brad receiving visitation rights.\n\nIn a heartwarming throwback to August 30, 2015, E! News shared an adorable photo of Brad and a then 7-year-old Knox at the British Grand Prix.\n\nThe image, posted on social media, prompted fans to debate who Knox resembled more, with many agreeing that he was a \"perfect mix\" of both parents. This wasn't an isolated incident; Knox has continually mirrored Brad's looks over the years.\n\nOne memorable moment was in December 2010, when the Jolie-Pitts were seen entering Lee's Art Shop in New York City. Brad, sporting his signature cap, walked alongside a young Knox, who donned a winter hat reminiscent of a Scally cap. The black hats and their strikingly similar expressions made it clear that Knox was Brad's mini-me.\n\nFast forward to September 14, 2017, Knox, then 9, attended the New York Premiere of Angelina's directorial project, First They Killed My Father, at the DGA Theater. Dressed to the nines in a black blazer and pants, with a white shirt and a flower lapel pin, Knox's half-smirk was undeniably inherited from Brad.\n\nBrad himself showcased a similar expression at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester Square, London, for the premiere of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood on July 30, 2019.\n\nDressed in a sharp navy suit and matching shirt, Brad's unbuttoned collar mirrored his son's relaxed style. Their shared smirk and piercing eyes left no doubt about their familial bond.\n\nIn July 2024, Knox and Angelina were seen leaving a grocery store, with Knox carrying the shopping bags. The young man, towering over his glamorous mother, was dressed casually in a grey T-shirt, shorts, and Nike high tops.\n\nOn the same day, Brad was photographed at the British Grand Prix with his girlfriend, Ines de Ramon. The father-son duo's striking resemblance was once again evident, even as they went about their separate activities.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercouple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercouple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._&_Mrs._Smith_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mr. & Mrs. Smith (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E!

The A-lister completed the look with a black purse, matching sneakers and a low ponytail.\n\nVivienne, 15, rocked a monochromatic ensemble that featured a loose beige T-shirt and matching pants that were cuffed at the bottom, exposing her black and white Converse.\n\nThe duo have been a force to be reckoned with after Angie co-produced The Outsiders musical with Vivienne as her assistant, which premiered on Broadway in April. Although the project was a huge deal for the pair, Vivienne made headlines after playgoers noticed that she was listed as \"Vivienne Jolie\" in the Playbill.\n\nNeither the celebrity teen nor her parents have publicly addressed the name change and it's unknown if Vivienne legally dropped \"Pitt\" from her name.\n\nHowever, in May, Vivienne's older sister Shiloh, who had just turned 18 at the time, filed paperwork to legally change her name to \"Shiloh Pitt.\"\n\n\"Brad was blindsided by Shiloh dropping his last name, but he wasn't surprised. He feels that Angie has slowly but surely turned their kids against him,\" an insider exclusively told In Touch at the time. \"She absolutely influenced their decisions to distance themselves from their dad.\"\n\nOne month prior, a separate source exclusively told In Touch that two of his kids visited him at his house.\n\n\"Brad cherishes time with his kids and loves seeing them when he can, when he's in town, once or twice a week,\" the source said of the January reunion. \"It's definitely something he prioritizes.\"\n\nAngie and Brad, 60, are still battling out their 2016 divorce in court as they fight for custody of their remaining two minor kids, Vivienne and Knox.\n\nBefore joining their staff crew onstage, Angie and Viv walked the red carpet in matching ensembles. The Eternals actress wore a sea-like emerald strapless wrap dress that featured a mini shawl. Vivienne styled herself in a different look as she sported a teal vest suit and bowtie with Converse.\n\nVivienne became fascinated with the play after she watched it at La Jolla Playhouse in 2023. After watching it several times, she took her mom to watch the magic at the San Diego-based theater.\n\n\"After we saw it, we were contacted by the producers, and they said, did you enjoy it, and we said yes, and they said, 'What did you like?' So, Viv and I sat together and we wrote down what we liked, what we were curious about,\" Angie told Deadline in June. \"And they responded to our notes.

Last year, the state enacted legislation to create the Texas Business Court, a venue for business cases involving more than $5 million, creating an alternative to the corporate law hotspots established in New York and in Delaware.\n\nThe latter remains by far the state of choice for large companies. But Delaware's statute was targeted by Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive whose $56 billion stock compensation plan was challenged in a Delaware state court.\n\nThe Texas Stock Exchange faces an uphill battle to compete with the NYSE and Nasdaq, the two largest players in the U.S. stock market.

Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) aims to challenge the regulatory environment of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq.\n\nThis move seeks to capitalize on rising dissatisfaction with compliance costs at the Nasdaq and NYSE, offering a more CEO-friendly environment.\n\nDespite the dominance of NYSE and Nasdaq in US corporate stock listings, TXSE's backers, including Citadel Securities and BlackRock, provide significant support. These firms have previously supported other upstart exchanges, like Members Exchange (MEMX).\n\nA Citadel spokesperson confirmed that the company is an investor in TXSE. Furthermore, James H. Lee, Chairman and CEO of TXSE, has also confirmed both firms' involvement in this project in his LinkedIn post.\n\nRead more: The 7 Hottest Blockchain Stocks to Watch in 2024\n\n\"We are thankful for the support of our more than two dozen investors, including some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world, such as BlackRock and Citadel Securities, as well as prominent business leaders from around the country. With approximately $120 million of capital raised, TXSE is expected to be the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to file a registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,\" Lee wrote.\n\nTXSE has secured approximately $120 million from investors. It also plans to file registration documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later this year. Operations are expected to start in 2025, with the first listing planned in 2026.\n\nThe exchange will be entirely electronic but physically present in Dallas. It also aims to compete for primary and dual listings, including exchange-traded products.\n\nTexas has been actively seeking to attract more financial business, and establishing Texas Business Courts as an alternative to the Delaware Court of Chancery system highlights the state's growing importance.\n\nFor instance, Tesla is considering moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas following a controversial court ruling. This development could further enhance Texas's reputation as a major financial center.\n\n\"Texas's booming economy and the strong economic and population growth among states in the southeast quadrant of the US present incredible opportunities for businesses -- and ultimately the TXSE,\" Lee opined.\n\nThe crypto community enthusiastically welcomed this latest development, particularly given that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed his optimism about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the potential of tokenizations. Following the iShares Bitcoin ETF launch in January, Fink emphasized the potential of ETFs to revolutionize all financial instruments.\n\nHe discussed a major architectural change at BlackRock, integrating iShares's ethos and philosophy into the entire company. This reflects their belief that the ETF revolution is only halfway complete.\n\nFink drew parallels between ETFs and Bitcoin as technologies for asset storage. He envisioned every stock and bond having its own unique identifier on a general ledger, allowing for individualized investor identification and eliminating issues related to illicit activities.\n\nRead more: What is Tokenization on Blockchain?", "source": {"uri": "beincrypto.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BeInCrypto"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lynn_wang@beincrypto.com", "name":

Picture: REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID\n\nBengaluru/New York -- TXSE Group, backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities, plans to launch Texas Stock Exchange in Dallas, going up against established New York-centric exchanges in a bid to attract global companies.\n\nThe exchange, which has raised about $120m, plans to file registration documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to start operating as a national securities exchange later this year, TXSE said on Wednesday.\n\nA rebound in capital markets has sent a plethora of companies from within and outside the US scrambling to list their stocks, creating more opportunity for indices.\n\nBut carving a space could be difficult for a new exchange in the lucrative US listings market, where the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq have dominated in a virtual duopoly since the 2000s.\n\nMajor regional stock exchanges such as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, and the Chicago Stock Exchange, merged into either the Nasdaq or the NYSE, diminishing competition, after the SEC introduced laws that gave preference to automated trading platforms.\n\nTrading volumes, a key measure of strength of exchanges, have also been concentrated between the two industry giants, which make it difficult for exchanges with low volume activity to draw big orders from traders.\n\nBut changes in equities trading markets, such as a shift in listing standards and associated costs, are driving more volumes to exchanges and more choices for issuers and sponsors, said James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE.\n\nCorporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs, the company said.\n\nThe Texas stock exchange aims to attract listings of exchange-traded products and challenge increasing compliance costs at major US indices, as well as newer rules including setting targets for board diversity at the Nasdaq, as per a report from the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.\n\n\"TXSE will ultimately create more competition around quote activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets,\" Lee added.\n\nTexas has been at the forefront of politically \"red\" states that restricted their public pension funds from doing business with BlackRock and other Wall Street firms that have embraced environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles.\n\nWith the growing prominence of sustainable investing, existing exchange operators have increased their focus on ESG business opportunities and are increasingly rolling out new initiatives.\n\nComplicated relationship\n\nBlackRock has had a complicated relationship with the officials of the Republican-leaning state of Texas in recent years.\n\nThe company, which is a major investor in oil companies such as Exxon and has rejected calls to divest fossil fuel holdings, faces accusations of \"boycotting\" certain industries due to its call for wider emission disclosures from its portfolio companies.\n\nIn February CEO Larry Fink appeared with Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick at an event in Houston to stoke infrastructure investments. But the next month, a state fund withdrew $8.5bn from BlackRock's management, citing the company's energy policies.\n\n\"BlackRock is proud to be a founding investor in the Texas Stock Exchange to increase liquidity and improve market efficiency for clients and other investors in the US capital markets,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nBefore Texas Stock Exchange, Citadel Securities has backed some exchanges focused on different assets such as Members Exchange (MEMX) in equities and options, FMX Futures Exchange and EDX Markets in crypto.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za",

And it's already lined up around $120 million in funding from BlackRock, Citadel Securities, and other investors including \"prominent business leaders from around the country.\"\n\nTXSE Group announced today that it plans to launch the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), focusing on enabling U.S. and global companies to access U.S. equity capital markets. The group says it will provide \"a venue to trade and list public companies and the growing universe of exchange-traded products\" as a \"fully electronic, national securities exchange\" that will seek registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nPlanning a \"more CEO-friendly\" exchange with less regulation and diversity rules\n\nThe Wall Street Journal broke the news of the planned launch on Tuesday, noting that the TXSE Group is \"aiming to take on what they see as onerous regulation at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,\" with a goal to begin handling trades in 2025 and to host its first listing in 2026.\n\nThe WSJ said the Texas Stock Exchange plans to leverage dismay at rising compliance costs at the NYSE and Nasdaq -- as well as frustration with rules like the Nasdaq's board diversity requirements.\n\nAiming for 'more consistent and reliable markets'\n\n\"Changes in equities trading markets are driving more volume to exchanges and more choices for issuers and sponsors,\" James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group, said in a statement. \"TXSE will ultimately create more competition around quote activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets that benefit investors, global issuers, and liquidity providers alike.\"\n\nTXSE Group said the planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide \"an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition.\"\n\n\"Corporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs,\" the group said. \"TXSE intends to expand access to U.S. capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\"\n\n\"We're thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\" Lee said. \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we're seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\"\n\nThe TXSE Group noted that Texas and the states in the nation's southeast quadrant lead the nation in economic expansion and population growth, \"making Texas the clear choice for the establishment of a new national securities exchange.\" For decades, Texas has been the nation's leader in attracting business relocations and expansions, the group added, as well as being home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state and more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies, \"many of which are preparing to access the public markets.\"\n\nNorth Texas bristles with Fortune 500 companies\n\nOf course, a lot of those Fortune 500 companies are headquartered right here in North Texas, including AT&T, American Airlines, McKesson, Energy Transfer, Caterpillar, Kimberly-Clark, D.R. Horton, Southwest Airlines, Jacobs Engineering, Celanese, Tenet Healthcare, and more.\n\nThe TXSE Group also noted that there are more than 1,500 publicly traded companies throughout the region it's targeting.\n\nThe group said it intends to submit a registration with the SEC to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\nMore on the $120M capital raise\n\nMore than two dozen investors took part in the group's capital raise, TXE Group said, \"including some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world.\" The group said its liquidity providers \"represent a significant portion of the equity volume on U.S. lit exchanges and together comprise a majority of all U.S. listed retail volume.\"\n\nThe group said that with the $120 million raised, the Texas Stock Exchange is \"expected to be the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to file a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\"\n\nHouston-based WoodRock Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent for TXSE Group Inc. in the capital raise.

And it has already lined up about $120 million in funding from BlackRock, Citadel Securities and other investors, including \"prominent business leaders from across the country.\"\n\nTXSE Group today announced plans to launch the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), aimed in part at providing U.S. and global companies access to U.S. capital markets. The group says it will provide \"a venue to trade and list public companies and the growing universe of exchange-traded products\" as a \"fully electronic national securities exchange\" that will apply for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission the United States.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal announced the news of the launch scheduled for Tuesday, noting that the TXSE Group \"aims to take on what it considers onerous regulation at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq\", with the aim of starting to manage transactions in 2025 and to organize its first listing in 2025. 2026.\n\nThe WSJ said the Texas Stock Exchange plans to take advantage of dismay over rising compliance costs at the NYSE and Nasdaq, as well as frustration with rules such as Nasdaq's. board diversity requirements.\n\n\"Changes in the securities markets are generating more trading volumes and more choices for issuers and sponsors.\" James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group, said in a statement. \"The TXSE will ultimately create more competition around listing activities, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets that will benefit both investors, global issuers and liquidity providers. \"\n\nTXSE Group said the planned launch comes as changes in the stock markets provide \"an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition.\"\n\n\"Issuing companies and sponsors of exchange-traded products are demanding more stability and predictability with respect to listing standards and associated costs,\" the group said. \"TXSE intends to expand access to the U.S. capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment to public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\"\n\nThe TXSE aims to launch with a focus on the southeastern United States, which it defines as Texas,Alabama,Arkansas,Florida,Georgia,Louisiana,Mississippi,North Carolina,Oklahoma,Caroline from the southAndTennessee.\n\n\"We are delighted to realize the long-held vision of a national stock exchange inTexas\", Lee said. \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant became economic powers. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and businesses for expanded alternatives to trading and listing stocks, this is an opportune time to build a major national exchange in Texas.\"\n\nThe TXSE group noted that Texas and states in the southeastern quadrant of the country lead the country in economic expansion and population growth, \"making Texas the clear choice for the creation of a new national securities exchange. For decades, Texas has led the nation in attracting corporate relocations and expansions, the group added, in addition to hosting more Fortune 500 companies than any other state and more than 5,200 fund-sponsored companies private equity firms, \"many of which are preparing to access the public market.\" markets. \"\n\nOf course, many of these Fortune 500 companies are headquartered right here in North Texas, including AT&T, American Airlines, McKesson, Energy Transfer, Caterpillar, Kimberly-Clark, DR Horton, Southwest Airlines, Jacobs Engineering, Celanese, Tenet Healthcare and more.\n\nTXSE Group also noted that there are more than 1,500 publicly traded companies in the region it is targeting.\n\nThe group said it intends to submit registration with the SEC to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\nMore than twenty investors participated in the group's capital increase, said TXE Group, \"including some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world.\" The group said its liquidity providers \"account for a significant portion of equity volume on U.S. exchanges and together account for the majority of all U.S.-listed retail volumes.\"\n\nThe group said that with the $120 million raised, the Texas Stock Exchange \"is expected to be the most well-capitalized securities player to file for registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\"\n\nHouston-based WoodRock Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent to TXSE Group Inc. in connection with the capital raise.

Gov. Dan Patrick at an event in Houston to stoke infrastructure investments. But the next month, a state fund withdrew $8.5 billion from BlackRock's management, citing the company's energy policies.\n\n\"BlackRock is proud to be a founding investor in the Texas Stock Exchange to increase liquidity and improve market efficiency for clients and other investors in the U.S. capital markets,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nPrior to the Texas Stock Exchange, Citadel Securities

We look forward to engaging with the other investors on the benefits of the TXSE's unique value proposition.\"\n\nCitadel Securities had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing.\n\nTexas has been noted by market participants as an increasingly significant market in North America and globally, playing host to around 5000 private equity-backed firms and 1500 publicly listed firms.\n\nIn an update on social media on Tuesday, chair and chief executive at TXSE James Lee, said: \"We are thankful for the support of our more than two dozen investors, including some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world, such as BlackRock and Citadel Securities, as well as prominent business leaders from around the country.\"\n\n\"With approximately $120 million of capital raised, TXSE is expected to be the most well-capitalised exchange entrant to file a registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\"", "source": {"uri": "thetradenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The TRADE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wesley_bray@thetradenews.com", "name": "Wesley Bray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Members Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Groupware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Groupware", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.thetradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iStock-923519778-300x200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625670", "eventUri": "eng-9625670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

And it's already lined up around $120 million in funding from BlackRock, Citadel Securities, and other investors including \"prominent business leaders from around the country.\"\n\nTXSE Group announced today that it plans to launch the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), focusing on enabling U.S. and global companies to access U.S. equity capital markets. The group says it will provide \"a venue to trade and list public companies and the growing universe of exchange-traded products\" as a \"fully electronic, national securities exchange\" that will seek registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal broke the news of the planned launch on Tuesday, noting that the TXSE Group is \"aiming to take on what they see as onerous regulation at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,\" with a goal to begin handling trades in 2025 and to host its first listing in 2026.\n\nThe WSJ said the Texas Stock Exchange plans to leverage dismay at rising compliance costs at the NYSE and Nasdaq -- as well as frustration with rules like the Nasdaq's board diversity requirements.\n\n\"Changes in equities trading markets are driving more volume to exchanges and more choices for issuers and sponsors,\" James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group, said in a statement. \"TXSE will ultimately create more competition around quote activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets that benefit investors, global issuers, and liquidity providers alike.\"\n\nTXSE Group said the planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide \"an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition.\"\n\n\"Corporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs,\" the group said. \"TXSE intends to expand access to U.S. capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\"\n\nThe TXSE aims to launch with a focus on the Southeast U.S. -- which it defines as Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\n\"We're thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\" Lee said. \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we're seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\"\n\nThe TXSE Group noted that Texas and the states in the nation's southeast quadrant lead the nation in economic expansion and population growth, \"making Texas the clear choice for the establishment of a new national securities exchange.\" For decades, Texas has been the nation's leader in attracting business relocations and expansions, the group added, as well as being home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state and more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies, \"many of which are preparing to access the public markets.\"\n\nOf course, a lot of those Fortune 500 companies are headquartered right here in North Texas, including AT&T, American Airlines, McKesson, Energy Transfer, Caterpillar, Kimberly-Clark, D.R. Horton, Southwest Airlines, Jacobs Engineering, Celanese, Tenet Healthcare, and more.\n\nThe TXSE Group also noted that there are more than 1,500 publicly traded companies throughout the region it's targeting.\n\nThe group said it intends to submit a registration with the SEC to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\nMore than two dozen investors took part in the group's capital raise, TXE Group said, \"including some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world.\" The group said its liquidity providers \"represent a significant portion of the equity volume on U.S. lit exchanges and together comprise a majority of all U.S. listed retail volume.\"\n\nThe group said that with the $120 million raised, the Texas Stock Exchange is \"expected to be the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to file a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\"\n\nHouston-based WoodRock Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent for TXSE Group Inc. in the capital raise. Washington, D.C.-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore serves as regulatory counsel to the Texas Stock Exchange. The Dallas office of Haynes and Boone LLP served as counsel to TXSE Group Inc. in the offering and will serve as corporate counsel. PwC Consulting serves as managed services provider for TXSE Group Inc.\n\nSign up to keep your eye on what's new and next in Dallas-Fort Worth, every day.", "source": {"uri": "s24806.pcdn.co",

The aim is to start facilitating trading in 2025 and organize its first listing in 2026.\n\nThe exchange aims to exploit the disaffection with rising compliance costs at Nasdaq and the NYSE and newer rules, such as one setting diversity goals on the Nasdaq board. Supporters of the TXSE, as it is called, are committed to making it more CEO-friendly.\n\nThe move also reflects the changing landscape of U.S. business, with dozens of companies moving to states with more favorable regulatory and tax policies. Texas is now home to more Fortune 500 companies, including Exxon Mobil, AT&T and American Airlines, than any other state. Goldman Sachs broke ground last year on a Dallas campus that it said could accommodate more than 5,000 employees.\n\nDallas has become one of, if not the, dominant financial centers in the country, if not the world,\" Lee said.\n\nFor months, discussions have swirled around the launch of an \"anti-woke\" Texas stock market in business communities. Lee says the scholarship is apolitical.\n\nTXSE will be entirely electronic, but it plans to have a physical presence in downtown Dallas, said Lee, a Texan who has worked in finance and commerce for about three decades. The exchange plans to compete for primary and dual listings. The TXSE also hopes to attract listings of exchange-traded products.\n\nGetting the new exchange off the ground would be no easy feat. The NYSE and Nasdaq have a real duopoly when it comes to listing shares of American companies. Other exchanges, including IEX and Cboe Global Markets, have attempted to enter the stock listing business, but have gained little traction. The Long Term Exchange, which was approved by the SEC in 2019, has two listings.\n\nDecades ago, there were dozens of regional exchanges outside of New York, but they either closed their doors or were bought out by larger players. The Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange are among those that have been integrated into the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq over the past 20 years.\n\nAttracting trading volumes to a new exchange is also a challenge. Traders often direct orders to exchanges that have the largest volumes. TXSE hopes its backers will help.\n\nCitadel Securities is one of the world's largest electronic trading companies and BlackRock is the world's largest asset management company. BlackRock and Citadel Securities have a history of backing emerging exchanges, including MEMX, which handles between 2% and 3% of stock market volume, according to Cboe data.\n\nNew entrants also benefit from SEC rules that effectively require large brokers to connect to all exchanges, even those with a small market share, and pay for connections and market data.\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to attract more financial activity to the Lone Star State. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, met with foreign exchange officials in 2020 to propose locating their e-commerce hubs in the state of New Jersey, which was considering a transaction tax at the time financial. This decision never materialized.\n\nThe newly created Texas business courts, established as an alternative to Delaware's Court of Chancery system, are another sign of the state's growing stature, Lee said.\n\nThe courts are currently taking center stage as Elon Musks Tesla holds a shareholder vote on whether to move its incorporation to Texas from Delaware.\n\nNever incorporate your business in the State of Delaware,\" Musk tweeted after the Delaware Court of Chancery struck down his multibillion-dollar wage plan earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news",

Wall Street heavyweights BlackRock, Citadel back Dallas plan", "body": "NEW YORK, June 6 -- A Texas businessman wants to launch a national stock exchange in Dallas starting next year, and so far he has raised about US$120 million for the project, with the backing of Wall Street heavyweights BlackRock and Citadel Securities.\n\nThe Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) would see its first trades in 2025, and host listings from 2026, a spokeswoman for the initiative's organisers told AFP, confirming a plan that first appeared in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe financial markets sector in the United States is narrowly concentrated in the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, which together account for nearly all shares trading in the country.\n\nThe TXSE would be entirely electronic, like the Nasdaq, but would have offices in Dallas, the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of Texas financier James Lee, who has so far earned the support of more than two dozen investors, including \"some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world,\" a statement said.\n\nThat list includes BlackRock, the world's top asset manager, and market-making firm Citadel Securities.\n\nSeveral companies have tried to propose alternatives to the NYSE and the Nasdaq, including the Members Exchange (MEMX) launched in 2020, but those only represent a small percentage of trade volume in the United States.\n\nOther small-scale markets include the Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) and the Boston Options Exchange (BOX), which only deals in derivatives, not actual shares.\n\nThe TXSE group plans to submit its registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission later this year, the statement said.\n\n\"TXSE will ultimately create more competition around quote activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets,\" Lee said in the statement.\n\nLee is hoping to capitalise on the rise of Texas in recent years as a favoured destination for US companies looking for a friendlier business environment -- drawn to the Lone Star State for its affordable real estate and favourable tax laws.\n\n\"Dallas has become one of, if not the most, dominant financial centres in the country, if not the world,\" Lee told The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses,\" Lee added in the statement.\n\n\"Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\" -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [],

initiative's organizers told AFP, confirming a plan that first appeared in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe financial markets sector in the United States is narrowly concentrated in the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, which together account for nearly all shares trading in the country.\n\nThe TXSE would be entirely electronic, like the Nasdaq, but would have offices in Dallas, the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of Texas financier James Lee, who has so far earned the support of more than two dozen investors, including \"some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world,\" a statement said.\n\nThat list includes BlackRock, the world's top asset manager, and market-making firm Citadel Securities.\n\nSeveral companies have tried to propose alternatives to the NYSE and the Nasdaq, including the Members Exchange (MEMX) launched in 2020, but those only represent a small percentage of trade volume in the United States.\n\nFavored investment destination\n\nOther small-scale markets include the Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) and the Boston Options Exchange (BOX), which only deals in derivatives, not actual shares.\n\nThe TXSE group plans to submit its registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission later this year, the statement said.\n\n\"TXSE will ultimately create more

Street Journal.\n\n\"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses,\" Lee added in the statement.\n\n\"Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and

The exchange would be fully electronic but be headquartered in Dallas, the company said.\n\nTXSE Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Lee told The Wall Street Journal that the group aims to file with the SEC this year, start facilitating trades next year, and begin hosting its own listings by 2026.\n\nThose supporting the planned Texas exchange \"pledge it will be more CEO-friendly\" than the dominant exchanges in New York, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq, the Journal said.\n\nThe Texas exchange hopes to benefit from companies that are frustrated with regulations like Nasdaq's Board Diversity Rule, and increasing compliance costs that come with listing on the exchanges, the Journal reported. Lee told the newspaper that the TXSE is apolitical.\n\nExchanges based in locations other than New York City used to be more common, but regional exchanges like those based in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia were acquired and folded into the NYSE and Nasdaq over time. Several smaller exchanges still exist across the U.S., but handle much less trading activity than the NYSE and Nasdaq.\n\nThe TXSE Group said that Texas is \"home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state,\" making now an \"opportune time\" to establish the exchange, Lee said.\n\n\"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses,\" Lee said. \"Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\"\n\nTexas' role in the business community has been in the spotlight in recent years as a number of high-profile tech companies like Tesla (TSLA) and Oracle (ORCL) have shifted their headquarters from California to the state.\n\nTesla shareholders are set to vote at next week's annual shareholder meeting on a number of issues, including whether the company should leave Delaware to re-incorporate in Texas after a Delaware court ruled against the company and its multibillion-dollar pay package for CEO Elon Musk.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The goal is to begin facilitating trades in 2025 and host its first listing in 2026.\n\nThe exchange is aiming to tap in to disaffection with increasing compliance costs at Nasdaq and NYSE and newer rules like one setting targets for board diversity at Nasdaq. Backers of the TXSE, as it is known, pledge it will be more CEO-friendly.\n\nAlso behind the move is a shifting U.S. corporate landscape, with dozens of companies moving to states with more favorable regulatory and taxation policies. Texas is now home to more Fortune 500 companies, including Exxon Mobil, AT&T and American Airlines, than any other state. Goldman Sachs broke ground last year on a Dallas campus that it said could house more than 5,000 employees.\n\n\"Dallas has become one of, if not the most, dominant financial centers in the country, if not the world,\" Lee said.\n\nFor months, talk has been swirling in trading communities about an upstart, \"anti-woke\" exchange launching in Texas. Lee says the exchange is apolitical.\n\nTXSE will be entirely electronic, but it plans to have a physical presence in downtown Dallas, said Lee, a Texan who has worked in finance and trading for around three decades. The exchange plans to compete for primary and dual listings. The TXSE also hopes to attract listings of exchange-traded products.\n\nGetting the new exchange off the ground would be no mean feat. NYSE and Nasdaq have an effective duopoly in U.S. corporate stock listings. Other exchanges, including IEX and Cboe Global Markets, have tried to break into the stock-listings business but they have gained little traction. The Long-Term Stock Exchange, which was approved by the SEC in 2019, has two listings.\n\nDecades ago, there were dozens of regional stock exchanges outside of New York, but they either shut down or were acquired by larger players. The Boston Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange are among those that were folded into the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq in the last 20 years.\n\nAttracting trading volumes to a new exchange is also challenging. Traders often direct orders to exchanges that have the greatest volumes. TXSE hopes its backers will help.\n\nCitadel Securities is one of the world's biggest electronic-trading firms, and BlackRock is the world's largest asset-management firm. BlackRock and Citadel Securities have a history of backing upstart exchanges, including MEMX, which handles between 2% and 3% of the stock market's volume, according to Cboe data.\n\nUpstarts also benefit from SEC rules that effectively force large brokers to link to every exchange -- even ones that have small market share -- and pay for connections and market data.\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to bring more financial business to the Lone Star State. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, met with exchange officials in 2020 to pitch a move by their electronic-trading centers to the state from New Jersey, which at the time was considering a tax on financial transactions. The move never materialized.\n\nThe newly formed Texas Business Courts, established as an alternative to the Delaware Court of Chancery system, is another sign of the state's growing stature, Lee said.\n\nThe courts are center stage right now as Elon Musk's Tesla holds a shareholder vote on whether to move its incorporation to Texas from Delaware.\n\n\"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" Musk tweeted after the Delaware Court of Chancery struck down his multibillion-dollar pay package earlier this year.\n\nWrite to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com",

The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) Group has secured $120 million in funding from over two dozen investors, including Larry Fink's Blackrock and Kenneth Griffin's Citadel, making it \"the most well-capitalised exchange entrant to file a registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\"\n\nThe fully electronic TXSE will list various securities, including exchange-traded products and American Depositary Receipts (ADR) for non-US firms. The physical headquarters in Dallas is expected to employ around 100 people, according to The Dallas Morning News.\n\nThe exchange aims to offer a business-friendly environment by challenging new costly regulations and rising compliance expenses at incumbents like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. For instance, Nasdaq's rule mandates companies listed on the exchange to divulge details about board diversity and explain why the board doesn't have \"diverse directors.\"\n\nThe TXSE is well-positioned to address a worrying trend in the US corporate sector. Factors like high litigation costs, stringent disclosure mandates, intensifying shareholder activism, and public criticism have kept many private firms from going public. By staying private, companies have avoided much of the burden and cost of regulatory requirements to focus on future roadmaps.\n\nIn the US, the number of public firms has fallen by over 50% since the '90s, as many are increasingly choosing to stay out of the public eye and influence of public markets.\n\nIn his April shareholder letter, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed concern about shrinking public markets. \"This trend is serious and may very well increase with more regulation and litigation coming. Along with a frank assessment of the regulation landscape, we really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\" he wrote.\n\nThere have been past attempts at regional stock exchanges, like the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Still, many have either failed or merged with the industry leaders. As trading volumes remained concentrated between the NYSE and Nasdaq, it created hurdles for low-volume exchanges to secure substantial orders from investors.\n\nThe TXSE Group acknowledged that \"corporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors\" seek more \"stability and predictability\" around listing rules and related costs. They see this growing shift in US equities markets as an opportunity to grab market share in a sector where the NYSE and Nasdaq dominate trading volumes.\n\nTXSE Group CEO James Lee believes that this dynamic scenario, where more investors and companies are looking for alternatives to trade and list equities, is driving more volumes to exchanges. He added that the Texas exchange will drive competition around \"quote activity, liquidity, and transparency\" to create \"reliable markets that benefit investors and global issuers.\"\n\nThe state and its southeast quadrant neighbours form an economic powerhouse driving economic expansion in the US. As a major business hub, there are over 5,200 private equity-funded companies and 1,500 listed firms across the region. Many private firms are already planning for public listings, and the TXSE can become their preferred gateway to public markets.\n\nWhile the TXSE Group highlighted that Texas accommodates more Fortune 500 companies than any other state, Lee said, \"We're thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas\" and that \"this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "niloy_chakrabarti@ibtimes.co.uk", "name": "Niloy Chakrabarti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American depositary receipt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citadel LLC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

Exchange and Nasdaq, which together account for nearly all of the stocks traded in the country.\n\nThe TXSE would be fully electronic, like Nasdaq, but would have offices in Dallas, the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of Texas financier James Lee, who has so far garnered support from more than two dozen investors, including \"some of the world's largest financial institutions and liquidity providers,\" says a statement.\n\nThat list includes BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and market-making firm Citadel Securities.\n\nSeveral companies have attempted to offer alternatives to the NYSE and Nasdaq, including the Members Exchange (MEMX) launched in 2020, but these represent only a small percentage of trading volume in the United States.\n\nOther small-scale markets include the Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) and the Boston Options Exchange (BOX), which only deal in derivatives and not actual stocks.\n\nTXSE Group plans to submit its registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission later this year, the statement said.\n\n\"The TXSE will ultimately create more competition around listing activities, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets,\" Lee said in the statement.\n\nLee hopes to capitalize on Texas' rise in recent years as a favored destination for U.S. companies seeking a friendlier business environment - attracted to the Lone Star state for its affordable real estate and favorable tax laws .\n\n\"Dallas has become one of the dominant financial centers in the country, if not the world, if not the most important,\" Lee told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Texas and other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses,\" Lee added in the statement.\n\n\"Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and businesses for expanded alternatives to trading and listing stocks, this is an opportune time to build a major national

Backers aim to start facilitating transactions in 2025 before the exchanges first list in 2026.\n\nSupporters argue that a new exchange could improve efficiency and ultimately benefit both investors and businesses.\n\nJames Lee, CEO of TXSE Group, told the Wall Street Journal that the exchange will \"create more competition in listing activity, liquidity and transparency,\" potentially leading to a more robust market overall.\n\nTexas' business-friendly environment is another key factor. The state enjoys a lower tax burden and less strict regulations than New York, where the NYSE resides. This could prove attractive to companies looking to list their shares on a potentially more business-friendly exchange.\n\nFinancial services giants BlackRock and Citadel Securities are among the new exchange's reported backers. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, provides investment expertise, while Citadel Securities, a market maker, plays a crucial role in facilitating trades. The two companies have supported upstart exchanges in the past.\n\nTXSE raised $120 million in its first funding round, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBefore the TXSE can become a reality, it must overcome a significant hurdle, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is responsible for overseeing the U.S. securities markets and ensuring that they operate fairly and efficiently.\n\nObtaining registration with the SEC is complex, with strict requirements regarding securities rules, technology infrastructure and investor protection. The Texas-based exchange plans to file registration documents with the SEC later this year, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe proposed TXSE is not the first challenger to target established exchanges. Some, like the Boston Stock Exchange (BSE), struggled to gain traction and were eventually absorbed by larger players.

The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), headquartered in Dallas, has raised $120 million from more than two dozen investors, according to Chairman and CEO James Lee, CNBC reported.\n\n\"Texas's booming economy and the strong economic and population growth among states in the southeast quadrant of the U.S. present incredible opportunities for businesses -- and ultimately the Texas Stock Exchange,\" Lee said on LinkedIn.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on the endeavor earlier, noting that the exchange is positioning itself as a \"more-CEO friendly\" alternative to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq amid increasing regulation and compliance costs.\n\nTXSE's website outlines plans for a \"fully electronic, national securities exchange\" that will seek registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the Journal's report, the group aims to start trading in 2025 and host listings in 2026.\n\nA significant point of contention for existing exchanges like Nasdaq is the rule requiring listed companies to disclose diversity information on their boards of directors. Approved by the SEC in 2021, this rule now faces a challenge in a federal appeals court.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News reported that TXSE will target companies in the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. In an interview with the newspaper, Lee expressed gratitude to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) for his support and leadership.\n\nBlackRock's relationship with officials in Republican-leaning Texas has been complex in recent years, according to Reuters.\n\nThe company, a significant investor in oil companies like Exxon (XOM.N), has faced criticism for refusing to divest fossil fuel holdings and has been accused of indirectly boycotting certain industries by advocating for broader emission disclosures from its portfolio companies.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink was seen alongside Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick in February at an event promoting infrastructure investments in Houston.\n\nHowever, the following month, a state fund withdrew $8.5 billion from BlackRock's management, citing concerns over the company's energy policies. Despite this, a BlackRock spokesperson stated that the company is proud to be a founding investor in the Texas Stock Exchange and aims to enhance liquidity and market effectiveness in U.S. capital markets.\n\nPrior to this involvement, Citadel Securities had supported various exchanges focusing on different assets, including the Members Exchange for equities and options, the FMX Futures Exchange, and the EDX Markets for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe new exchange seeks to capitalize on Texas's economic growth and favorable business climate to attract companies disenchanted with current regulatory environments. The backing from high-profile investors such as BlackRock and Citadel Securities underscores the potential seen in this venture.\n\nAs the TXSE prepares for its launch, it will focus on providing a business-friendly environment, leveraging the economic strengths of Texas and surrounding states to draw in new listings and foster a dynamic trading ecosystem.\n\nJim Thomas \u2709\n\nJim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

TXSE will work to provide access to U.S. capital markets for U.S. and global companies and will provide a venue for trading and listing public companies as well as the growing universe of exchange-traded products. TXSE will be a fully electronic national securities exchange that will apply for registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nTXSE Group Inc. successfully completed its first fundraising round with participation from more than two dozen investors, including some of the world's largest financial institutions and liquidity providers, such as BlackRock and Citadel Securities, as well as prominent business leaders from across the country. .\n\nThe liquidity providers supporting TXSE Group Inc. account for a significant portion of equity volume on U.S. exchanges and together account for the majority of all U.S.-listed retail volume. With approximately $120 million of capital raised, TXSE is expected to be the most well-capitalized stock market player to file a registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe planned launch of TXSE comes as changes in the stock markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and competition. Issuing companies and sponsors of exchange-traded products are demanding more stability and predictability regarding listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to the U.S. capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment to public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\n\n\"Changes in the securities markets are generating more trading volumes and more choices for issuers and sponsors,\" said James Leefounder and CEO of TXSE Group Inc. \"TXSE will ultimately create more competition in listing activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets that will benefit both investors, to global issuers and liquidity providers.\n\nTexas and other states in the southeastern quadrant of the United States lead the nation in economic expansion and population growth, making it Texas the clear choice for the creation of a new national securities exchange. For decades, Texas has been the nation's leader in attracting corporate relocations and expansions. It is home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state and more than 5,200 privately sponsored companies, many of which are preparing to enter the public markets. Additionally, there are more than 1,500 publicly traded companies across the region.\n\n\"We are delighted to realize the long-held vision of a national stock exchange in Texas\", Lee said. \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant became economic powers. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and businesses for expanded alternatives to trading and listing stocks, this is an opportune time to build a major national exchange in Texas\".\n\nTXSE intends to submit registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\nAbout TXSE Group inc. :\n\nTXSE Group Inc. is the parent company of the Texas Stock Exchange. TXSE will work to provide access to U.S. capital markets for U.S. and global companies and will provide a venue for trading and listing public companies as well as the growing universe of exchange-traded products. Subject to approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, TXSE will be a fully electronic national securities exchange providing access to U.S. equity markets.

They are now seeking to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\nTexas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. \"Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and businesses for expanded alternatives to trading and listing stocks, this is an opportune time to build a major national exchange in Texas,\" said James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group.\n\nStock exchanges are private institutions where stocks, bonds and other securities are traded. If the SEC authorizes TXSE to begin operations, it will be the first exchange to launch in the country in recent years.\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journalwhich was first to report on the creation of the new exchange, TXSE promises to be more CEO-friendly than other exchanges and wants to capitalize on discontent over new rules and rising compliance costs at Nasdaq and the NYSE.\n\nLooking at the three states with the largest economies, New York has two stock exchanges. Texas, comparable to California, is experiencing very rapid economic and population growth and already has a large number of headquarters of the largest Fortune 500 companies. So it makes sense that Dallas would be an ideal location, said Steven Pedigo, a professor at the University of Texas at Austins LBJ School of Public Affairs and an expert in economic and urban development.\n\nBut it could be difficult for a new exchange to take off in the U.S. listings market, where Nasdaq and the NYSE have dominated for decades. U.S. stock trading activity includes about 16 stock exchanges, with the NYSE accounting for more than 20% of stock trading volume in May and the Nasdaq more than 15%, according to Bloomberg. Nasdaq acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange And Boston Stock Exchangetwo of the oldest stock exchanges in the country, in 2007. The NYSE purchased the Chicago Stock Exchange in 2018.\n\nWhat makes this project interesting are the large companies that supported and financed the new exchange, which is why it could be a serious competitor. But it's a story that must continue, Pedigo said.\n\nFounders of the TXSE said they chose Texas as the home of the new national securities exchange because of the state's rapid economic and population growth. Texas has been a leader in attracting business relocations and expansions in recent years. More than 7,200 companies moved to Texas between 2010 and 2019, creating nearly 103,000 jobs, according to data of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Companies that have moved to Texas have primarily gone to the state's major metropolitan areas, with Dallas and Houston being the favored destinations.\n\nMajor companies like Tesla and Toyota have chosen the state as their new home base in recent years. Large financial companies like Goldman Sachs have also made big investments lately in Dallas.\n\nPedigo said this new exchange would not necessarily lead to new jobs in the state, but would help further strengthen the business-friendly image Texas has worked on for years.\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas at Austin - LBJ School of Public Affairs have financially supported The Texas Tribune, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

With $120 million already raised, the exchange is set to file registration documents with the SEC later this year and targets to become operational by 2025, hosting its first listing in 2026.\n\nThe primary focus of TXSE will be to attract listings of Exchange Traded Products. ETFs are financial instruments traded on stock exchanges that derive their value from underlying assets such as stocks, commodities, or indices. Common types of ETFs include Exchange Traded Funds, Exchange Traded Notes, Exchange Traded Commodities, and Exchange Traded Vehicles. This focus on ETPs positions TXSE to become a significant player in the evolving landscape of financial products.\n\nCitadel Securities has confirmed the establishment of TXSE and its substantial financial backing of $120 million. The exchange is expected to submit its registration documents to the SEC within this year, making a crucial step toward its anticipated launch. Interestingly, BlackRock has not yet shared their response to this announcement, adding an element of intrigue to the partnership dynamics.\n\nThis move comes at a time when BlackRock is also making strides in integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. The firm recently updated its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund prospects, adding five major Wall Street firms as authorised participants: ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and USB Securities. This update is significant amid increased regulatory scrutiny over Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT, a prominent Bitcoin Spot ETF, boasts the second-largest asset under management at $17.24 billion, trailing only Grayscale's GBTC. In terms of 24-hour trading volume, IBIT significantly outperforms, with over $1.32 billion compared to GBTC's $367.56 million. Known for its competitive fees of 0.12%, IBIT underscores BlackRock's innovative approach to financial products.\n\nThe collaboration between BlackRock and Citadel Securities to launch the Texas Stock Exchange represents a strategic leap forward in the financial markets. By focusing on ETP listings and integrating cryptocurrencies, TXSE is poised to become a key player in the evolving financial landscape. This initiative not only reflects the dynamic nature of financial markets but also highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional and digital finance.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABN_AMRO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABN AMRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625670", "eventUri": "eng-9625670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In addition, there are more than 1,500 publicly traded companies throughout the southeast quadrant of the U.S. The new exchange is hoping to capitalize on the many companies that are preparing to access the public markets.\n\nBeck Andrew Salgado covers trending topics in the Austin business ecosystem for the American-Statesman.

The TXSE has raised $120 million and plans to file registration documents with the SEC, according to CEO James Lee. The new exchange, headquartered in Dallas, targets its first trades in 2025 and first listings in 2026. This move highlights Texas' growing appeal in the financial sector, with major firms like Goldman Sachs (GS) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) already expanding their presence in the state.\n\nThe TXSE seeks to attract companies looking to escape the rising compliance costs associated with the NYSE and Nasdaq. The exchange will focus on providing a venue for US and global companies to access equity capital markets and trade a growing universe of exchange-traded products. BlackRock (BLK) and Citadel have expressed optimism about the project, citing potential benefits such as increased liquidity and market efficiency. This initiative is part of a broader trend of new exchanges attempting to disrupt established players by offering more competitive and innovative solutions.\n\nThe competitive landscape for stock exchanges is intense, with the NYSE and Nasdaq holding significant market shares. In May, NYSE exchanges accounted for over 20% of US equities trading volume, while Nasdaq represented more than 15%. New exchanges like TXSE face the challenge of convincing companies to list with them, offering incentives such as marketing support and unique trading features. Previous efforts, like MEMX and IEX, have made inroads by addressing specific market participant concerns, but achieving substantial market share remains difficult.\n\nTexas has become an increasingly attractive location for corporations and financial firms due to its lower taxes and more relaxed regulatory environment. Companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan (JPM) have significantly expanded their operations in Texas. The state is also developing a business-court system to handle complex corporate litigation. Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) has proposed moving its incorporation to Texas, further underscoring the state's growing influence in the corporate world.

They are now seeking registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\n\"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas,\" said James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group.\n\nStock exchanges are private institutions where stocks, bonds and other securities are traded. If the SEC clears TXSE to begin operations, it will be the first stock exchange to launch in the country in recent years.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the creation of the new exchange, TXSE promises to be more CEO-friendly than other exchanges and wants to capitalize on discontent over new rules and rising compliance costs at Nasdaq and NYSE.\n\n\"If we look at the three states with the largest economy, New York has two stock exchanges. Texas, comparably to California, is growing economically and demographically really fast, and already has a big number of Fortune 500 biggest companies headquarters, so it makes sense Dallas would be an ideal place,\" said Steven Pedigo, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's LBJ School of Public Affairs and an expert in economic and urban development.\n\nBut it could be difficult for a new exchange to take off in the U.S. listings market, where the Nasdaq and NYSE have dominated for decades. The U.S. exchange business consists of about 16 equities exchanges with NYSE accounting for more than 20% of the volume in equities trading in May and Nasdaq over 15%, according to Bloomberg. Nasdaq acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Boston Stock Exchange, two of the oldest exchanges in the country, in 2007. The NYSE bought the Chicago Stock Exchange in 2018.\n\n\"What makes this project interesting is the big companies that supported and financed the new stock exchange, that is why it could be a serious competitor. But it is a 'to be continued' story,\" Pedigo said.\n\nTXSE founders said they chose Texas as the home for the new national securities exchange because of the state's rapid economic and population growth. Texas has been a leader in attracting business relocations and expansions in recent years. More than 7,200 firms relocated to Texas between 2010 and 2019, creating nearly 103,000 jobs, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Businesses that relocated to Texas mostly went to the state's major metropolitan areas, with Dallas and Houston being the favored destinations.\n\nMajor corporations like Tesla and Toyota have chosen the state as their new home base in recent years. Big financial companies like Goldman Sachs have also made big investments lately in Dallas.\n\nPedigo said this new stock exchange wouldn't necessarily lead to more jobs being created in the state but would help further bolster the pro-business image Texas has been working on for years.\n\nDisclosure: University of Texas at Austin and University of Texas at Austin - LBJ School of Public Affairs have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Could the home of black gold help unlock a blockchain and digital gold boom?\n\nA new BlackRock-backed stock exchange to be launched in Texas has sparked renewed excitement among the crypto community about the widespread adoption of tokenised financial assets.\n\nInvestors including finance giants BlackRock and Citadel Securities have raised $120 million in capital to launch an electronic, national stock exchange that will enable trading in securities and exchange-traded products, to be headquartered in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThat makes the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) the most well-capitalised exchange to file for registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). An announcement about the new exchange stated: \"The liquidity providers backing TXSE Group Inc. represent a significant portion of the equity volume on U.S. lit exchanges and together comprise a majority of all U.S. listed retail volume.\"\n\nWith BlackRock CEO Larry Fink now bullish on a tokenised future -- crypto circles are rife with speculation about blockchain integration with TXSE for tokenised securities and 24/7 trading.\n\nRelated: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Tokenisation to Bring in Financial Revolution\n\nTexas Stock Exchange Increases Competition: Does It Flag Tokenisation Uptake?\n\nComing up against incumbents like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) will \"ultimately create more competition around quote activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets that benefit investors, global issuers and liquidity providers alike,\" according to founder and CEO James Lee.\n\nTXSE hopes to be facilitating trading by 2025 and accepting listings of companies by 2026. It could help open up public markets for more companies, including crypto companies looking to become publicly listed.\n\nJames Lee says Texas was the clear choice for a new exchange given its ability to attract business, expansions, publicly traded companies and equity-sponsored companies preparing to go public.\n\nAccording to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, the state represents the eighth-largest economy in the world, with an annual GDP of US$2.35 trillion.\n\nRelated: BlackRock Advances Tokenisation Efforts with Upcoming Fund Launch Via Ethereum\n\nWith the world's largest asset manager a key investor in TXSE, many are hopeful asset tokenisation will play a larger role as the exchange develops.

Wall Street Bigwigs BlackRock, Citadel Lead Charge For New 'Apolitical,' 'CEO-Friendly' Stock Exchange In Texas By Benzinga", "body": "What Happened: A group led by BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, and hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin's Citadel Securities, are developing plans for a new national stock exchange based in Texas, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe exchange, named the \"Texas Stock Exchange\" (TXSE), has reportedly secured $120 million in funding from individuals and large investment firms. It aims to file registration documents with the SEC later this year and begin trading in 2025, with the first company listing expected in 2026, according to TXSE CEO James Lee, who spoke with the Journal.\n\nAmbitious Goals: TXSE will be a fully electronic exchange headquartered in downtown Dallas. Lee told the Journal the exchange will attract both initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary listings, as well as exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\nThe proposed exchange plans to leverage its prominent backers like BlackRock and Citadel to attract trading volume. The report said it may also benefit from SEC rules requiring large brokers to connect to all exchanges.\n\nMotivations: The reported move comes amidst concerns over stringent regulatory requirements laid down by the NYSE and Nasdaq. Companies listing on these exchanges now face higher compliance costs and new rules, such as board diversity targets set by Nasdaq, the report added. TXSE reportedly aims to be more CEO-friendly and apolitical.\n\nA Business-Friendly Hub: The choice of Texas as the exchange's location reflects the state's growing popularity among businesses due to its favorable regulatory and tax policies. Companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which is seeking shareholder approval to move its headquarters from Delaware to Texas, exemplify this trend.\n\nTexas now boasts more Fortune 500 companies than any other state, including Exxon Mobil, AT&T, and American Airlines, the report said.\n\nChallenges Ahead: Establishing a new exchange will be a significant undertaking. Existing national exchanges like IEX and CBOE Global Markets haven't been able to gain significant traction in stock listings, and several regional exchanges have been absorbed by the NYSE or Nasdaq over the past two decades.\n\nEven established exchanges like the NYSE have faced challenges, with a recent technical glitch causing stock price fluctuations and trading halts. Despite these hurdles, TXSE's arrival could potentially introduce competition and potentially lead to more favorable terms for companies listing on public exchanges.\n\nMarket Reaction: The Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, closed Tuesday's session up 0.83% at $134.76, while Nasdaq climbed 1.17% to $59.43, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: Best ETFs to Buy Right Now", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

A group of financial firms and investors are planning on launching a stock exchange in Dallas this year.\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune's daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\n(Texas Tribune) -- A group of financial firms and investors is planning to launch a Texas-based private market stock exchange and offer traders an alternative to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.\n\nThe group, which includes BlackRock, Citadel Securities and about two dozen investors, raised approximately $120 million of capital to create the Texas Stock Exchange, which would be headquartered in Dallas. They are now seeking registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.\n\n\"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas,\" said James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group.\n\nStock exchanges are private institutions where stocks, bonds and other securities are traded. If the SEC clears TXSE to begin operations, it will be the first stock exchange to launch in the country in recent years.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the creation of the new exchange, TXSE promises to be more CEO-friendly than other exchanges and wants to capitalize on discontent over new rules and rising compliance costs at Nasdaq and NYSE.\n\n\"If we look at the three states with the largest economy, New York has two stock exchanges. Texas, comparably to California, is growing economically and demographically really fast, and already has a big number of Fortune 500 biggest companies headquarters, so it makes sense Dallas would be an ideal place,\" said Steven Pedigo, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's LBJ School of Public Affairs and an expert in economic and urban development.\n\nBut it could be difficult for a new exchange to take off in the U.S. listings market, where the Nasdaq and NYSE have dominated for decades. The U.S. exchange business consists of about 16 equities exchanges with NYSE accounting for more than 20% of the volume in equities trading in May and Nasdaq over 15%, according to Bloomberg. Nasdaq acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Boston Stock Exchange, two of the oldest exchanges in the country, in 2007. The NYSE bought the Chicago Stock Exchange in 2018.\n\n\"What makes this project interesting is the big companies that supported and financed the new stock exchange, that is why it could be a serious competitor. But it is a 'to be continued' story,\" Pedigo said.\n\nTXSE founders said they chose Texas as the home for the new national securities exchange because of the state's rapid economic and population growth. Texas has been a leader in attracting business relocations and expansions in recent years. More than 7,200 firms relocated to Texas between 2010 and 2019, creating nearly 103,000 jobs, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Businesses that relocated to Texas mostly went to the state's major metropolitan areas, with Dallas and Houston being the favored destinations.\n\nMajor corporations like Tesla and Toyota have chosen the state as their new home base in recent years. Big financial companies like Goldman Sachs have also made big investments lately in Dallas.\n\nPedigo said this new stock exchange wouldn't necessarily lead to more jobs being created in the state but would help further bolster the pro-business image Texas has been working on for years.\n\nDisclosure: University of Texas at Austin and University of Texas at Austin - LBJ School of Public Affairs have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

But the next month, a state fund withdrew $8.5 billion from BlackRock's management, citing the company's energy policies.\n\n\"BlackRock is proud to be a founding investor in the Texas Stock Exchange to increase liquidity and improve market efficiency for clients and other investors in the U.S. capital markets,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe parent companies that run NYSE and Nasdaq have historically swallowed up smaller stock exchanges including ones in Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans agreed to hear a challenge by conservative groups who filed suit against Nasdaq over a rule requiring companies to disclose board diversity figures.\n\nThe rule approved by the SEC in August 2021 requires companies listed on the exchange to have one director who identifies as female, a member of an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority, or LGBTQ+, or explain why they do not.\n\nCompanies would generally need two diverse directors to satisfy the rule by 2026.\n\nThe rule drew lawsuits from conservative legal activists including Alliance for Fair Board Recruitment, a group founded by affirmative action opponent Edward Blum.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental, social, and corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

But the next month, a state fund withdrew $8.5 billion from BlackRock's management, citing the company's energy policies.", "source": {"uri": "dealstreetasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The group behind the new TXSE has the support of market maker Citadel Securities and Wall Street's BlackRock. The TXSE plans to challenge the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.\n\nReports show that BlackRock and Citadel Securities are behind the undisclosed firm. The firm plans to launch a new national stock exchange. Upon approval, the national stock exchange will be launched in Texas and will direct its focus on ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, Citigroup, and UBS join BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF\n\nAccording to the reports, the undisclosed firm will file for registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of 2024. WSJ reported that Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has raised close to $120 million for the project.\n\nThe TXSE is reportedly going to focus on exchange-traded funds (ETFs). TXSE's pursuit of ETF listings may have been fueled by the ongoing developments in the ETF market. The new exchange could provide an alternative solution in light of the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the ongoing ETH ETF discussions.\n\nThe TXSE is looking to improve listing options within the United States. Specifically, the proposed Texas-based national stock exchange wants to offer affordable solutions, with many companies reporting increasing compliance costs at both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.\n\nExchanges like the Nasdaq, for instance, have reportedly imposed new rules that set targets for the company's board diversity. Although necessary, such rules may easily deter some companies from listing and increase onboarding time. The TXSE is looking to simplify the listing process and provide its services at affordable costs with minimal hurdles.\n\nThe TXSE has been fronted as the national exchange that will place its focus on electronic-traded funds. The focus on ETFs comes as a relief for crypto-related ETFs currently being introduced to the market. The U.S. SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs this year, and they are already trading on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.\n\nThe U.S. SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs early this year. About five months later, the regulator also approved all eight Ethereum ETF applications. Prior to the approval, the industry was extremely skeptical of the ETH ETF approval. Many industry observers expected the U.S. SEC to reject the applications because it considers Ether a securities offering.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETFs Make 56% of Fidelity's and 26% of BlackRock's 2024 Inflows\n\nThe U.S. SEC approved eight ETFs from VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Invesco Galaxy, ARK21 Shares, Fidelity, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton. The regulator confirmed the applications were consistent with the Exchange Act.\n\nAlthough the ETH ETFs are not yet tradable, pending further approvals, the SEC has confirmed the viability to the crypto community. Following these developments, BlackRock and Citadel Securities' move to back a new Texas-based national exchange firm appears well calculated.\n\nTexas is generally crypto-friendly, and BlackRock has shown major interest in cryptocurrency. Currently, its iShares Bitcoin Trust is the largest Bitcoin ETF. The joint launch of TXSE could be a major boost for crypto-related ETFs, as ETH ETFs are yet to hit the market.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market maker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invesco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fidelity Investments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Templeton_Investments", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin Templeton Investments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625670", "eventUri": "eng-9625670", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

In 1996, there were 8,000 companies listed on American stock exchanges. Today, that number has dropped more than 50% to just 3,700, according todata fromthe Security Pricing Research Center.\n\nIt's not that America has half as many businesses as there did 30 years ago, but rather that businesses remain increasingly private, largely outside the control of the public and markets.\n\nIncreased reporting requirements, higher litigation costs, costly regulations, authoritarian board governance, shareholder activism, increased public scrutiny, and quarterly earnings pressure have driven companies away from public markets.\n\nThere are about five times as many private equity-backed companies in the United States today as there are.listed companiesaccording to Wells Fargo economists.\n\nThe trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average U.S. technology company transitioned to the public markets after four years, according to a Wells Fargo study. In 2019, this figure increased to 11 years.\n\nCompanies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans, they write.\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed concern about the changes in his annual letter to shareholders in April.

Issuing companies and sponsors of exchange-traded products are demanding more stability and predictability regarding listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to the U.S. capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment to public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\n\nWhile the

In a statement, TXSE Group said that the exchange is apolitical.\n\nTXSE Group acknowledged but declined to respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nHere's what to know about the Texas Stock Exchange and what it says about the corporate culture wars.\n\nHeadquartered in Dallas, the Texas Stock Exchange will be a fully electronic, national exchange that allows companies to list and trade on its platform.\n\nThe new exchange also plans to list exchange-traded products, a growing category of investment vehicles that allow customers to bet on a basket of assets. An exchange-traded bitcoin fund, for instance, allows clients to invest in bitcoin without holding the underlying cryptocurrency.\n\nMore than two dozen investors have backed the exchange with a total of more than $120 billion in funds, the TXSE Group said in a statement.\n\nThe exchange plans to attract businesses frustrated by stringent listing standards and the increasing costs they impose, the TXSE group added. For instance, the Nasdaq has imposed new rules setting targets for board diversity, the group said.\n\n\"Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas,\" James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group, said in a statement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported details about the exchange.\n\nThe announcement coincides with a conservative backlash against climate-friendly business practices as well as diversity, equity and inclusion policies derided by some critics as \"woke capitalism.\"\n\nAnalysts who spoke to ABC News differed over the extent to which the Texas Stock Exchange serves as a listing or trading alternative for conservative-leaning companies.\n\nSome said 'anti-woke' branding would make up a key selling point for the new exchange, while others downplayed the role of politics for an exchange that promises lower compliance costs, as the Texas Stock Exchange does.\n\n\"Texas has a pretty clear message: 'If you're anti-woke, come here,'\" Larry Tabb, head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence, told ABC News.\n\nAs technological advances have taken stock exchanges online and lowered the baseline cost of offering high-quality services, the exchanges have sought alternative means of attracting customers, Tabb said. These days, the primary features that distinguish exchanges are listing rules, branding, and liquidity, he noted, but he emphasized branding.\n\nWhen companies list with the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, they draw on the credibility associated with those highly visible exchanges, Tabb added.\n\n\"They want to be affiliated with where you ring the bell or the exchange in Times Square,\" Tabb said, noting that companies critical of sustainable practices or robust regulations may want an exchange affiliated with that point of view.\n\n\"The Texas exchange might draw energy companies; it might draw Tesla,\" Tabb said, adding, \"I'm not sure most companies want to be on the outer edge of the culture war issue.\"\n\nChristine Parlour, professor of finance and accounting at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business, downplayed the role of politics in the Texas exchange. Instead, she said, most prospective clients are primarily focused on where they can find liquidity.\n\n\"All exchanges are money-making entities,\" Parlour said. \"At some point, people want to make money. So things can't or won't be completely driven by perception.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market maker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_School_of_Business", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haas School of Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Groupware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Groupware", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers_and_Routing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers and Routing", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/74cf4230-5a46-4da9-b87f-1a9e997e50f6/stock-exchange-gty-jt-240605_1717610790878_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625670", "eventUri": "eng-9625670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

They reportedly intend to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of this year, and will start facilitating trades in 2025.\n\nExcessive regulations at Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are challenges to investors which the TXSE aims to take advantage of, the outlet reported. Among the regulations concerning investors is a Nasdaq \"Board Diversity Rule.\" (RELATED: Meme Stock Pioneer's Tweet Sends GameStop Shares Soaring, Forces Exchanges To Halt Trading)\n\nThe creation of this Dallas-based stock exchange is happening as American corporations have moved to Texas for favorable tax rates and reduced regulation. \"When companies are on the move, many head to Texas.

It intends to begin facilitating exchanges in 2025 and hold its first listing in 2026, the Journal reported.\n\nThe TXSE will focus on facilitating access to U.S. capital markets for companies nationwide and around the world. It will also serve as a platform for trading and listing public companies as well as the growing field of exchange-traded products.\n\nWe are excited to realize our long-held vision of a national stock exchange in Texas, said James Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE Group, in a statement. Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and businesses for expanded alternatives to trading and listing stocks, this is an opportune time to build a major national exchange in Texas.\n\nTexas has become a pioneer in economic expansion and population growth, as businesses flock there in search of tax cuts and a laxer regulatory environment: the statenow has about 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies and about 1,500 publicly traded companies, according to the press release.\n\nIn the banking sector,Goldman Sachs builds 800,000 square foot campus in Dallas to serve more than 5,000 employees. JPMorgan Chase has more than 30,000 employees working in Texas, a figure that exceeds its 29,000 employees in New York, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe launch of TXSEs comes as issuing companies and sponsors of exchange-traded products seek greater stability and predictability regarding listing standards and associated costs.\n\nChanges in the stock markets are generating more volume on the exchanges and more choices for issuers and sponsors,\" Lee said in a statement Wednesday. TXSE will ultimately create more competition around listing activity, liquidity and transparency, which will result in more consistent and reliable markets that will benefit investors, global issuers and liquidity providers.\n\nThe exchange aims to capitalize on growing corporate dissatisfaction with rising compliance costs and new regulations, such as those mandating diversity goals on the boards of Nasdaq and the NYSE. Supporters of the TXSE say it will be more CEO-friendly, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNasdaq established board diversity rule which requires publicly traded companies to disclose board-level diversity data annually. The SEC approved the proposal in 2021, but the rule is being challenged in federal appeals court.\n\nIn the past, there were many regional exchanges outside of New York, but they either closed or were bought out by larger players, the WSJ reported. The creation of a new stock exchange would constitute a major challenge because the NYSE and the Nasdaq hold a real duopoly on the listing of shares of American companies. Traders generally direct orders to exchanges with the largest volumes. TXSE plans to have its backers assist in this regard, the WSJ reported.\n\nIn addition, Texas Establishes Specialized Business Court System to attract more of the complex corporate litigation cases for which Delaware is traditionally famous. These courts will be alternative venues for specific cases exceeding $5 million and will be officially established on September 1.\n\nElon Musks Tesla, for its part, is urging its shareholders to vote in favor of a proposal to move the company's bylaws from Delaware to Texas at this month's annual meeting.

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nIn an exciting development for the financial markets, BlackRock and Citadel Securities have announced their collaboration to launch a new national stock exchange in Texas, named the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE). With $120 million already raised, the exchange is set to file registration documents with the SEC later this year and targets to become operational by 2025, hosting its first listing in 2026.\n\nThe primary focus of TXSE will be to attract listings of Exchange Traded Products. ETFs are financial instruments traded on stock exchanges that derive their value from underlying assets such as stocks, commodities, or indices. Common types of ETFs include Exchange Traded Funds, Exchange Traded Notes, Exchange Traded Commodities, and Exchange Traded Vehicles. This focus on ETPs positions TXSE to become a significant player in the evolving landscape of financial products.\n\nCitadel Securities has confirmed the establishment of TXSE and its substantial financial backing of $120 million. The exchange is expected to submit its registration documents to the SEC within this year, making a crucial step toward its anticipated launch. Interestingly, BlackRock has not yet shared their response to this announcement, adding an element of intrigue to the partnership dynamics.\n\nThis move comes at a time when BlackRock is also making strides in integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. The firm recently updated its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund prospects, adding five major Wall Street firms as authorised participants: ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and USB Securities. This update is significant amid increased regulatory scrutiny over Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT, a prominent Bitcoin Spot ETF, boasts the second-largest asset under management at $17.24 billion, trailing only Grayscale's GBTC. In terms of 24-hour trading volume, IBIT significantly outperforms, with over $1.32 billion compared to GBTC's $367.56 million. Known for its competitive fees of 0.12%, IBIT underscores BlackRock's innovative approach to financial products.\n\nThe collaboration between BlackRock and Citadel Securities to launch the Texas Stock Exchange represents a strategic leap forward in the financial markets. By focusing on ETP listings and integrating cryptocurrencies, TXSE is poised to become a key player in the evolving financial landscape. This initiative not only reflects the dynamic nature of financial markets but also highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional and digital finance.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nidhi_kolhapur@coinpedia.org", "name": "Nidhi Kolhapur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Citadel Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABN_AMRO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABN AMRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/25153924/Volume-Price-Action-Trading-Demystified_-Crypto-Trading-Made-Simple.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625670", "eventUri": "eng-9625670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Its comments on listings were interpreted by many as a plan to offer standards less onerous than those required by the New York Stock Exchange or its rival Nasdaq. But market participants questioned TXSE's ability to make headway in a crowded market.\n\nThere are already 24 regulated US securities exchanges -- a group that includes options and stock markets -- but while all offer trading, the two New York-based bourses dominate the business of listing new companies and maintaining standards for those they already host. A host of others, including IEX, have tried to break the duopoly in the last decade, but to little success.\n\n\"We've tried it. We've done well on the [exchange traded fund] side, but on the corporate listing side, it's hard,\" said Fred Tomczyk, chief executive of Cboe Global Markets, the US's third-largest stock market. \"If you're going to try to do it on a lighter regulatory touch, I don't know how you do it because we do have a regulator.\"\n\n\"Does the world need another competitive listings venue for companies? My answer is probably not, but I wish them luck,\" Doug Cifu, CEO and co-founder of Nasdaq-listed market maker Virtu, told Piper Sandler's annual exchanges conference on Wednesday.\n\nCifu said he had turned down the chance to invest in TXSE because he was not convinced by its listings push.\n\n\"I think Nasdaq and [the] New York [Stock Exchange] do a wonderful job. They're highly competitive,\" he added.\n\nNasdaq and the NYSE, part of Intercontinental Exchange, declined to comment. One senior New York-based exchange official pointed to the history of failed attempts to break the NYSE-Nasdaq stranglehold, adding: \"Most of that regulation isn't coming from the exchanges; it's the regulator.\"\n\nThe San Francisco-based Long Term Stock Exchange launched in 2020 with the aim of attracting buy-and-hold investors and has so far listed two companies. It did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIEX, which launched trading in 2013 and a listings business in 2017, only attracted a single listing by the time it closed the unit in 2019 to focus on trading.

The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding - that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC.\n\n\"We're thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\" TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\"\n\nThe group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public.\n\nLee told The Wall Street Journal that the group hopes to officially launch its exchange in 2026.\n\nThe problem with going public\n\nAmerica has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices.\n\nIt's not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago - it's that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets.\n\nIntensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets.\n\nThere are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo.\n\nThe trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years.\n\n\"Companies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\" they wrote.\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \"This trend is serious,\" he wrote. \"We really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\"\n\nThe TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden.\n\n\"TXSE's planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\" they wrote. \"Corporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\"\n\nWhile the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami.\n\nThis exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_goodkind@cnn.com",

His comments on the listings were interpreted by many as a plan to offer less onerous standards than those required by the New York Stock Exchange or its rival Nasdaq. But market participants have questioned the TXSE's ability to advance in a crowded market.\n\nThere are already 24 regulated U.S. securities exchanges, a group that includes options and stock markets, but while all offer trading, the two New York-based exchanges dominate the industry in listing new companies and maintaining standards for those they already host. Many others, including IEX, have attempted to break the duopoly over the past decade, but without much success.\n\nWe tried it. We did well on the [exchange traded fund] side, but on the side of listing companies, it's difficult, said Fred Tomczyk, chief executive of Cboe Global Markets, the third-largest exchange in the United States. If you try to do it with lighter regulation, I don't know how to do it because we have a regulator.\n\nDoes the world need another competitive listing venue for businesses? My answer is probably no, but I wish them well, Doug Cifu, CEO and co-founder of Nasdaq-listed market maker Virtu, said Wednesday at Piper Sandlers' annual stock market conference.\n\nCifu said it turned down the opportunity to invest in TXSE because it was not convinced by its listing push.\n\nI think the Nasdaq and [the] new York [Stock Exchange] do a wonderful job. They are very competitive, he added.\n\nNasdaq and the NYSE, part of the Intercontinental Exchange, declined to comment. A senior New York-based exchange official highlighted the history of failed attempts to break the NYSE's stranglehold on the Nasdaq, adding: Most of this regulation doesn't come from the exchanges; this is the regulator.\n\nThe San Francisco-based long-term exchange launched in 2020 with the aim of attracting buy-and-hold investors and has listed two companies so far. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIEX, which launched trading in 2013 and a listing business in 2017, attracted only one listing by the time it closed the unit in 2019 to focus on trading. That company, Interactive Brokers, returned to Nasdaq.\n\nThe Nasdaq and NYSE charge a lot, which isn't necessarily best for businesses. I understand their intentions are good, but it's a lot of forcing people to do, Thomas Peterffy, billionaire founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers, told the Financial Times on Wednesday.\n\nA 2021 Nasdaq rule requiring companies to disclose board diversity and an explanation if their board is not diverse has come under particular attack.

The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding - that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC.\n\n\"We're thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\" TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\"\n\nThe group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public.\n\nAmerica has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices.\n\nIt's not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago - it's that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets.\n\nIntensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets.\n\nThere are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo.\n\nThe trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years.\n\n\"Companies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\" they wrote.\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \"This trend is serious,\" he wrote. \"We really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\"\n\nThe TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden.\n\n\"TXSE's planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\" they wrote. \"Corporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\"\n\nWhile the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami.\n\nThis exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nRepublican officeholders in Texas have spent the past three years or so bashing the A-list financial firm BlackRock on account of the company's support for renewable energy. Well, that was then. BlackRock has suddenly emerged as one of the key funders of the proposed new TXSE national stock exchange headquartered in Dallas, with some interesting implications for renewable energy investing throughout Texas and the entire Southeast.\n\nBefore we get to story behind renewable energy and the BlackRock-bashing, let's take a look at the TXSE proposal.\n\nAs scooped earlier this week by The Wall Street Journal, TXSE is headquartered in Dallas, pending registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. If all goes according to plan, the aim is to begin trading in 2025 and commence listings in 2026.\n\nIn a press release dated June 5, TXSE's parent company TXSE Group Inc. stated that it will \"focus on enabling U.S. and global companies to access U.S. equity capital markets and will provide a venue to trade and list public companies and the growing universe of exchange-traded products.\"\n\nTXSE Group notes that more than two dozen investors were involved in raising initial capital, \"including some of the largest financial institutions and liquidity providers in the world.\" The firm cited two specific examples, BlackRock and the firm Citadel Capital.\n\nThis latest news about BlackRock and Texas is more than a little weird, considering that it follows on the heels of a 2021 Texas state law aimed at protecting oil and gas stakeholders from \"discrimination\" by BlackRock and other financial firms that are transitioning into renewable energy.\n\nThe purported goal of the legislation is to protect the public from financial risk related to renewable energy and other elements of \"ESG\" investing. However, the law of unintended consequences is also hard at work, with local governments losing millions on bond sales attributed since 2021 (for details, check out our ESG coverage and this handy ESG explainer from the Austin American-Statesman).\n\nTwo dozen or so other states have adopted similar measures along with follow-on legal action since 2021, and Texas has doubled down on its pursuit of BlackRock.\n\nThough BlackRock has a mixed record on the energy transition, the high-profile firm also emphasizes that climate change is a significant risk, reflecting the company's footprint in the sustainability funds area. That has made it the chief target of officials in Texas and other states who support anti-ESG legislation.\n\nIn the most recent news on that score, news dropped barely three months ago that Texas has booted BlackRock out of the $8.5 billion Texas Permanent School Fund.\n\nWhat, indeed? Why all the sudden hearts and flowers for BlackRock?\n\nAside from legislation applying to certain areas like ESG and abortion access, Texas lawmakers have acquired a broad reputation for deregulating anything that is possible to deregulate. That partly explains the attraction of setting up a new stock exchange there, if you are someone who favors deregulation, but it doesn't explain the new love affair with BlackRock.\n\nTo make things even a little more interesting, TXSE is not just for Texas. The goal is to establish a regional stock exchange for the Old South, or \"southeast quadrant of the U.S.,\" as TXSE prefers to call the US states that attempted to secede from the Union, with lethal results.\n\nTXSE lists Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee within the its purview (Virginia and Arkansas also tried to secede but are not include in TXSE's list).\n\nAnd, that's where things get even a little more interesting. Although most of the Southeastern states are represented in the anti-ESG movement, the region has also become a hotbed of investment in electric vehicle and EV battery manufacturing, among other elements of the renewable energy transition, partly due to \"right-to-work\" laws that have created a compliant pool of lower-wage labor. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act also favors investment in Texas and several other Southeast states.\n\nMeanwhile, the media chatter over TXSE has prompted comparisons with the state's grid manager ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. Unlike other parts of the US grid, ERCOT is untouched by federal rules that regulate interstate electricity, the result of a conscious decision by state lawmakers to avoid federal regulation.\n\nFederally regulated states can shift kilowatts around with their neighbors to balance the regional grid or respond to emergencies. But, not Texas. The Texas grid is almost entirely insulated from outside help.\n\nWith predictable consequences such as the notorious blackout of 2021 in mind, concerns have been raised over the ability of a Texas-based stock exchange to protect investors from fraud or rampant speculation, or both.\n\nThat remains to be seen. If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.\n\nOn the plus side, the comparison between TXSE and ERCOT is not all bad news. The \"island effect\" has motivated ERCOT to soak up every available in-state power generation resource. That includes an ever-growing stockpile of wind farms and solar arrays, on through a beehive of activity in e-fuels, green hydrogen, solid-state EV batteries, supercritical CO2, long duration energy storage, and other up-and-coming fields (see lots more stories here).\n\nOh the irony, it burns. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has made political hay by targeting BlackRock and other ESG-friendly financial firms for legislative attacks, but it seems that's all for show.\n\nTXSE Group Chairman and CEO James Lee hinted as much in an interview with the Dallas Morning News earlier this week. Lee told the Morning News that he \"gives a lot of credit for the planned launch to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who's long supported such an endeavor,\" as described by the business news publication Dallas Innovates.\n\nSo much for protecting fossil energy stakeholders. Between Texas and the Southeast states under the TXSE umbrella, CleanTechnica will expect a fresh torrent of renewable energy investing to rain down upon a region that is already benefiting from the combination of cheap labor, the IRA, and other Biden administration policies aimed at on-shoring the clean tech industry.\n\nAs for the Texas grid, keep an eye on a big play from the long distance transmission stakeholder Pattern Energy, which is laying plans to connect ERCOT and its copious wind and energy resources with neighboring Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\nFollow me @tinamcasey on

Texas Stock Exchange to File SEC Paperwork - Report", "body": "Texas continues its rise to prominence when other states are falling short.\n\nPlans are in motion for a new Dallas-based Texas Stock Exchange to officially launch in 2026, CNN reported.\n\nThe TXSE group will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later this year with over 24 investors and $120 million in capital. Chairman and CEO of TXSE James Lee posted on his Linkedin that investors will include names like BlackRock and Citadel Securities.\n\nTXSE is expected to have the most capital at launch of any exchange to file with the SEC, according to CNN and Lee's post.\n\nAccording to the TXSE website, \"Texas and the other states in the southeast quadrant of the U.S. lead the nation in economic expansion and population growth, making Texas the clear choice for the establishment of a new national securities exchange. For decades, Texas has been the nation's leader in attracting business relocations and expansions. It's home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state and more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies, many of which are preparing to access the public markets. In addition, there are more than 1,500 publicly traded companies throughout the region.\"\n\nWhile there is plenty to speculate on regarding markets, investments and the potential for private equity companies to go public, there is a notable trend with TXSE's creation that's been playing out now for several years: money leaving blue states and going to red states.\n\nIt's not exactly a well-kept secret that New York has not been the most welcoming or pro-business state in recent memory.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, New York lost nearly $1 trillion in asset management companies as 158 companies moved out of the state.\n\nThe Tax Foundation's \"2024 State Business Tax Climate Index\" ranked New York 49th for its tax system, only beating New Jersey.\n\nNew York City's vacant storefronts have nearly doubled since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams seemed more occupied with providing free food, free housing and pre-paid debit cards to illegal aliens than he is with fighting the state's precipitous downfall.\n\nThe city had plans in motion to give illegals spending money via cash cards in March as they threw out free food they didn't want.\n\nThe streets aren't welcoming, either. Whether you're a regular New Yorker at church or a famous actor like Steve Buscemi, it's not out of the ordinary to be the victim of a vicious assault while having the audacity to keep to yourself.\n\nWhile the regular person will surely make an exodus to greener pastures, companies are taking note as Texas now has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state, according to a July 2023 report by Texas Real Estate Source.\n\nWhile we shouldn't kid ourselves about TXSE's creation, as there are around 13 stock exchanges in the country, it does fit well in the broader trend playing out.\n\nWall Street is a hallmark of New York as the financial heartbeat of the country.\n\nWith its prosperity at stake, Texas' move should motivate the state to change its tune and flourish once more.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_short@westernjournal.com", "name": "Samuel Short", "type": "author",

The exchange has received $120 million in funding from investors such as BlackRock and Citadel Securities.\n\nThe exchange plans to file registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2024 and could begin trading in 2025. The exchange's backers want it to be more \"CEO-friendly\" amid new compliance costs and board diversity targets, according to WSJ, which added that it will be \"entirely electronic\" but will also have a \"physical presence\" in Dallas.\n\nAbbott on Wednesday expressed support for the exchange.\n\n\"Texas Poised for Its Own Stock Exchange: Promising Less Red Tape Than NYSE or Nasdaq. A place where the only agenda is capitalism,\" Abbott wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHis remarks sparked criticism from some conservatives over BlackRock's involvement. Conservatives have been critical of BlackRock over its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. ESG programs have become a sticking point for some on the right, who argue that companies that embrace them value social causes over shareholders' profits.\n\nIn fact, Abbott himself has been sharply critical of BlackRock. In 2021, he signed a bill banning financial companies with ESG policies, including BlackRock, from doing business in Texas.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Abbott's office for comment via email\n\n\"I am disappointed you believe a Texas stock exchange created by Blackrock is promising or even a close to a good idea for Texans,\" X user Paula Masters said.\n\nAnother user with more than 78,000 followers, @Arkypatriot, posted, \"Did you really say you're going into business with Blackrock?\"\n\nConservative filmmaker Leland Freeman posted, \"One little detail Governor Abbott is leaving out, Blackrock is the one that wants to build this stock market in Texas.\"\n\nOthers, however, praised the exchange.\n\n\"Silicone Valley is moving to Austin. Hollywood is moving to Ft. Worth. Wall Street is moving to Dallas. Texas is gonna get crazy, y'all,\" posted writer Ian Harber.\n\nAbbott has worked to attract more businesses to Texas throughout his tenure despite concerns from some companies about the state's stringent laws surrounding abortion.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are considered the two largest stock exchanges in the United States, but smaller exchanges exist in cities like Boston,

According to analysts, movements in the equity markets create an opening for competition as issuers and exchange-traded asset backers want greater certainty about listing protocols and expenses.\n\nThe new stock exchange will reportedly improve access to US capital markets, which includes better alignment for listed companies. According to PR Newswire, Lee stated:\n\nChanges in equities trading markets are driving more volume to exchanges and more choices for issuers and sponsors. TXSE will ultimately create more competition around quote activity, liquidity and transparency, resulting in more consistent and reliable markets that benefit investors, global issuers and liquidity providers alike.\n\nTexas, which boasts more Fortune 500 firms than other states, is a booming economic hub, and it seems to be the logical setting for a new US stock exchange.

The Wall Street Journal reported that BlackRock and Citadel have raised $120 million from investors to back the TXSE Group (Texas Stock Exchange), with plans to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in H2/24 and open for business sometime in 2025. The sales pitch of the TXSE to prospective companies is headlined by a focus on loosening the rules and regulations governing the listing and maintenance of companies on the exchange.\n\nMB BOTTOM-LINE: It's hard to say if this is just a sophisticated grift to ride the wave of \"anti-woke\" sentiment boiling up in the US in the runup to its big November 2024 election. Conservative groups (especially on X) have been loudly critical of new rules meant to enforce \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) measures, like the NASDAQ's new board diversity rule. That rule, which requires at least one board member to be female or of an \"underrepresented racial or ethnic minority, or LGBTQ+\" has become a lightning rod for \"culture war\" battles online. Just as it's hard to tell how much of the emotion is real and how much comes from engagement bots on X and other platforms, it's also hard for me to tell just how serious the anti-DEI stance of this potential new exchange would be. All I know is that there's a lot of value in competition at the stock market level. I don't love that the competition has to come wrapped in some cringe-worthy anti-woke messaging. Still, the TSXE's entrance could spark a new wave of listings or reveal innovations that are beneficial for companies and investors. I know most here in the Philippines would laugh at the thought of having a second stock exchange, given the relatively small size of our only existing stock exchange, but I think there's even more value to be had here with a second exchange that is independent of the PSE. Would that help break the hold of the Old Boys' Club? Hard to say. It could just make a new faction.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diversity, equity, and inclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citadel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manitoba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manitoba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New wave music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers_and_Routing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers and Routing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2021/11/17/stock-commentarymb_2021-11-17_08-59-59.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625670", "eventUri": "eng-9625670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

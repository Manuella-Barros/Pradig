{"id": 225048088, "title": "NFL Rumors: Chris Godwin, Bucs Haven't Discussed New Contract Entering Final Season", "text": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin is one of the team's most important offensive players, but it doesn't appear that a contract extension is on the horizon for him. According to ESPN's Jenna Laine, while Godwin is entering the final year of his contract in 2024, \"sources close to the situation\" said that \"talks on an extension have not started.\" Laine added that this offseason is important for Godwin because Tampa Bay plans to evaluate how he performs in the new offense being installed. \"The Bucs will want to see how he performs in Liam Coen's offense moving back to the inside, where Godwin saw a heavy amount of production in Bruce Arians' offense,\" Laine stated. Godwin shuffled between playing on the outside and in the slot last season. Despite some inconsistencies, he still recorded his third straight 1,000-yard campaign with 83 catches for 1,024 yards and two touchdowns. Still, the team expects him to be even more productive by focusing on a slot role in 2024. \"He's an inside guy by nature. He can play outside. But he can make a living inside doing a bunch of things for us. We plan to let him do a lot of things that he does best,\" head coach Todd Bowles said. \"He was coming off the injury last year, so I don't know if he was at full tilt inside or outside. But he looks a lot quicker, a lot lighter, and he's healthier now.\" The Bucs used a third-round pick in this year's draft to select wide receiver Jalen McMillan, so it will be important for Godwin to continue performing at a high level if he hopes to avoid being replaced in the offense and earn the long-term extension he deserves.", "summary": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin is one of the team's most important offensive players, but it doesn't appear that a contract extension is on\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10122875-nfl-rumors-chris-godwin-bucs-havent-discussed-new-contract-entering-final-season", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1716990025/tb7rn4kxwe3prxdodqvb.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:12:09", "author": "Doric Sam", "authors": ["Doric Sam"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.015}

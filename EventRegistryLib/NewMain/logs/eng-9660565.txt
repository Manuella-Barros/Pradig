Muslim pilgrims were wrapping up the Hajj pilgrimage in the deadly summer heat on Tuesday with the third day of the symbolic stoning of the devil, and the farewell circling around Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nHundreds of people died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom, officials said Wednesday as people tried to claim their loved ones' bodies.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died. However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in Al-Muaisem neighborhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility. The list offered no cause of death.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, the paper added.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the number of deaths to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil,\n\nAt the Grand Mosque in Mecca, temperatures reached 51.8 C (125 F) on Monday though pilgrims had already left for Mina, authorities said.\n\nOthers, including many Egyptians, lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man collapsed to the ground when he heard the name of mother among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling a travel agent, shouting: \"He left her to die!\" The crowd tried to calm the man.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for those bodies held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.",

A medic who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility. The list offered no cause of death.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, the paper added.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the number of deaths to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil.\n\nOthers, including many Egyptians, lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man collapsed to the ground when he heard the name of mother among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling a travel agent, shouting: \"He left her to die!\" The crowd tried to calm the man.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the cause of death at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's (PBUH) Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the Hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.",

However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in Al-Muaisem neighborhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility. The list offered no cause of death.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, the paper added.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the number of deaths to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil,\n\nMuslim pilgrims use umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun as they arrive to cast stones at pillars in the symbolic stoning of the devil, the last rite of the annual hajj, in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, June 18, 2024. Muslim pilgrims were wrapping up the Hajj pilgrimage in the deadly summer heat on Tuesday with the third day of the symbolic stoning of the devil, and the farewell circling around Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nAt the Grand Mosque in Mecca, temperatures reached 51.8 C (125 F) on Monday though pilgrims had already left for Mina, authorities said.\n\nOthers, including many Egyptians, lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man collapsed to the ground when he heard the name of mother among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling a travel agent, shouting: \"He left her to die!\" The crowd tried to calm the man.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for those bodies held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam\u00b4s holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca\u00b4s Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u00b4s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Muslim pilgrims were wrapping up the Hajj pilgrimage in the deadly summer heat on Tuesday with the third day of the symbolic stoning of the devil, and the farewell circling around Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque. Rafiq Maqbool/Associated Press\n\nMECCA, Saudi Arabia -- Hundreds of people died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom, officials said Wednesday as people tried to claim their loved ones' bodies.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died. However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in Al-Muaisem neighborhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility.\n\nDeaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over 2 million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" according to an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom save their entire lives for the pilgrimage and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, it said.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the fatalities to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKhalid Bashir Bazaz, an Indian pilgrim, speaking near the Grand Mosque on Wednesday, said he \"saw a lot of people collapsing to the ground unconscious\" during this year's Hajj.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Some people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil.\n\nMany Egyptians said they lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man broke down when he heard his mother was among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling their travel agent.\n\n\"He left her to die,\" he shouted, referring to the agent. The crowd tried to calm him down.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for the people whose bodies were held at the complex.

Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil,\n\nAt the Grand Mosque in Mecca, temperatures reached 51.8 C (125 F) on Monday though pilgrims had already left for Mina, authorities said.\n\nA pilgrim offer prayers after she cast stones at a pillar in the symbolic stoning of the devil, the last rite of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man collapsed to the ground when he heard the name of his mother among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling a travel agent, shouting: \"He left her to die!\" The crowd tried to calm the man.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for those bodies held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nMuslim pilgrims rest after casting stones at pillars in the symbolic stoning of the devil, the last rite of the annual hajj, in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.",

However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in Al-Muaisem neighborhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility.\n\nDeaths aren't uncommon at the hajj, which has drawn at times over 2 million people to Saudi Arabia. There have been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, the paper added.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the number of deaths to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil,\n\nAt the Grand Mosque in Mecca, temperatures reached 51.8 C (125 F) on Monday though pilgrims had already left for Mina, authorities said.\n\nOthers, including many Egyptians, lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man collapsed to the ground when he heard the name of mother among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling a travel agent, shouting: \"He left her to die!\" The crowd tried to calm the man.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for those bodies held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died. However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nAt least 550 Die During 5-Day Hajj\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility.\n\nThe list offered no cause of death. Each year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said.\n\nCommunicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, the paper added.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the number of deaths to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nMecca Touches 47 Degrees Celsius\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil,\n\nOthers, including many Egyptians, lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nMan Collapses After Learning Mother's Death Due To Heatwave\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man collapsed to the ground when he heard the name of his mother among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling a travel agent, shouting: \"He left her to die!\" The crowd tried to calm the man.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nOver 600 Indian Nationals Succumb to Heat\n\n68 Indian nationals died during the hajj pilgrimage this year marked by searing heat, bringing the overall tally to more than 600.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the cause of death at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater.\n\nA 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede.\n\nA separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people. The second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.

However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in Al-Muaisem neighborhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility.\n\nDeaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over 2 million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" according to an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom save their entire lives for the pilgrimage and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, it said.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the fatalities to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nKhalid Bashir Bazaz, an Indian pilgrim, speaking near the Grand Mosque on Wednesday, said he \"saw a lot of people collapsing to the ground unconscious\" during this year's Hajj.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Some people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil.\n\nMany Egyptians said they lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man broke down when he heard his mother was among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling their travel agent.\n\n\"He left her to die,\" he shouted, referring to the agent. The crowd tried to calm him down.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for the people whose bodies were held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. By 2029, the Hajj will occur in April, and in the next several years after that it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, according to an AP count. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster that same year, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nOne list circulating online suggested at least 550 people died during the five-day Hajj. A medic who spoke to The Associated Press (AP) on condition of anonymity to discuss information not released publicly by the government, said that the names listed appeared genuine. That medic and another official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believed at least 600 bodies were at the facility.\n\nDeaths aren't uncommon at the Hajj, which has drawn at times over two million people to Saudi Arabia. There have been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history.\n\nEach year, the Hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre- Hajj healthcare,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips, and can be elderly with pre-existing health conditions, the paper added.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the number of deaths to swell. Already, several countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology.

Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.",

The pictures and videos show people who were undertaking their once-in-a-lifetime Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca collapsed on the side of the road or slumped in wheelchairs, apparently close to death or dead. They are dressed in traditional pilgrim's white, their faces covered with cloths. In several pictures, corpses appear to have been left where they presumably collapsed.\n\nWhat started as a rumor on social media was confirmed as the weeklong Hajj pilgrimage ended: Hundreds of pilgrims have died in Saudi Arabia, evidently due to extremely high temperatures and lack of shelter or water.\n\nTemperatures in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, rose to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) during the course of the annual event, which started late last week.\n\nAround 1.8 million Muslims from all over the world had been expected in Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj. One of the world's largest religious gatherings, the Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Every Muslim who is able to is supposed to perform it at least once in their lifetime.\n\nSources in the Saudi Arabian Health Ministry told Reuters news agency they had recorded 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion.\" But they had been speaking before reports of deaths began to emerge. The country has not updated official statistics since then.\n\nAccording to AFP news agency, which has been tallying up fatalities via different sources and countries over the past few days, the death toll has topped 1,000.\n\nPilgrims from Egypt, Indonesia, Senegal, Jordan, Iran, Iraq, India and Tunisia have all died, their governments reported. A large number, likely over 300, came from Egypt. The Indonesian Health Ministry also reported over 140 nationals' deaths.\n\nOver the past years, Saudi authorities have tried to take measures to mitigate the impact of high summer temperatures on visitors by providing things like misting stations and water dispensers. Nevertheless, it is thought that most of the recent deaths are likely heat-related. Many of the pilgrims who perform Hajj are elderly, as undertaking the Hajj is something they want to do before they die.\n\nThe death toll may continue to rise. Friends and families are still searching Saudi hospitals or putting out calls for help on social media to try to find loved ones who arrived in Mecca but who are now missing.\n\n\"Honestly, Hajj this year was shameful,\" Ihlsa, a pilgrim from Aswan, in southern Egypt, who preferred not to give her full name, told DW via WhatsApp. \"It was very difficult, especially during the stoning. People were just collapsed on the ground.\"\n\nPart of the Hajj ritual involves pilgrims throwing stones at three walls, a symbolic form of \"stoning the devil.\"\n\n\"Several times I told the security personnel about a pilgrim who had fallen onto the ground,\" Ihlsa said. \"The distance to throw the stones was really too far and at the same time the sun was high, and it was so hot.\"\n\nIn the pilgrims' home countries, a furious debate is taking place about who is to blame.\n\nTo do the Hajj, pilgrims need to have official permission from Saudi Arabia to enter the country. Because more Muslims want to come than there is space for, Saudi Arabia runs a quota system every year. Overcrowding and overheating have been serious problems in the past.\n\nThe trip to Saudi Arabia is usually facilitated by travel agencies, often linked to Muslim community organizations or mosques back home. They organize accommodation, food and transport in Mecca. Registered pilgrims will likely be part of a mission or camp in Mecca run by those travel agents.\n\nSome victim's families are blaming the Saudi authorities or the authorities of their own countries for not being organized enough or failing to provide enough shelter from the extreme heat.\n\nOthers have blamed those who arrived in Mecca unregistered. More than 171,000 unregistered pilgrims were identified as being in the country before Hajj began, Saudi Director of Public Security Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Bassami said earlier in the week. Saudi security services had previously launched a campaign to arrest anybody doing the Hajj illicitly.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims cannot access the same kinds of facilities -- air conditioning, water, shade, and misting or cooling centers -- that registered pilgrims can, which may have also caused casualties.\n\nDW spoke with a manager from a private Egyptian tour company who has been bringing Egyptian pilgrims to Mecca for several years now and who was in Saudi Arabia this week. The manager wouldn't give his name because he was not supposed to speak to media.\n\n\"The temperatures were high and people were noncompliant and also unaware [of how dangerous the heat was],\" he told DW by phone. \"Everyone just did what they wanted to and the whole thing was badly organized. Additionally there were not enough tents for everybody.\"\n\nThere definitely wasn't a stampede though, he said. \"People were happy to stand on Mount Arafat,\" he recounted.\n\n\"My point of view is that when people realized how hot it was and how intense the sun was, they should have avoided going up to the top,\" the pilgrimage manager explained, adding that many pilgrims don't realize you can simply stand on a lower slope to perform the ritual.\n\n\"Pilgrims need to be better educated and more aware,\" he continued. \"The state absolutely has obligations and bears responsibility. But the behavior of some [of the pilgrims] indicated a lack of awareness. And by that, I mean awareness regarding how to perform Hajj rituals. For example, the [Saudi] state is not able to place sunshades on the top of Mount Arafat.\"\n\nWhile the recriminations and the desperate pleas for help continue, one thing is certain: The Hajj is only going to get hotter.\n\nA 2019 study that asked whether Saudi attempts to cool down pilgrims during Hajj were successful concluded that while official measures did help, there was no escaping the fact that climate change was going to make the Hajj hotter, and therefore more dangerous, every year.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [],

The pictures and videos show people who were undertaking their once-in-a-lifetime Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca collapsed on the side of the road or slumped in wheelchairs, apparently close to death or dead. They are dressed in traditional pilgrim's white, their faces covered with cloths. In several pictures, corpses appear to have been left where they presumably collapsed.\n\nWhat started as a rumor on social media was confirmed as the weeklong Hajj pilgrimage ended: Hundreds of pilgrims have died in Saudi Arabia, evidently due to extremely high temperatures and lack of shelter or water.\n\nTemperatures in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, rose to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) during the course of the annual event, which started late last week.\n\nAround 1.8 million Muslims from all over the world had been expected in Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj. One of the world's largest religious gatherings, the Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Every Muslim who is able to is supposed to perform it at least once in their lifetime.\n\nSources in the Saudi Arabian Health Ministry told Reuters news agency they had recorded 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion.\" But they had been speaking before reports of deaths began to emerge. The country has not updated official statistics since then.\n\nAccording to AFP news agency, which has been tallying up fatalities via different sources and countries over the past few days, the death toll has topped 1,000.\n\nPilgrims from Egypt, Indonesia, Senegal, Jordan, Iran, Iraq, India and Tunisia have all died, their governments reported. A large number, likely over 300, came from Egypt. The Indonesian Health Ministry also reported over 140 nationals' deaths.\n\nOver the past years, Saudi authorities have tried to take measures to mitigate the impact of high summer temperatures on visitors by providing things like misting stations and water dispensers. Nevertheless, it is thought that most of the recent deaths are likely heat-related. Many of the pilgrims who perform Hajj are elderly, as undertaking the Hajj is something they want to do before they die.\n\nDesperate search for missing\n\nThe death toll may continue to rise. Friends and families are still searching Saudi hospitals or putting out calls for help on social media to try to find loved ones who arrived in Mecca but who are now missing.\n\n\"Honestly, Hajj this year was shameful,\" Ihlsa, a pilgrim from Aswan, in southern Egypt, who preferred not to give her full name, told DW via WhatsApp. \"It was very difficult, especially during the stoning.

Muslim pilgrims were wrapping up the Hajj pilgrimage in the deadly summer heat on Tuesday with the third day of the symbolic stoning of the devil, and the farewell circling around Kaaba in Mecca\n\nREPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA -- The Saudi Arabian authority confirmed that most pilgrims who passed away during the current Hajj season were not part of their national Hajj delegation and came without a proper Hajj permit.\n\nSaudi's Ministry of Media explained that those individuals entered Saudi Arabia on tourism or visit visas months before the Hajj rituals began.\n\n\"These individuals remained in Mecca until the Hajj season and performed the pilgrimage without proper authorization,\" the Saudi ministry noted as per the statement received here on Thursday.\n\nThe Tunisian Foreign Ministry confirmed that most of their pilgrims who passed away while performing Hajj this year had arrived in Saudi Arabia not with a Hajj visa but only on a tourism, visit, or Umrah visa.\n\nLikewise, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry also reported that all Jordanian pilgrims who died or went missing were not part of the official Jordanian Hajj delegation, according to the Saudi ministry.\n\nThe Saudi authority confirmed that this year's Hajj season was marked by a significant increase in temperatures in Mecca, reaching 45 degrees Celsius.\n\nHowever, as the pilgrims were performing Hajj without proper authorization, they could not access the accommodation, food, or transportation services afforded to Hajj pilgrims to help them mitigate the effects of high temperatures.\n\n\"Consequently, they were exposed to the risks of heat exhaustion, sun exposure, and long (periods of) walking on rugged, unpaved paths not designated for pedestrians,\" according to the Saudi ministry.\n\n\"These conditions led to the unfortunate deaths of many.

Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for those bodies held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year.

The mass migration is unparalleled in scale, and pilgrims face numerous health hazards.\n\nMecca is considered the holiest city for Muslims. And Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, making it a mandatory religious duty for Muslims to perform at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially capable.\n\nThe 2024 Hajj pilgrimage has been overshadowed by disaster/tragedy, with the death of at least 900 pilgrims, mostly due to heat exhaustion and related complications.\n\nOne of the most devastating incidents occurred in 2015 during the ritual of \"Rami al-Jamarat\" in Mina, near Mecca. This ritual involves pilgrims throwing stones at pillars symbolizing the devil. On that day, overcrowding and the movement of large groups of pilgrims in opposite directions led to a deadly crowd crush. More than 2,400 pilgrims lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest disasters in the history of Hajj or any mass gathering.\n\nAnother mass casualty event occurred in 1990, in the Al-Ma'aisem pedestrian tunnel near Mecca, which led to the holy sites. A combination of ventilation failure and an enormous influx of pilgrims caused a suffocating crush inside the tunnel; 1,426 pilgrims died.\n\nThere have also been other incidents during the Hajj pilgrimage over the years. In 1994, a stampede near the Jamarat Bridge resulted in the deaths of around 270 pilgrims. The 1998 Hajj saw 118 pilgrims killed in another stampede.\n\nOver the past half-century, more than 9,000 people have died in mass religious gatherings, with more than 5,000 of these occurring during the Hajj in Saudi Arabia. India follows with at least 2,200 deaths across nearly 40 tragic events. These two countries are hotspots for such tragedies.\n\nWith millions of pilgrims converging in a confined area, the potential for overcrowding and crowd-crush accidents is high. This situation is worsened by the high emotion and passion associated with the pilgrimage. Pilgrims perform rituals with intense devotion and enthusiasm, which can sometimes lead to overexertion.\n\nAnother factor is the age of the pilgrims. Many are elderly, having saved for years to afford this spiritual journey. Their advanced age makes them particularly vulnerable to the harsh conditions and physical demands of the pilgrimage. The intense heat, prolonged periods of walking, and sheer physical strain of performing the rituals can exacerbate existing health issues and lead to new complications.\n\nThe extreme congestion of people also amplifies health risks, particularly from infectious diseases. Communicable diseases such as SARS, avian influenza and meningococcal disease have posed significant threats during Hajj in the past.\n\nA study documenting deaths and injuries at mass gatherings up to 2019 shows that, while the 1980s saw most fatalities at sporting events, such events are now rare, while fatalities during religious pilgrimages, particularly in India and Saudi Arabia, are becoming more common.\n\nWhile most Hajj fatalities have been due to crowd crushes and stampedes, a new threat has emerged: extreme climate. Saudi Arabia's climate can be brutal. During this year's pilgrimage, temperatures soared to 50\u00b0C.\n\nSaudi Arabia is warming at a rate 50% higher than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. The decade from 2010 to 2019 was the warmest on record, with more frequent and severe heat waves. This rising temperature, combined with higher humidity, makes conditions increasingly unbearable without artificial cooling.\n\nThe timing of the Hajj pilgrimage, dictated by the lunar Islamic calendar, means it shifts approximately 10 to 11 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar. This means Hajj can occur in different seasons over a 33-year cycle. Currently, Hajj is being held during the summer months, leading to extreme heat risks.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also experienced an increase in extreme rainfall events in recent years, particularly towards the end of summer and into the fall. These torrential downpours and thunderstorms have caused significant flooding in regions such as Mecca and Jeddah.\n\nAs climate patterns continue to evolve, the occurrence of such rainfall could align with the Hajj season, creating additional hazards for pilgrims.\n\nUnlike concerts or sporting events, the Hajj pilgrimage cannot be rescheduled or relocated. Being outdoors is an integral part of Hajj.\n\nIt's crucial for pilgrims to perform the Hajj rituals correctly for their pilgrimage to be accepted. According to Islamic teachings, the Hajj must be conducted with precise adherence to its rituals and timings. Any deviation or omission can render the pilgrimage invalid.\n\nYet the extreme heat proved overwhelming, indicating more needs to be done. Educational campaigns can do more to raise awareness among (especially non-local) pilgrims and health-care workers about heat risks and preventive measures.\n\nThe introduction of new technologies such as smart bracelets for monitoring pilgrims' health could further enhance medical responses.", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stampede", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stampede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crowd collapses and crushes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Five Pillars of Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SARS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaraat_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaraat Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidents_during_the_Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incidents during the Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/mecca.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660565", "eventUri": "eng-9660565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

There have also been stampedes and epidemics throughout the pilgrimage's history.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the fatalities to swell. A local diplomat told reporters 'All of them died because of heat' except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, while Saudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress over the weekend.\n\nTemperatures at the Grand Mosque in Mecca hit 51.8C on Monday, according to the Saudi national meteorology centre.\n\nAFP journalists following the Hajj on Monday also reported seeing pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice-cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSpeaking near the Grand Mosque on Wednesday, Khalid Bashir Bazaz, an Indian pilgrim, said he 'saw a lot of people collapsing to the ground unconscious' in Mecca as people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil.\n\nSaudi officials have attempted to curb the casualties by advising pilgrims to use umbrellas, avoid exposure to the sun and drink plenty of water as they make the pilgrimage.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nMany Egyptians said they lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related, but on Tuesday, a diplomat tried to downplay the scale of the event by claiming the death toll had been boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an 'extreme danger threshold' from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, according to an AP count. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster that same year, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites.\n\nLike Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_sanders@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Sanders", "type": "author",

It started a day after pilgrims congregated Saturday at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat.\n\nThe final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday when Muslims with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThe Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured.

Dozens, including 14 from Jordan, were also reported dead.\n\nAfter the symbolic stoning, pilgrims head to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" or circumambulation, circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber tomb is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2014 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a

Climate change has made the Hajj pilgrimage more risky", "body": "UNSW Sydney provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU.\n\nEach year, millions of Muslims from across the world embark on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The mass migration is unparalleled in scale, and pilgrims face numerous health hazards.\n\nMecca is considered the holiest city for Muslims. And Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, making it a mandatory religious duty for Muslims to perform at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially capable.\n\nThe 2024 Hajj pilgrimage has been overshadowed by disaster/tragedy, with the death of at least 900 pilgrims, mostly due to heat exhaustion and related complications.\n\nThis isn't the first deadly disaster during Hajj\n\nOne of the most devastating incidents occurred in 2015 during the ritual of \"Rami al-Jamarat\" in Mina, near Mecca. This ritual involves pilgrims throwing stones at pillars symbolising the devil. On that day, overcrowding and the movement of large groups of pilgrims in opposite directions led to a deadly crowd crush. More than 2,400 pilgrims lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest disasters in the history of Hajj or any mass gathering.\n\nAnother mass casualty event occurred in 1990, in the Al-Ma'aisem pedestrian tunnel near Mecca, which led to the holy sites. A combination of ventilation failure and an enormous influx of pilgrims caused a suffocating crush inside the tunnel; 1,426 pilgrims died.\n\nThere have also been other incidents during the Hajj pilgrimage over the years. In 1994, a stampede near the Jamarat Bridge resulted in the deaths of around 270 pilgrims. The 1998 Hajj saw 118 pilgrims killed in another stampede.\n\nOver the past half-century, more than 9,000 people have died in mass religious gatherings, with more than 5,000 of these occurring during the Hajj in Saudi Arabia. India follows with at least 2,200 deaths across nearly 40 tragic events. These two countries are hotspots for such tragedies.\n\nWhy is the Hajj pilgrimage so risky?\n\nWith millions of pilgrims converging in a confined area, the potential for overcrowding and crowd-crush accidents is high. This situation is worsened by the high emotion and passion associated with the pilgrimage. Pilgrims perform rituals with intense devotion and enthusiasm, which can sometimes lead to overexertion.\n\nAnother factor is the age of the pilgrims. Many are elderly, having saved for years to afford this spiritual journey. Their advanced age makes them particularly vulnerable to the harsh conditions and physical demands of the pilgrimage. The intense heat, prolonged periods of walking, and sheer physical strain of performing the rituals can exacerbate existing health issues and lead to new complications.\n\nThe extreme congestion of people also amplifies health risks, particularly from infectious diseases. Communicable diseases such as SARS, avian influenza and meningococcal disease have posed significant threats during Hajj in the past.\n\nHigh temperatures make mass gatherings riskier\n\nA study documenting deaths and injuries at mass gatherings up to 2019 shows that, while the 1980s saw most fatalities at sporting events, such events are now rare, while fatalities during religious pilgrimages, particularly in India and Saudi Arabia, are becoming more common.\n\nWhile most Hajj fatalities have been due to crowd crushes and stampedes, a new threat has emerged: extreme climate. Saudi Arabia's climate can be brutal. During this year's pilgrimage, temperatures soared to 50\u00b0C.\n\nSaudi Arabia is warming at a rate 50% higher than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. The decade from 2010 to 2019 was the warmest on record, with more frequent and severe heatwaves. This rising temperature, combined with higher humidity, makes conditions increasingly unbearable without artificial cooling.\n\nThe timing of the Hajj pilgrimage, dictated by the lunar Islamic calendar, means it shifts approximately 10 to 11 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar. This means Hajj can occur in different seasons over a 33-year cycle. Currently, Hajj is being held during the summer months, leading to extreme heat risks.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also experienced an increase in extreme rainfall events in recent years, particularly towards the end of summer and into the fall. These torrential downpours and thunderstorms have caused significant flooding in regions such as Mecca and Jeddah.\n\nAs climate patterns continue to evolve, the occurrence of such rainfall could align with the Hajj season, creating additional hazards for pilgrims.\n\nWhat can be done to mitigate the risks?\n\nUnlike concerts or sporting events, the Hajj pilgrimage cannot be rescheduled or relocated. Being outdoors is an integral part of Hajj.\n\nIt's crucial for pilgrims to perform the Hajj rituals correctly for their pilgrimage to be accepted. According to Islamic teachings, the Hajj must be conducted with precise adherence to its rituals and timings. Any deviation or omission can render the pilgrimage invalid.\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Health has implemented various measures, including encouraging vaccinations, health checks and educational campaigns urging pilgrims to stay hydrated, use umbrellas and avoid prolonged sun exposure.\n\nThe ministry deployed thousands of paramedics and set up field hospitals to manage the crisis. Cooling measures such as misting systems and portable water stations were used.\n\nYet the extreme heat proved overwhelming, indicating more needs to be done. Educational campaigns can do more to raise awareness among (especially non-local) pilgrims and health-care workers about heat risks and preventive measures.\n\nThe introduction of new technologies such as smart bracelets for monitoring pilgrims' health could further enhance medical responses.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors":

It started a day after pilgrims congregated Saturday at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat.\n\nThe final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday when Muslims with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThe Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual. \"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather remained Tuesday, with temperatures, expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, were seen collapsed and in need of medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens, including 14 from Jordan, were also reported dead.\n\nAfter the symbolic stoning, pilgrims head to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" or circumambulation, circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber tomb is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2014 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict.\n\n\"I prayed first for Gaza then Yemen,\" said al-Mehrabi, the Yemeni pilgrim, referring to the war between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian enclave and the decade-old conflict in his home country.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samy_magdy@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Samy Magdy", "type":

Climate change has made the Hajj pilgrimage more risky", "body": "Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Milad Haghani, Senior Lecturer of Urban Mobility, Public Safety & Disaster Risk, UNSW Sydney\n\nEach year, millions of Muslims from across the world embark on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The mass migration is unparalleled in scale, and pilgrims face numerous health hazards.\n\nMecca is considered the holiest city for Muslims. And Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, making it a mandatory religious duty for Muslims to perform at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially capable.\n\nThe 2024 Hajj pilgrimage has been overshadowed by disaster/tragedy, with the death of at least 900 pilgrims, mostly due to heat exhaustion and related complications.\n\nThis isn't the first deadly disaster during Hajj\n\nOne of the most devastating incidents occurred in 2015 during the ritual of \"Rami al-Jamarat\" in Mina, near Mecca. This ritual involves pilgrims throwing stones at pillars symbolising the devil. On that day, overcrowding and the movement of large groups of pilgrims in opposite directions led to a deadly crowd crush. More than 2,400 pilgrims lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest disasters in the history of Hajj or any mass gathering.\n\nAnother mass casualty event occurred in 1990, in the Al-Ma'aisem pedestrian tunnel near Mecca, which led to the holy sites. A combination of ventilation failure and an enormous influx of pilgrims caused a suffocating crush inside the tunnel; 1,426 pilgrims died.\n\nThere have also been other incidents during the Hajj pilgrimage over the years. In 1994, a stampede near the Jamarat Bridge resulted in the deaths of around 270 pilgrims. The 1998 Hajj saw 118 pilgrims killed in another stampede.\n\nOver the past half-century, more than 9,000 people have died in mass religious gatherings, with more than 5,000 of these occurring during the Hajj in Saudi Arabia. India follows with at least 2,200 deaths across nearly 40 tragic events. These two countries are hotspots for such tragedies.\n\nWhy is the Hajj pilgrimage so risky?\n\nWith millions of pilgrims converging in a confined area, the potential for overcrowding and crowd-crush accidents is high. This situation is worsened by the high emotion and passion associated with the pilgrimage. Pilgrims perform rituals with intense devotion and enthusiasm, which can sometimes lead to overexertion.\n\nAnother factor is the age of the pilgrims. Many are elderly, having saved for years to afford this spiritual journey. Their advanced age makes them particularly vulnerable to the harsh conditions and physical demands of the pilgrimage. The intense heat, prolonged periods of walking, and sheer physical strain of performing the rituals can exacerbate existing health issues and lead to new complications.\n\nThe extreme congestion of people also amplifies health risks, particularly from infectious diseases. Communicable diseases such as SARS, avian influenza and meningococcal disease have posed significant threats during Hajj in the past.\n\nHigh temperatures make mass gatherings riskier\n\nA study documenting deaths and injuries at mass gatherings up to 2019 shows that, while the 1980s saw most fatalities at sporting events, such events are now rare, while fatalities during religious pilgrimages, particularly in India and Saudi Arabia, are becoming more common.\n\nWhile most Hajj fatalities have been due to crowd crushes and stampedes, a new threat has emerged: extreme climate. Saudi Arabia's climate can be brutal. During this year's pilgrimage, temperatures soared to 50\u00b0C.\n\nSaudi Arabia is warming at a rate 50% higher than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. The decade from 2010 to 2019 was the warmest on record, with more frequent and severe heatwaves. This rising temperature, combined with higher humidity, makes conditions increasingly unbearable without artificial cooling.\n\nThe timing of the Hajj pilgrimage, dictated by the lunar Islamic calendar, means it shifts approximately 10 to 11 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar. This means Hajj can occur in different seasons over a 33-year cycle. Currently, Hajj is being held during the summer months, leading to extreme heat risks.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also experienced an increase in extreme rainfall events in recent years, particularly towards the end of summer and into the fall. These torrential downpours and thunderstorms have caused significant flooding in regions such as Mecca and Jeddah.\n\nAs climate patterns continue to evolve, the occurrence of such rainfall could align with the Hajj season, creating additional hazards for pilgrims.\n\nWhat can be done to mitigate the risks?\n\nUnlike concerts or sporting events, the Hajj pilgrimage cannot be rescheduled or relocated. Being outdoors is an integral part of Hajj.\n\nIt's crucial for pilgrims to perform the Hajj rituals correctly for their pilgrimage to be accepted. According to Islamic teachings, the Hajj must be conducted with precise adherence to its rituals and timings. Any deviation or omission can render the pilgrimage invalid.\n\nYet the extreme heat proved overwhelming, indicating more needs to be done.\n\nEducational campaigns can do more to raise awareness among (especially non-local) pilgrims and health-care workers about heat risks and preventive measures.\n\nThe introduction of new technologies such as smart bracelets for monitoring pilgrims' health could further enhance medical responses.\n\nMilad Haghani receives funding from The Australian Research Council.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

Saudi Arabia's climate can be brutal. During this year's pilgrimage, temperatures soared to 50\u00b0C.\n\nSaudi Arabia is warming at a rate 50% higher than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. The decade from 2010 to 2019 was the warmest on record, with more frequent and severe heatwaves. This rising temperature, combined with higher humidity, makes conditions increasingly unbearable without artificial cooling.\n\nThe timing of the Hajj pilgrimage, dictated by the lunar Islamic calendar, means it shifts approximately 10 to 11 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar. This means Hajj can occur in different seasons over a 33-year cycle. Currently, Hajj is being held during the summer months, leading to extreme heat risks.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also experienced an increase in extreme rainfall events in recent years, particularly towards the end of summer and into the fall. These torrential downpours and thunderstorms have caused significant flooding in regions such as Mecca and Jeddah.\n\nAs climate patterns continue to evolve, the occurrence of such rainfall could align with the Hajj season, creating additional hazards for pilgrims.\n\nWhat can be done to mitigate the risks?\n\nUnlike concerts or sporting events, the Hajj pilgrimage cannot be rescheduled or relocated. Being outdoors is an integral part of Hajj.\n\nIt's crucial for pilgrims to perform the Hajj rituals correctly for their pilgrimage to be accepted. According to Islamic teachings, the Hajj must be conducted with precise adherence to its rituals and timings. Any deviation or omission can render the pilgrimage invalid.\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Health has implemented various measures, including encouraging vaccinations, health checks and educational campaigns urging pilgrims to stay hydrated, use umbrellas and avoid prolonged sun exposure.\n\nThe ministry deployed thousands of paramedics and set up field hospitals to manage the crisis. Cooling measures such as misting systems and portable water stations were used.\n\nYet the extreme heat proved overwhelming, indicating more needs to be done. Educational campaigns can do more to raise awareness among (especially non-local) pilgrims and health-care workers about heat risks and preventive measures.\n\nThe introduction of new technologies such as smart bracelets for monitoring pilgrims' health could further enhance medical responses.\n\nMilad Haghani receives funding from The Australian Research Council.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nMuslim pilgrims have wrapped up the Hajj, or pilgrimage, in the deadly summer heat on Tuesday with the third day of the symbolic stoning of the devil, and the last circumambulation around the Kaaba, Islam's holiest site, in the city of Mecca.\n\nThe three-day stoning ritual in Mina, a desert site outside Mecca, is among the final rites of the Hajj, and symbolizes the casting away of evil and sin. It started a day after pilgrims congregated Saturday at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat.\n\nThe final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday when Muslims with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nHEATWAVE SHUTTERS ACROPOLIS IN ATHENS FOR SECOND CONSECUTIVE AFTERNOON\n\nThe Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual. \"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\"\n\nNigerian pilgrim Amir Omar was overjoyed once he finished his symbolic stoning. \"I am feeling very great that I perform one pillar of my religion,\" he said. \"I am feeling very grateful.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather remained Tuesday, with temperatures, expected to reach 116.6 degrees Fahrenheit in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, were seen collapsed and in need of medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens were also reported dead from sunstroke. They included at least 41 Jordanian pilgrims who will be buried in Saudi Arabia, according to Jordan's Foreign Ministry.\n\nMany other pilgrims couldn't be accounted for while performing the rituals. Many Egyptians took to social medial to search for their relatives in Mount Arafat and Mina. Some were found in hospitals around Mecca after collapsing from the heatwave.\n\nAfter the third symbolic stoning Tuesday, pilgrims headed to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 210 miles away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber tomb is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2014 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I prayed first for Gaza then Yemen,\" said al-Mehrabi, the Yemeni pilgrim, referring to the war between Israel and Hamas in the

This article explores the devastating impact of the extreme heat on Hajj travel, the ongoing effects of climate change, and the measures taken to protect pilgrims.\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam, requiring all Muslims who are physically and financially capable to make the journey at least once in their lifetime. The event attracts millions of pilgrims from around the world, who gather in Mecca to perform a series of religious rites over several days. This year, the pilgrimage coincided with Saudi Arabia's intense summer heat, exacerbating the risks for participants.\n\nPerforming Hajj during the sweltering Saudi summer poses numerous challenges for pilgrims, many of whom are elderly and frail. The pilgrimage involves long hours of walking and standing in open areas, making it difficult to avoid the scorching sun and maintain adequate hydration.\n\nKey Challenges Faced by Pilgrims:\n\nClimate change is significantly impacting weather patterns around the globe, and Saudi Arabia is no exception. Rising temperatures and increasing frequency of extreme heat events are making the Hajj pilgrimage more perilous each year.\n\nClimate Change Factors:\n\nThe Saudi Arabian government and various organizations have invested heavily in infrastructure and services to protect pilgrims during Hajj. Despite these efforts, the extreme heat remains a formidable challenge.\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, the future of Hajj will increasingly depend on the ability to adapt to extreme weather conditions. Ensuring the safety and well-being of pilgrims will require ongoing efforts and innovations.\n\nThe devastating heatwave during this year's Hajj pilgrimage underscores the profound impact of climate change on global travel and religious practices. As temperatures continue to rise, ensuring the safety and well-being of pilgrims in Mecca and other destinations becomes increasingly challenging.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAs we reflect on the challenges faced during this year's Hajj, it is clear that addressing the impacts of climate change and protecting vulnerable populations must be a priority for the global community.

Additionally, at least 41 Jordanians, 35 Tunisians and 11 Iranians have died, according to authorities in each country.\n\nA further 22 Jordanians are missing and 26 Iranians have been hospitalized, the Iranian Red Crescent said Wednesday, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nSome of the Iranians died due to heatstroke while others had underlying conditions, the Iranian Red Crescent said.\n\nThe death toll is likely to rise, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt have yet to release official figures. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country's quota - more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims.\n\nThe Saudi government said on Monday that more than 2,700 people had been treated for heatstroke. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for.\n\nMore than 1.8 million people are taking part in this year's Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics.\n\nWhile deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year's gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures.\n\nHajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHajj officials have asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part.\n\nPerforming Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life.\n\nThe pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil.\n\nThe Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia's king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam's holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy.\n\nSoon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\nExperts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage's economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.\n\nPilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The three-day stoning ritual in Mina, a desert site outside Mecca, is among the final rites of the Hajj, and symbolizes the casting away of evil and sin.\n\nIt started a day after pilgrims congregated Saturday at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat. The final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday when Muslims with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThe Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared. \"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual.\n\n\"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\" Nigerian pilgrim Amir Omar was overjoyed once he finished his symbolic stoning. \"I am feeling very great that I perform one pillar of my religion,\" he said. \"I am feeling very grateful.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather remained Tuesday, with temperatures, expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, were seen collapsed and in need of medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens, including 14 from Jordan, were also reported dead. After the third symbolic stoning Tuesday, pilgrims headed to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times.\n\nThat circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city. Once the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal. Most of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber tomb is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2024 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict. \"I prayed first for Gaza then Yemen,\" said al-Mehrabi, the Yemeni pilgrim, referring to the war between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian enclave and the decade-old conflict in his home country.", "source": {"uri":

AFP\n\nIndividuals with relatives missing in Mecca, Medina, and the holy pilgrimage sites, or those seeking repatriation of deceased relatives, are advised to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThey can head directly to the ministry's headquarters at 7 Lazoghly Street, first floor in Cairo's Garden City district, Isis building.\n\nThey can reach the operations room through the following phone numbers: (27923050 - 27923060 - 27942782 - 01006638814).\n\nThis year's Hajj season has witnessed the deaths of at least 550 pilgrims, including 323 Egyptians, due to sweltering temperatures, diplomats told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Tuesday.\n\nThe bodies of the victims are currently held in the hospital morgue in Mecca.\n\nMeanwhile, an AFP tally estimates the number of victims from multiple countries at 577 as of Tuesday.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said.\n\nThe Hajj this year, 1445 AH, is being performed by nearly 2 million pilgrims amid scorching heat. Temperatures neared 52 degrees Celsius in Mecca on Monday, according to Saudi Arabia's National Center for Meteorology (NCM).\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP said the presence of a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims during this season has \"absolutely\" contributed to the Egyptian death toll as this led to the collapse of provided services.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's Hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\" They died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nSaudi Arabia annually develops major works to provide cooling systems and air-conditioned facilities and tents for Hajj pilgrims in Mecca and other holy sites.\n\nSaudi officials have also advised pilgrims to stick to umbrellas, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid exposure to direct sun during the hottest hours of the day whenever possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi authorities have boosted their efforts in fighting unregistered Hajj and officials said that they have cleared over 300,000 pilgrims from Mecca due to not possessing Hajj permits.\n\nThe Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and is obligatory on able-bodied Muslims who have the financial means to perform it.\n\nMany Muslims aspire to fulfil their dream of performing Hajj, where they touch the holy Kaaba, visit the Prophet Muhammad's grave in Medina, and ascend Mount Arafat, retracing the footsteps of the Prophet from over 1,400 years ago.\n\nHowever, with substantial Hajj expenses nowadays, it has increasingly become inaccessible for many people.\n\nMany Muslim scholars have urged Muslims worldwide to abide by the Saudi measures in organizing Hajj to ensure their safety and to avoid hurting others. They also advised people to refrain from unregistered Hajj.\n\nAccording to Saudi authorities, around 1.8 million pilgrims, including 1.6 million from abroad, perform the Hajj annually. Over the past few days, many pilgrims have been reported missing.\n\nThe Egyptian consulate in Jeddah has formed an operations chamber operating round the clock to receive phone calls on (00966565702002) from citizens who lost contact with their relatives in the pilgrimage sites during this Hajj season, said the foreign ministry yesterday.\n\nThe foreign ministry added that it \"is exerting intensive efforts, in coordination with the Saudi authorities, to follow up on the search for Egyptian citizens missing while performing the Hajj rituals.\"\n\nEgypt's tourism Hajj mission reported on Tuesday that it has managed to locate 142 lost Egyptian pilgrims, while one is still missing, according to the Egyptian state's news agency MENA.\n\nAccording to media figures, around 56,000 Egyptian pilgrims are performing Hajj this year.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

Additionally, at least 41 Jordanians, 35 Tunisians and 11 Iranians have died, according to authorities in each country.\n\nA further 22 Jordanians are missing and 26 Iranians have been hospitalized, the Iranian Red Crescent said Wednesday, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nSome of the Iranians died due to heatstroke while others had underlying conditions, the Iranian Red Crescent said.\n\nThe death toll is likely to rise, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt have yet to release official figures. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country's quota - more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims.\n\nThe Saudi government said on Monday that more than 2,700 people had been treated for heatstroke. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for.\n\nMore than 1.8 million people are taking part in this year's Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics.\n\nWhile deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year's gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures.\n\nHajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHajj officials have asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part.\n\nPerforming Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life.\n\nThe pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil.\n\nA source of prestige and revenue\n\nThe Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia's king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam's holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy.\n\nSoon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\nExperts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage's economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.\n\nPilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

It started a day after pilgrims congregated on Saturday at a sacred hill known as Mount Arafat.\n\nThe final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Azha holiday when the faithful with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's (PBUH) test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThe Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) and his son Prophet Ismail (PBUH), Ismail's mother Hajar and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual. \"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\"\n\nNigerian pilgrim Amir Omar was overjoyed once he finished his symbolic stoning. \"I am feeling very great that I perform one pillar of my religion,\" he said. \"I am feeling very grateful.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather were relentless on Tuesday, with temperatures expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, collapsed and required medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens were also reported to have died from sunstroke.\n\nThe fatalities among pilgrims included at least 41 Jordanians and 35 Tunisians, according to Jordanian and Tunisian authorities. Local media in Egypt also reported dozens of fatalities among Egyptian pilgrims. Saudi authorities have yet to provide a death tally during this year's Hajj.\n\nAfter the third symbolic stoning Tuesday, pilgrims headed to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" circling the Kaaba, in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2024 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict.\n\n\"I prayed first for Gaza then Yemen,\" said al-Mehrabi, the Yemeni pilgrim, referring to the war in the Palestinian enclave and the decade-old conflict in his home

May their souls rest in peace,\" the ministry stated.\n\nAt least 550 pilgrims passed away while performing Hajj in Saudi Arabia due to the hot weather, according to AFP's report, as quoted from Sputnik.\n\nSome 323 out of the total casualties were reported to be Egyptian citizens. More than 40 pilgrims from Jordan and 35 from Tunisia have also died due to the scorching heat during this year's Hajj season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indonesian Consulate General in Jidda reported on Monday (June 17) that at least 138 Indonesian pilgrims had passed away while performing Hajj.

It started a day after pilgrims congregated on Saturday at a sacred hill known as Mount Arafat.\n\nThe days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Al Adha feast of sacrifice.\n\n\"This is my second time in Saudi Arabia, and my the first Hajj. Everything is perfect here, I am very happy to be here...police are very helpful and always smiling. It was a nice experience, thank God,\" Lotfy Hajjam, from Toulouse, France, told The National after he performed the stoning rite.\n\nMr Hajjam, originally from Algeria, sent a message of support for the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Palestine is always in our heart, even before the Gaza war. It does not matter where we come from, they are our brothers,\" he said.\n\nZayed Khalil, also from France, said it was his first time in Makkah for the pilgrimage.\n\n\"So far all is well, it's very hot, but thank God everything is well organised. Saudis are very welcoming. Policemen pour water on our heads when we're walking. Everything is great, it feels good,\" he told The National.\n\nHe asserted that \"the Palestinian people are always in our duaa [prayers].\n\n\"Our thoughts are with them. From the first moment of our arrival in Saudi Arabia, we think about them in all the prayers,\" he said.\n\n\"It's true that we're performing Hajj and we're a bit away from all that's happening, but given what happened in the recent weeks it's not possible to forget them.\"\n\nA Nigerian pilgrim told The National he was happy with the \"improvements during Hajj this year, especially in Mina and Muzdalifah\". \"Thank God there are a lot of changes this year.\"\n\nThe rocky areas of Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah are a few kilometres east of Makkah, where pilgrims have been gathering to perform the sacred rite of the Hajj pilgrimage, which culminated with Sunday's Eid Al Adha holiday.\n\nAnother pilgrim, Ashaz, from Pakistan, said he was satisfied with his Hajj trip.\n\n\"It was my first time for the Hajj...it was a good experience...I had the chance to explore many spiritual aspects of my life,\" he told The National.\n\nOn Palestine, he said \"we are like one body...if they are in trouble we feel the same for them, Inshallah Allah will make it easy for them\".\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather were relentless on Tuesday, with temperatures expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Makkah and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Centre for Meteorology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, reportedly collapsed and required medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens were also reported to have died from sunstroke, amid health ministry warnings to pilgrims to avoid peak sun hours between 11am and 4pm.\n\nAfter the third symbolic stoning on Tuesday, pilgrims headed to Makkah to perform Tawaf, circling seven times around the Kaaba. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Makkah for the city of Madinah, about 340 kilometres away, to pray in the Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Makkah and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nThe official number of pilgrims this year was about 1.83 million, Saudi Arabian authorities announced.\n\nAbout 22 per cent of the pilgrims came from Arab countries, according to the official statistics.\n\nThe Saudi General Authority for Statistics put the total number of pilgrims at 1,833,164.\n\nLast year, more than 1.8 million pilgrims performed Hajj, which was lower than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn 2019, more than 2.4 million people made the pilgrimage. Saudi authorities control the flow of pilgrims through quotas, allowing each country one pilgrim for every 1,000 Muslim citizens.\n\nThese included 221,854 domestic pilgrims, including citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia, and 1,611,310 pilgrims from outside the kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It started a day after pilgrims congregated Saturday at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat.\n\nThe final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday when Muslims with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim\u00b4s test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThe Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail\u00b4s mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam\u00b4s holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual. \"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather remained Tuesday, with temperatures, expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMuslim pilgrims use umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun as they arrive to cast stones at pillars in the symbolic stoning of the devil, the last rite of the annual hajj, in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, June 18, 2024. Muslim pilgrims were wrapping up the Hajj pilgrimage in the deadly summer heat on Tuesday with the third day of the symbolic stoning of the devil, and the farewell circling around Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, were seen collapsed and in need of medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens, including 14 from Jordan, were also reported dead.\n\nAfter the symbolic stoning, pilgrims head to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" or circumambulation, circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad\u00b4s tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber tomb is part of the prophet\u00b4s mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2014 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict.\n\n\"I prayed first for Gaza then Yemen,\" said al-Mehrabi, the Yemeni pilgrim, referring to the war between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian enclave and the decade-old conflict in his home country.\n\nMuslim pilgrims rest after casting stones at pillars in the symbolic stoning of the devil, the last rite of the annual hajj, in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for.\n\nMore than 1.8 million people are taking part in this year's Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics.\n\nWhile deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year's gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures.\n\nHajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHajj officials have asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part.\n\nPerforming Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life.\n\nThe pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil.\n\nA source of prestige and revenue\n\nThe Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia's king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam's holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy.\n\nSoon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\nExperts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage's economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.\n\nPilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

The temperature hit 51.9 degrees Celsius in Mecca on June 19.\n\nShocking videos circulating on social media show dozens of dead bodies dumped on the side of the road in areas believed to be around Mecca. Other videos show dozens of bodies wrapped in caffans (Islamic shrouds) being despatched by Mecca authorities.\n\nIraqi, Iranian, Jordanian and Syrian officials have reported dozens of deaths of their compatriots. However, some local media, including Iranian, have tried to downplay the numbers of those who have died in their respective countries' delegations to the holy sites.\n\nAfter the news of the soaring death toll came out, relatives and families started contacting hospitals and making online requests in search of the missing pilgrims.\n\nThe death toll has led to criticism of the way the Saudi authorities are handling the crisis. Arabic language Nabaa TV laid the blame on Saudi authorities for covering up the number of deaths; in its report released on June 20 it said Riyadh authorities \"ignored the deaths\".\n\n\"With successive data on the number of deaths approaching a thousand in non-final statistics issued by countries, the official Saudi authorities did not issue any statement about the disaster and were content through their agencies with claims of the success of the season.\"\n\nDespite the growing number of deaths, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Tourism, Ahmed bin Aqeel Al-Khatib, extended his congratulations to authorities in the country on the \"success\" of the annual Hajj, local media reported on June 20.\n\n\"His Excellency pointed out that this great success achieved was the result of the generous directives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the direct follow-up and supervision of His Highness the Crown Prince - may God protect them - who harnessed all efforts and capabilities to serve the guests of God, to perform their rituals with all ease, ease and reassurance,\" he said in his official statement in the state-owned Al Riyadh newspaper on June 20.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not released information on pilgrim deaths, although it reported more than 2,700 cases of heat exhaustion on June 16 alone.\n\nAccording to AFP, Saudi diplomatic sources say this happens every year and that it is not yet clear whether this year it is unusually high.\n\nEgyptians appear to be the biggest victims this year from the ongoing extreme heatwave, especially near Mount Arafat, southeast of Mecca, which is part of the Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nAn Egyptian diplomat, who requested anonymity, told AFP on June 19 that the number of deaths among Egyptian pilgrims had risen to \"at least 600\" after earlier reports said that at least 323 had died from that country, including babies.\n\nThe diplomat indicated that Egyptian officials in Saudi Arabia had received \"1,400 reports of missing persons so far,\" noting that this number includes the previously mentioned death toll. He added that \"all [new deaths] were caused by the heat\".\n\nPakistani media Vetogate reported at least 144 people missing from that country's contingent since the beginning of the Hajj pilgrimage this year.\n\nAyben Abdel Azim, head of Pakistan's \"lost person's committee\", said they had \"identified the lost people\".\n\nIran's Dr Ali Marashi, the head of the Hajj and Pilgrimage Medical Centre of the Iranian Red Crescent Society, said that so far, \"14 pilgrims to the House of God\" have lost their lives, ISNA reported. He said this consisted of 11 men and three women, with six dying due to heat stroke.\n\nAccording to estimates, more than 2mn people are participating in this year's Hajj ceremonies, which include visits to Mecca, Medina and Mount Arafat, all operated by Saudi Arabia's Hajj authorities.\n\nThe event occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, the date of which moves forward each year. This year's Hajj is at the height of the country's summer heat, exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe number of deaths during the Hajj pilgrimage varies considerably each year due to factors such as crowd size, weather conditions and specific incidents.\n\nHealth-related fatalities and accidents are common at such gatherings. For instance, in 2019, at least 230 pilgrims died from health complications during Hajj, the Times of Israel reported.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews

thought to be more than 200 deaths last year, most of them involving Indonesian pilgrims.\n\nHowever, the actual number is likely to be higher due to the number of unreported cases.\n\nThe

It started a day after pilgrims congregated Saturday at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual. \"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather remained Tuesday, with temperatures, expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, were seen collapsed and in need of medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens, including 14 from Jordan, were also reported dead.\n\nAfter the symbolic stoning, pilgrims head to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" or circumambulation, circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nThe Sacred Chamber tomb is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe 2014 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war,

It started a day after pilgrims congregated on Saturday at a sacred hill known as Mount Arafat.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe final days of the annual Hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday when the faithful with financial means commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's test of faith, when God ordered him to sacrifice his only son, by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and the Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam's holy book. In the Islamic version, God stayed his hand and Ismail was spared.\n\n\"I am reassured. I feel comfortable,\" Mejahed al-Mehrabi, a Yemeni pilgrim, told The Associated Press after he was done with the third day of the stoning ritual. \"Anyone who can visit the Grand Mosque (in Mecca) should do so.\"\n\nNigerian pilgrim Amir Omar was overjoyed once he finished his symbolic stoning. \"I am feeling very great that I perform one pillar of my religion,\" he said. \"I am feeling very grateful.\"\n\nThe burning sun and suffocating hot weather were relentless on Tuesday, with temperatures expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\nMany pilgrims, particularly elderly ones, collapsed and required medical assistance because of the heat. Dozens were also reported to have died from sunstroke.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fatalities among pilgrims included at least 41 Jordanians and 35 Tunisians, according to Jordanian and Tunisian authorities. Local media in Egypt also reported dozens of fatalities among Egyptian pilgrims. Saudi authorities have yet to provide death tally during this year's Hajj.\n\nMany other pilgrims couldn't be accounted for while performing the rituals. Many Egyptians took to social medial to search for their relatives they believed were in Mount Arafat and in Mina. Some were found in hospitals around Mecca, after collapsing from the heat.\n\nAfter the third symbolic stoning Tuesday, pilgrims headed to Mecca to perform \"tawaf,\" the circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. That circumambulation, known as the Farewell Tawaf, marks the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city.\n\nOnce the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal.\n\nMost of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in the Prophet Muhammad's tomb, the Sacred Chamber.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Sacred Chamber is part of the prophet's mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nAll Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once.\n\nMore than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nThe 2024 pilgrimage came against the backdrop of the devastating Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict.\n\n\"I prayed first for Gaza then Yemen,\" said al-Mehrabi, the Yemeni pilgrim, referring to the war in the Palestinian enclave and the decade-old conflict in his home country.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The temperature hit 51.9 degrees Celsius in Mecca on June 19.\n\nShocking videos circulating on social media show dozens of dead bodies dumped on the side of the road in areas believed to be around Mecca. Other videos show dozens of bodies wrapped in caffans (Islamic shrouds) being despatched by Mecca authorities.\n\nIraqi, Iranian, Jordanian and Syrian officials have reported dozens of deaths of their compatriots. However, some local media, including Iranian, have tried to downplay the numbers of those who have died in their respective countries' delegations to the holy sites.\n\nAfter the news of the soaring death toll came out, relatives and families started contacting hospitals and making online requests in search of the missing pilgrims.\n\nThe death toll has led to criticism of the way the Saudi authorities are handling the crisis.

He added that \"all [new deaths] were caused by the heat\".\n\nPakistani media Vetogate reported at least 144 people missing from that country's contingent since the beginning of the Hajj pilgrimage this year.\n\nAyben Abdel Azim, head of Pakistan's \"lost person's committee\", said they had \"identified the lost people\".\n\nIran's Dr Ali Marashi, the head of the Hajj and Pilgrimage Medical Centre of the Iranian Red Crescent Society, said that so far, \"14 pilgrims to the House of God\" have lost their lives, ISNA reported. He said this consisted of 11 men and three women, with six dying due to heat stroke.\n\nAccording to estimates, more than 2mn people are participating in this year's Hajj ceremonies, which include visits to Mecca, Medina and Mount Arafat, all operated by Saudi Arabia's Hajj authorities.\n\nThe event occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, the date of which moves forward each year. This year's Hajj is at the height of the country's summer heat, exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe number of deaths during the Hajj pilgrimage varies considerably each year due to factors such as crowd size, weather conditions and specific incidents.\n\nHealth-related fatalities and accidents are common at such gatherings. For instance, in 2019, at least 230 pilgrims died from health complications during Hajj, the Times of Israel reported.

Additionally, concerns mount over the whereabouts of several Indian pilgrims reported missing, with the true extent of the toll yet to be determined.\n\nThe total fatalities, estimated to be over 550 so far, are primarily attributed to extreme heat and age-related factors and underscore the challenges faced during the annual ritual.\n\nNine of the deceased Indians were from Jammu and Kashmir, with most succumbing to old age or heat-related causes, while two fatalities resulted from road accidents, according to a source.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Centre for Meteorology. Onlookers saw some people faint while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil.\n\nAt the Grand Mosque in Mecca, temperatures reached 51.8 \u00b0C (125 \u00b0F) on Monday, though pilgrims had already left for Mina, authorities said.\n\nMuslims from across the world go for this five-day pilgrimage every year. This year, nearly 1.8 million people went to Hajj. There were close to 1.75 lakh Indians who went on Hajj this year, which commenced on June 13.\n\nIndia has extended all possible support to make the stay of the Hajjis comfortable and even facilitated their transfer from Riyadh to Makkah on a high-speed train.\n\nEvery year, a significant number of elderly pilgrims pass away during the Hajj pilgrimage, with some fulfilling it as a final wish. Moreover, scorching temperatures exceeding 50 degrees Celsius under which these pilgrims walk often result in heat strokes and dehydration, contributing to such unfortunate incidents.\n\nMeanwhile, Egypt bore the highest toll of these fatalities, with over 300 pilgrims reported deceased. Similarly, fatalities among their citizens have been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Kurdistan.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not released any official figures of the death toll, despite reporting over 2,700 cases of heat exhaustion on June 16.\n\nNotably, there were more than 200 pilgrims who died in 2023, mostly from Indonesia. It may be recalled that in 2006, more than 300 people died of stampede and over 2,200 in 2015.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"},

It began on Friday this year and will run until Wednesday. Muslims often travel to Medina as well during the pilgrimage.\n\nTemperatures have been high during this pilgrimage in the past years when it fell on summer months. AccuWeather reported a high of 113 degrees F (45 degrees C) in Mecca on Monday, June 17. But AFP reported that the Saudi weather service recorded a reading of 125 degrees F (52 C) at the city's grand mosque.\n\nThe Saudi Health Ministry said that 2,764 pilgrims on Sunday suffered from heat stress.\n\nWhat can Saudi Arabia do to keep people cool? Start planting trees. Natural shade offered by trees allows the air to circulate, cooling ground temperatures as well. Trees cool our cities by providing shade but also by releasing water vapor from their leaves, which cools the air when it evaporates. Trees can provide up to 10 degrees C less (or 18 F less).\n\nIn the meantime, cooling mists, personal umbrellas, staying hydrated.

According to reports, temperatures have climbed to nearly 52\u00b0C in the city, where about 1.8 million devotees have gathered for the days-long outdoor procession.\n\nAround 175,000 Indians also attended Hajj this year, of whom 68 Indian nationals have been confirmed dead by Saudi Arabian diplomats.

During certain rites such as the Tawaf, eating food is prohibited, but drinking is encouraged due to the risk of dehydration amid such hot environments. Barring the COVID-19 lockdown years, the Hajj pilgrimage typically draws millions of visitors to Mecca, resulting in severe levels of crowding.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has refrained from provided official information on the tragic fatalities, they report that over 2,700 people suffered from \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone. This comes despite large investments in stringent safety measures -- a stark necessity considering that deaths due to heat and other causes have become a common sight during Hajj.\n\nSaudi Arabia, being an arid and hot region, can witness temperatures climbing to especially unbearable levels during its summer months. Further, these temperatures have continued to climb over the past few decades, courtesy of climate change. This can inflict a plethora of heat-related health issues on the devotees that take part in the outdoor pilgrimage during Hajj.\n\nAccording to 2019 MIT research, worsening heat and humidity conditions are set to worsen in several areas where Hajj takes place, posing \"extreme danger\" to the pilgrims. These dangers are inevitable and will continue to mount even if substantial measures are taken to curb the effects of climate change, the study explains.\n\nFurther, as extreme conditions worsen, it lowers the tolerance of the heat-stressed pilgrims in crowds, leading to deadly confrontations and incidents. In 1990, a stampede killed nearly 1,500 people, while another led to the death of nearly a thousand people in 2015. According to MIT study author Elfatih Eltahir, these incidents coincided with peaks in temperature and humidity in the region.\n\n\"If you have crowding in a location,\" notes Eltahir, \"the harsher the weather conditions are, the more likely it is that crowding would lead to incidents.\" Hajj will continue to take place in the hottest summer months of Saudi Arabia from 2047 to 2052, and again from 2079 to 2086.\n\nAdditionally, it is notable that a large number of the Hajj pilgrims constitute the elderly with ageing-related health conditions. For instance, about 40% of the thousands of Indonesians attending Hajj in 2023 were older devotees, according to the WHO. Health risks such as fatigue, dehydration, and infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and MERS-CoV have the capacity to cause more damage to such attendees.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has already invested billions in constructing infrastructure such as air-conditioned tents for pilgrims who are able to avail these services. Further, numerous hospitals and clinics are set up in and around Mecca, with emergency response teams on standby to provide immediate medical attention. The availability of clean drinking water at various points prevents dehydration, and ample sanitation facilities help maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of diseases.\n\nTo manage any agitations, Saudi authorities schedule and stagger the times for different rites to avoid overcrowding. Significant infrastructure improvements, such as the expansion of the Jamarat Bridge and the Masjid al-Haram, have enhanced crowd flow. Clear signage, barriers, and guides help direct the movement of pilgrims, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring smooth transitions between different rites.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in",

This included Tunisian and Jordanian pilgrims who lacked authorized Hajj status, facing extreme heat in Makkah without essential services like accommodation and transportation. This unauthorized participation amplified their vulnerability, exacerbating the toll of fatalities due to the harsh environment.\n\nThe scorching temperatures, reaching 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) in Makkah, posed severe health risks to all pilgrims, especially those without proper permits who undertook long journeys on foot in rugged conditions. Without access to shaded areas and amenities provided to authorized pilgrims, many faced heat-related illnesses and fatalities, highlighting the dangers of participating in Hajj through informal channels.\n\nThe death toll from Hajj 1445 climbed to over 1,081, with reports indicating that a majority were unregistered pilgrims who faced challenges exacerbated by the extreme Saudi summer. Egyptian pilgrims accounted for a significant number of casualties, with concerns raised about the heat triggering complications like high blood pressure among elderly participants. Other countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Jordan, also reported deaths among their pilgrims, underscoring the widespread impact of the heatwave.\n\nRead More: FO Rebukes India's Objections Over Pak-China Joint Statement\n\nThe response from affected nations included frantic searches for missing pilgrims and efforts to assist families in identifying and burying the deceased. Saudi authorities initiated the burial process for those who perished, following traditional practices while managing a high number of fatalities. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts focused on notifying families and providing support amidst the scale of the tragedy.\n\nThe extreme heatwave extended beyond Saudi Arabia, affecting regions like northern India and parts of Europe, where temperatures soared above normal. In Delhi alone, heat-related deaths surged, emphasizing the broader impact of climate change on vulnerable populations. The global context of rising temperatures and heat-related fatalities underscored concerns raised by climate scientists, predicting increased heat stress during future Hajj seasons, potentially exceeding safety thresholds set for pilgrims.\n\nAs the custodian of Islam's holiest sites, Saudi Arabia faces ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of Hajj pilgrims amidst changing climatic conditions. The tragic events of Hajj 1445 serve as a poignant reminder of the risks posed by extreme heat and the urgent need for adaptive strategies to protect pilgrims in the years ahead.\n\nHajj 1445 has been marred by tragedy as unregistered pilgrims faced deadly conditions exacerbated by a severe heatwave. The international response underscores the complexities of managing a pilgrimage of this scale amidst changing climate dynamics.

There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history.\n\nEach year, the hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care,\" according to an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom save their entire lives for the pilgrimage and can be elderly with preexisting health conditions, it said.\n\nHowever, the number of dead this year suggests something caused the fatalities to swell. Already, several countries, including Jordan and Tunisia, have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca.\n\nKhalid Bashir Bazaz, an Indian pilgrim, speaking near the Grand Mosque on Wednesday, said he \"saw a lot of people collapsing to the ground unconscious\" during this year's hajj.\n\nTemperatures on Tuesday reached 117 degrees in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Some people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil.\n\nMany Egyptians said they lost track of their loved ones in the heat and the crowds. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.\n\nOn Wednesday at the medical complex in Mecca, an Egyptian man broke down when he heard his mother was among the dead. He cried for some time before grabbing his cellphone and calling their travel agent.\n\n\"He left her to die,\" he shouted, referring to the agent. The crowd tried to calm him down.\n\nSecurity appeared tight at the complex, with an official reading out names of the dead and the nationalities, which included people from Algeria, Egypt, and India. Those who said they were kin of the dead were allowed inside to identify the deceased.\n\nThe AP could not independently confirm the causes of death for the people whose bodies were held at the complex. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information.\n\nThe kingdom's ruling Al Saud family maintains a major influence in the Muslim world through its oil wealth and management of Islam's holiest sites. Like Saudi monarchs before him, King Salman has taken the title of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray towards five times a day, and the Prophet's Mosque in the nearby city of Medina.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by specialists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. By 2029, the hajj will occur in April, and in the next several years after that it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed more than 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, according to an AP count. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster that same year, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The annual pilgrimage has seen around 10 countries report a total of 1,081 deaths. Earlier this week, temperatures in the holy city of Mecca reached a scorching high of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFatalities have been confirmed by several countries including India, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal and Tunisia.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, it did report more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\n\"People were tired after being chased by security forces before Arafat day. They were exhausted,\" an Arab diplomat told news agency AFP on Thursday.\n\nIn accordance with the customs and agreements with the Saudi Arabian government, the bodies of pilgrims who die during the pilgrimage are not repatriated to their native place, and will be buried in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"So, bodies of both Rukhsana and Ansari have been buried there by the authorities concerned and death certificates will also be handed over to their spouses,\" executive officer of the Karnataka state Haj committee, S Sarfaraz Khan told news agency PTI.\n\nDespite the Saudi officials' advice to use umbrellas, stay hydrated, and avoid sun exposure during the hottest hours, many Hajj rituals require pilgrims to be outdoors for extended periods during the day. Some pilgrims reported seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and overwhelmed ambulance services.\n\nThis year, approximately 1.8 million pilgrims participated in the Hajj, with 1.6 million coming from abroad. However, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the Hajj without securing official visas each year to save money, which is more dangerous as they cannot access the air-conditioned facilities provided by the Saudi authorities along the route.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Migration, and Tunisians Abroad reported that most of the deceased Tunisian pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia using tourism, visit, or Umrah visas. They lacked official Hajj permits and were not associated with any organised group providing essential services such as accommodation, food, or transportation.\n\nSimilarly, Dr Sufyan Qudah, Director of Operations and Consular Affairs at the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, stated that all the Jordanian pilgrims who either died or went missing were not part of the official Jordanian Hajj delegation. They too had entered Saudi Arabia on tourism or visit visas, circumventing the formal Hajj authorisation process.\n\nThis year's Hajj season was marked by an extreme heatwave in Makkah, compounding the hardships faced by unauthorised pilgrims. Without the logistical support provided to official pilgrims, these individuals were left to navigate the demanding conditions on their own.\n\nMany travelled long distances on foot under the scorching sun, traversing rugged and unpaved paths not intended for pedestrian use.

Over 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, navigating their spiritual journey amidst the geopolitical tensions of the Israel-Hamas conflict and Yemen.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumambulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Circumambulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kaaba"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eid al-Adha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_in_Islam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraham in Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/17_06_2024_10_32_28_8678399.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660565", "eventUri": "eng-9660565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

A third stoning is scheduled Tuesday, before the Farewell Tawaf, or circling the cube-shaped Kaaba in Mecca.\n\nThe pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. All Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. The Hajj rites largely commemorate the Quran's accounts of Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ismail and Ismail's mother Hajar -- or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible.\n\nThe rites have taken place under the soaring summer heat, which at 2 p.m. reached 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\n\"Of course, it is something very hard and tiring. The temperature is abnormal compared to the past years and this affects us a lot,\" said Ahmed Al-Baradie, an Egyptian pilgrim, after finishing his second symbolic stoning.\n\nMore than 2,760 pilgrims suffered from sunstroke and heat stress on Sunday alone at the start of the first round of stoning, according to the Health Ministry. Jordan announced Sunday that 14 Jordanian pilgrims had died from heatstroke.\n\nThe number of pilgrims on the roads leading to the pillars Monday morning decreased significantly compared to Sunday.\n\nCarrying an umbrella against the burning sun, Pakistani pilgrim Khoda Bakhch visited the stoning site on Monday morning and planned to return at sunset. \"After two or three hours, it (temperature) may be too much,\" he said.\n\nExperts say heat exhaustion and heatstroke are likely to become more common in the high temperature, with symptoms including heavy sweating, dizziness, muscle spasms and vomiting. Heatstroke is the most serious heat-related illness and happens when the body loses its ability to sweat.\n\nSecurity forces, medics and first responders have been deployed in and around Mina, especially on roads and open areas to direct and help pilgrims.

While the Hajj is currently shifting towards the winter months, climate scientists warn that by the 2040s, it will coincide with the peak of the scorching Saudi Arabian summer.\n\n\"It is going to be very fatal,\" Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist at Climate Analytics based in Pakistan told Reuters. \"Heat-related deaths along the Hajj are not new, and have been recorded back to the 1400s, but the situation will get much worse as the world warms.\"\n\nSaeed and his colleague Carl-Friedrich Schleussner published a study in 2021 that found alarming projections. If global temperatures rise by 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the risk of heat stroke for Hajj pilgrims will increase fivefold.\n\nAlarmingly, the world is on track to reach this level of warming by the 2030s.\n\nThe vulnerability of pilgrims to heat-related illnesses is exacerbated by several factors, including lack of acclimatisation to higher temperatures, intense physical exertion, exposure to the elements, and an ageing population. Last year alone, over 2,000 people suffered from heat stress, according to Saudi officials.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of extreme heat, such as constructing shaded areas, establishing water points, and improving healthcare capacity, these efforts have proven inadequate in the face of the escalating crisis.\n\n\"People are very religiously motivated. For some of them, it is a once-in-a-lifetime affair,\" Saeed said, explaining the determination of pilgrims to undertake the Hajj despite the risks. \"If they get a chance, they go for it.\"\n\nThe staggering death toll during this year's Hajj serves as a sobering glimpse into the future challenges posed by climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the risk to human health and life during the Hajj and other outdoor events will become increasingly severe.\n\nClimate scientists and public health experts are urging immediate and decisive action to address the climate crisis, not only to protect the sanctity of the Hajj but also to safeguard the well-being of millions of people worldwide who are vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat.\n\nAround 1.8 million people from across the world are expected to attend the pilgrimage this year.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lunar calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/hajj-deaths-203952475-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=_Kfb6xQbgosQuF2X3i3_.Hrl37hqAFK3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660565", "eventUri": "eng-9660565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

I witnessed two people succumb to heat stroke right in front of me. The heat was so intense that the air conditioners didn't bring any solace,\" said Farman Zaidi, a 25-year-old pilgrim from New Delhi, who shared his experience with Maktoob.\n\nSeveral others had similar stories. Sibtain Jafri, a 27-year-old resident of Lucknow, who also performed Hajj this year, said that the heat was unbearable.\n\n\"Yesterday, all four members of my family suffered heatstroke, turning it into a life-or-death situation. Since three of us have diabetes, the situation was all the more precarious. The last few days were extremely hot, and walking 20-25 kilometres in such conditions invariably led to illness. Cold water and shade are imperative facilities that need to be worked upon by the government,\" Jafri said.\n\nAccording to data released by Saudi authorities recently, Hajj has increasingly been affected by climate change, with temperatures in the pilgrimage area rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius every ten years.\n\nThe Saudi National Meteorological Center reported that the temperatures around Masjid Al Haram in Mecca touched an alarming 51.8 degrees Celsius on June 17.\n\nAs per an analysis conducted last year by The Washington Post and the nonprofit Carbon Plan, by 2050, Mecca will have an estimated 182 days of dangerous heat for those outdoors in the sun.\n\nIn response to the soaring temperatures, the Saudi government initiated several measures to tackle the heat, ranging from erecting more than 100,000 air-conditioned tents to distributing water and umbrellas, planting trees, and preparing facilities to respond to heat-related illnesses.\n\nHowever, the unprecedented heatwave this year exposed further needs for improvement, particularly in climate control and medical services.\n\nThe official count of pilgrims who attended Hajj this year stood at 1,833,164, of which 1,611,310 were foreigners, according to Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT).\n\nWhile over 1.84 million attended the ritual last year, the official death count was marked at

As for those. who swung into action to serve the guests of God at the Holy Sites, they share moments of joy and self- realization for having an opportunity to render a great altruist service in their lifetime.\n\nThis pilgrimage, with its various stages, is a journey where one's heart longs to visit the House of God, see the Holy Kaaba, and witness the places where Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) spent his youth and early life. It is an experience that engraves an indelible mark on the soul.\n\nTo achieve this noble goal, the Kingdom has implemented several measures. As highlighted by Minister of Hajj and Umrah Dr. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, there are now 35 companies competing to provide services to the pilgrims, which has significantly enhanced quality of services and increased pilgrims' satisfaction.\n\nAdditionally, the establishment of the Hajj Project Management Office, which coordinates between more than 50 governmental entities to serve the pilgrims, has been a milestone.\n\nThe 'Makkah Route Initiative' was also launched and expanded to include seven countries and 11 airports. This year, over 316,000 pilgrims completed their entry procedures at their home country airports and were transported directly to their accommodations in Makkah and Madinah with ease immediately after their arrival in the airports of Jeddah and Madinah.\n\nMaryam Muhammad Munir, an Indonesian pilgrim, shared her memories with the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) at the Makkah Route lounge in Surabaya Airport, Indonesia. She recounted her first pilgrimage 60 years ago with her family on primitive ships that took 5 to 8 months to reach Jeddah Islamic Port, passing through India, the Arabian Sea, and the Red Sea. The journey was fraught with dangers, challenges, and high financial costs.\n\nNowadays, the journey for Hajj and Umrah has been reduced to just a few days. Maryam noted that the Saudi government has spared no effort to make the pilgrimage easier, safer, and more fulfilling, providing pilgrims with a sense of security, satisfaction, and happiness.\n\nJamil Al-Hassan, a Syrian journalist from northwestern Syria, expressed his gratitude to the Kingdom. He shared how the quota allocated by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj enabled him to perform Hajj, a dream his father couldn't fulfill before passing away after battling with cancer. Once Jamil had thought that Hajj would be never possible for him.\n\nAnother pilgrim from Morocco described his indescribable feelings while performing Hajj with his elderly mother and aunt, who shed tears of joy during this journey of a lifetime. He emphasized that nothing compares to performing Hajj with one's mother and hearing her prayers at the Holy Sites.\n\nIn contrast, a Saudi soldier assigned to care for and organize pilgrims said, \"It is enough that they pray for us, even if we don't understand their language.\"\n\nSaudi volunteer Fawziya Al-Bakheet from Hail, along with her friend Latifa Al-Rashidi, came to Makkah to work at the Health Volunteer Center. They both expressed their pride and joy in serving the pilgrims, considering it a celebration for them and their families.\n\nThe exceptional efforts and high-quality services provided by the Kingdom to the pilgrims are continuously improving year after year. This is evidenced by the testimonies of heads of pilgrims' affairs offices, such as Sheikh Sami Al-Masoudi, the Head of the Higher Committee for Hajj and Umrah in Iraq. He stated that \"no country other than the Kingdom can undertake such a massive effort due to its experience and capability in organizing millions of people.\"\n\nNow, having completed their Hajj and hoping for their sins to be washed away like a white garment cleansed of stains, all the hardships and challenges of the journey have faded away, leaving behind an indelible, spiritual mark, the pilgrims observed.", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaaba"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabian Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surabaya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surabaya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Press_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Press Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/New_Age", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/New Age", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2024/06/20/2398827.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660565", "eventUri": "eng-9660565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The airport eased all the entry procedures for the pilgrims -- from the time they got off the plane until they left the airport gates. A total of 25 flights from Jeddah with thousands of pilgrims on board arrived on Wednesday. The first flight by Saudi Airlines arrived at 12:30 pm with about 250 pilgrims on board. A number of officials from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) warmly welcomed the pilgrims and followed up the entry procedures to ensure the smooth flow of movement inside the airport. Pilgrims on board Kuwait Airways flights were received in the passenger terminal (T4), Jazeera Airways flights in terminal (T5), and Saudi Airlines and Flynas flights in the main passenger terminal (T1).\n\nBarriers\n\nDGCA placed barriers throughout the reception area until the point where the pilgrims exited the airport in order to prevent crowding of those receiving pilgrims. The airport's entrances and exits witnessed the heavy presence of security and traffic personnel to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic, reduce congestion in front of the departure and arrival halls, and to organize the parking process designated for loading passengers.\n\nThe arriving pilgrims confirmed that Hajj this year was easy and simple, praising the role of Saudi authorities and their successful management of pilgrims' affairs and facilitating Hajj rituals for them without obstacles. They indicated that the excellent organization by the Saudi authorities contributed to overcoming the difficulties, especially during the stoning ritual.\n\nThey affirmed that the Kuwaiti Hajj delegation was in constant contact with the Hajj caravans to check on the Kuwaiti pilgrims and provide them with all assistance in terms of medical and service aspects. Pilgrim Umm Khaled affirmed her happiness in performing the Hajj rituals, saying: \"My happiness is indescribable. Since entering the Holy Land, we have been feeling joyful despite the fatigue and hot weather, but closeness to Allah alleviated our fatigue.\" She indicated that the Saudi authorities played a major role in facilitating the performance of the rituals, \"as we did not find any crowding during the stoning ritual, except for the farewell circumambulation, but those in charge were worthy of appreciation for facilitating the movement of pilgrims.\"\n\nPilgrim Abdullah Al-Fadaani said: \"Praise be to Allah, we performed the Hajj rituals and returned to the country safely. We ask Almighty Allah to accept our obedience and we praise Him for performing the Hajj. The Hajj rituals this year were more than excellent, and that the Saudi authorities provided all facilities and services so that the rituals could be performed to perfection and at ease.\" Shafi Al-Mazal confirmed that Hajj procedures were eased this year, without any noteworthy observation. He praised the role of the Kuwaiti Hajj delegation, which did not fail to monitor the Kuwaiti pilgrims and provide them with all services.\n\nBy Mohammad Al-Musleh\n\nAl-Seyassah/Arab Times Staff", "source": {"uri": "arabtimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARAB TIMES - KUWAIT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_General_of_Civil_Aviation_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_terminal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport terminal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazeera_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazeera Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flynas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_(travellers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caravan (travellers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdullah of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy Land"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Ritual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Ritual Abuse", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-61.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660565", "eventUri": "eng-9660565", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Egypt has not yet shared an official count, but other countries whose citizens flocked to the holy city of Mecca have been reporting tolls: at least 138 from Indonesia, 41 from Jordan and 35 from Tunisia.\n\nThe Associated Press, reporting from Mecca, also cited a triple-digit death toll, and described people lining up at an emergency health facility to get information about missing loved ones.\n\nWhile it was not clear how many of those deaths were attributable to heat, this year's Hajj coincided with a heat wave unusually searing for June. At one point during the multiday gathering, temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius, or 125 Fahrenheit. More than 1.8 million people took part in the pilgrimage.\n\n{snip}\n\nRead more: https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/19/hajj-deaths-mecca-heat/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farouk_of_Egypt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Farouk of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 11}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660565", "eventUri": "eng-9660565", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 280, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

However, Saudi Arabia gave Indonesia an additional quota of 20,000 pilgrims so that the country could send a total of 241,000 pilgrims this year. This is the largest Hajj quota Indonesia has ever received.\n\nYaqut thanked the Saudi government for its early announcement on the hajj quota as it would enable Indonesia to make the necessary preparations as soon as possible.\n\nThe minister claimed that the 2024 Hajj pilgrimage had been running smoothly. About 213,320 out of the 241,000 Indonesian pilgrims are traveling using the government's services. Only 45 of them could not go to Saudi Arabia for various reasons, and the visa process is now closed.\n\n\"The number of people who fail to depart for Hajj is the smallest in more than 10 years of Hajj management,\" Yaqut said in Mecca on Wednesday, as reported by state news agency Antara.\n\nThe pilgrims also have access to catering services, transportation, and accommodation.

over N8 million per hajj seat.\n\nThe governor indicated that state governors would collaborate to end NAHCON's control over Hajj affairs if the identified issues were not addressed.\n\nHe also

A third stoning is scheduled Tuesday, before the Farewell Tawaf, or circling the cube-shaped Kaaba in Mecca.\n\nThe pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. All Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. The Hajj rites largely commemorate the Quran's accounts of Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ismail, and Ismail's mother Hajar -- or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible.\n\nThe rites have taken place under the soaring summer heat, which at 2 p.m. reached 118 degrees in Mecca and the sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Metrology.\n\n\"Of course, it is something very hard and tiring. The temperature is abnormal compared to the past years and this affects us a lot,\" said Ahmed Al-Baradie, an Egyptian pilgrim, after finishing his second symbolic stoning.\n\nMore than 2,760 pilgrims suffered from sunstroke and heat stress on Sunday alone at the start of the first round of stoning, according to the Health Ministry. Jordan announced Sunday that 14 Jordanian pilgrims had died from heatstroke.\n\nThe number of pilgrims on the roads leading to the pillars Monday morning decreased significantly compared to Sunday.\n\nCarrying an umbrella against the burning sun, Pakistani pilgrim Khoda Bakhch visited the stoning site on Monday morning and planned to return at sunset. \"After two or three hours, it (temperature) may be too much,\" he said.\n\nExperts say heat exhaustion and heatstroke are likely to become more common in the high temperature, with symptoms including heavy sweating, dizziness, muscle spasms, and vomiting. Heatstroke is the most serious heat-related illness and happens when the body loses its ability to sweat.\n\nSecurity forces, medics, and first responders have been deployed in and around Mina, especially on roads and open areas to direct and help pilgrims. They treated many people for sunburns on their feet.\n\n\"I am really impressed by the preparations,\" Sani Abdullah, a Nigerian, said, adding that he was used to such burning heat in his country. \"I have never encountered any problems. Everything is going smoothly.\"\n\nLater in the day, the sky turned cloudy and it rained for a while, helping taper off the stress of the desert heat.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

(51.8\u00b0 C.) on Tuesday, word leaked out that nearly 600 pilgrims had died of heat stroke and 2,000 have been hospitalized for treatment. A virtual clinic treated more thousands remotely. Some 324 of the dead were Egyptians, while dozens were from Jordan. The season of the annual Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of Islam, just ended. Some 1.8 million pilgrims participated.\n\nEyewitnesses said that not all the dead were elderly, that young persons died, as well.\n\nPilgrims carry out a series of rituals during the pilgrimage, beginning with preparing themselves and establishing their pious intention. Many of the steps involve being outside and being active. They dress in white robes. They circumambulate the cube-shaped Kaaba shrine. They run between the nearby hillocks of Safa and Marwa seven times, in commemoration of the search of Abraham's wife Hajar for water for her son with the patriarch, Ishmael. They walk or are taken in buses to Mina and spend some nights of the pilgrimage there. There, they throw stones at satan.\n\nAFP explains that some pilgrims try to avoid paying the hefty visa fees by just showing up unregistered. They however, then lack access to air conditioned facilities and are at special risk of heat stroke.\n\nThe number of heat stroke deaths seems to have doubled since last year. Saudi Arabia is one of the world's major oil producers, and burning petroleum to power vehicles puts the deadly heat-trapping gas, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, heating up the planet.\n\nThe G20 Climate Risk Atlas writes, \"The science shows that Saudi Arabia will experience devastating climate impacts if it follows a high-emissions pathway. Without urgent action, Saudi Arabia will see an 88% increase in the frequency of agricultural drought by 2050. Heatwaves will last more than 4,242% longer and the combination of sea level rise, coastal erosion and fiercer weather will cause chaos for Saudi Arabia's economy, which stands to lose around 12.2% of GDP by 2050.\"\n\nA 12.2% loss of gross domestic product for Saudi Arabia today would amount to a loss of $135 billion annually. That loss alone is more than the entire yearly GDP of Kenya or Ecuador.\n\nFlooding on the kingdom's coasts as the sea level rises threatens 210,000 of the 22 million citizens. Long droughts endanger fisheries, forests and agriculture, which make up 2.6% of the country's gross domestic product. Longer heat waves will reduce the quality of life and menace livelihoods and health.\n\nI have to tell you, I have lived in the Arabian Peninsula. I remember one June evening my wife and I were ready to take a short walk over to a restaurant when it was 114\u00b0 F., and we went out and were met with a blast furnace. We went back in and ordered an air conditioned car for the two-minute drive. We just couldn't bear to walk five minutes in it.\n\nThe Saudi government sees hosting the annual Hajj or pilgrimage as a form of soft power that adds to its legitimacy throughout the Muslim world, comprising some 2 billion persons. If its oil-intensive policies increasingly contribute to disabilities for pilgrims on Hajj, in turn, that development can only harm the monarchy's reputation, since it styled itself \"Servant of the two holy shrines.\"", "source": {"uri": "scheerpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "scheerpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type":

An estimated two million take part in the pilgrimage every year, but increasingly hot days are making the event more dangerous.\n\nAs thermometers reached 125 degrees Fahrenheit this week, the pilgrimage became seriously dangerous for participants. The country's foreign ministry announced 14 people had died on the route as of Monday, according to The Washington Post, with heatstroke confirmed as the cause of six. But as the week progressed, the numbers got much worse, and the latest reporting from the Post and Associated Press is that over 500 people have now died during the pilgrimage, with the AP reporting one estimate of \"at least 600.\"\n\nThere is still a lack of a singular official total, but the Post broke the numbers down across reporting through contacts speaking on behalf of individual countries who had citizens traveling there: \"Two unnamed Arab diplomats told the Agence France-Presse news service that 323 people from Egypt alone had died, most because of heat-related illnesses. Egypt has not yet shared an official count, but other countries whose citizens flocked to the holy city of Mecca have been reporting tolls: at least 138 from Indonesia, 41 from Jordan and 35 from Tunisia.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the fatalities have been expected by some researchers. In a 2019 study, as detailed by the Post, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles warned that there will be serious risks to those taking part in the pilgrimage in the hottest summer months. With the Hajj following the lunar calendar, it's anticipated events from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086 will be seriously dangerous.\n\n\"While this is a truly tragic situation, it unfortunately does not come as a surprise except for perhaps that such events are occurring sooner than expected,\" study author Jeremy Pal told the Post.\n\nExtreme heat increases the risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, heat rash, heat stress, and heat exhaustion. It also makes heart attacks and strokes more likely and can exacerbate pre-existing kidney or lung diseases.\n\nIf the body overheats, it can be deadly. With two million Muslims taking part in the Hajj pilgrimage every year, the death toll of 14 could be eclipsed in forthcoming events if temperatures continue to rise.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's Climate Knowledge Portal, the average seasonal maximum temperature in Saudi Arabia has steadily increased across periods of three decades. Between 1901 to 1930, the average maximum high across June through August was 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Over the next two windows of 30 years, this rose to 104.5 Fahrenheit and 104.7 Fahrenheit, respectively. But between 1991 and 2020, the average high was 106.5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhile heatwaves can be isolated weather events, extreme temperatures are becoming more frequent and longer lasting as a result of human-caused global heating. If high pollution rates persist -- made worse by unsustainable practices in the energy, agricultural, transportation, and manufacturing sectors, to name a few -- thermometers could creep ever higher in the coming years.\n\nAccording to the Post, Saudi Arabia has been trying its best to protect pilgrims. The state has been providing travelers with cold water and has installed large umbrellas and mist fans. It has also established dedicated hospitals to deal with pilgrims exhibiting symptoms of heat-related illnesses.\n\nWith the event moving closer to cooler months over the coming years, it's hoped the impact of severe heat won't be as pronounced. However, the Jordanian tragedies emphasize the need to implement effective pollution-reduction policies worldwide to stop planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane from being released at such an alarming regularity.\n\nThis is largely the responsibility of policy-makers and business leaders, but there are still ways to make your voice heard, and small changes at home can make a difference, too. Even if it's just unplugging energy vampires at night or composting your food waste, reducing energy consumption and landfill waste can limit the harmful pollution we produce on a daily basis.",

This journey began with the first pilgrimage under the reign of the Kingdom's founder, King Abdulaziz, soon after he entered Makkah in December 1924.\n\nWhile Hajj is a great honor for Saudi Arabia, it also comes with immense responsibility.\n\nKing Abdulaziz Calls on Muslims to Join Hajj\n\nKing Abdulaziz has invited Muslims from around the world to join the Hajj pilgrimage. He promised to ensure their comfort, security, and rights.\n\nDue to ongoing unrest in Jeddah at the time, pilgrims were directed to travel to the holy city of Makkah through the ports of Rabigh, Al Lith, and Al Qunfudhah.\n\nIn his message, King Abdulaziz said: \"We warmly welcome pilgrims from all Muslim nations. We are committed to their comfort and safety, and we will facilitate their journey to Makkah from Rabigh, Al Lith, or Al Qunfudhah. Our forces have secured these areas, and we will take all necessary measures to ensure the pilgrims' comfort.\"\n\nKing Abdulaziz Welcomes Charitable Initiatives\n\nKing Abdulaziz announced that all previous barriers to charitable and economic projects have been removed. He invited everyone to undertake such efforts, assuring that the gates of Hijaz are open and the local government is ready to provide full support and facilities for these initiatives.\n\nChallenges of Hajj Before Saudi Rule\n\nOn February 25, 1925, Sultan Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud issued a call to Muslims, inviting them to perform Hajj. This was before he was declared King of Hijaz. How did he organize the first Hajj season, and what conditions did pilgrims face? Security was a major concern, along with disease, mistreatment by local authorities, and lack of services.\n\nBritish documents reveal a lack of clear policies. One document notes the anger of Bengali Muslims due to the poor treatment of their pilgrims in the 1924 Hajj season. Another document states that Indian Muslims found the arrangements in Makkah very poor.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ibrahim Rifaat Pasha, who performed Hajj in 1901 and 1908, documented his experiences.\n\nIn 1901, he noted, \"The ruler of Makkah imposed a tax for the railway, charging each pilgrim one riyal. Pilgrims who refused to pay were detained in Makkah for seven days after Hajj.\"\n\n\"Some Moroccan pilgrims complained to the governor about being detained. The governor sent a representative, but the pilgrims were beaten by the ruler's guards and returned empty-handed. A rightful complaint was met with harsh humiliation,\" added Pasha.\n\nPasha also warned that if this injustice continues, people will avoid Hajj, which would harm the Arab economy and Islam.\n\n\"Hajj connects Muslims worldwide. Without it, Muslims would be easy prey for colonizers,\" he cautioned.\n\nHe described the chaos as pilgrims left Makkah, \"Pilgrims were stopped to pay another tax of one riyal per camel. The congestion was severe, with harsh enforcement by guards. People fell, bones broke, and luggage was lost or damaged.\"\n\n\"The sounds of women wailing, children crying, and men arguing filled the air. There was no police to maintain order. This chaos was due to poor tax collection. The government could have appointed more collectors and scheduled departures by caravan to ensure a calm and safe journey for the pilgrims,\" concluded Pasha.\n\nKing Abdulaziz Acts to Secure Pilgrims\n\nKing Abdulaziz faced various challenges and waited several years before annexing Hijaz. Despite having a clear path forward, he avoided actions that might provoke foreign intervention.\n\nHe pursued a patient approach, issuing statements and communications to clarify his position regarding the Hijaz government's treatment of pilgrims, which justified his eventual annexation decision.\n\nHowever, he delayed due to recognizing the significant difficulties in Hijaz needing comprehensive solutions.\n\nWhile annexing Hijaz was pivotal for his unification efforts, King Abdulaziz's primary aim was to protect the holy sites, ensure safe access, establish peace, and address injustices faced by pilgrims.\n\nHis vision prioritized swiftly providing essential services and enforcing justice based on Islamic principles. Despite resource constraints, wartime conditions, the siege of Jeddah, and international criticism, King Abdulaziz felt deeply responsible for fulfilling this mission.\n\nInaugurating the First Hajj Season under Saudi Rule\n\nKing Abdulaziz successfully oversaw the inaugural Hajj season during his reign, a milestone achieved through divine guidance, clear vision, and meticulous planning aimed at ensuring security, justice, and enhanced services.\n\nThis responsibility was immense, but King Abdulaziz fully grasped its importance, closely monitored its execution, and personally supervised the details. The successful management of the Hajj pilgrimage in the early years of the Saudi state underscored his effective leadership.\n\nSecurity\n\nAfter declaring the restoration of security in the Hijaz shortly after entering Makkah, King Abdulaziz moved quickly to enforce order. He warned of severe punishments for anyone endangering security, especially during the Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nHe deployed patrols to hunt down criminals targeting pilgrims, ensuring their swift justice. Tribal leaders were cautioned against disrupting pilgrim caravans and held responsible for crimes in their territories. This firm stance deterred further criminal activity.\n\nHealth and Municipal Services\n\nUpon arriving in Makkah, King Abdulaziz swiftly appointed his personal physician, Dr. Mahmoud Hamdi Hamouda, to oversee public health.\n\nHe took immediate steps to organize health services and educate the public through articles in the early editions of \"Um Al-Qura\" newspaper. Addressing prevalent diseases and epidemics became a top priority after ensuring security.\n\nKey initiatives included verifying causes of death and issuing weekly statistical reports.\n\nBefore the Hajj season, proactive health measures were implemented to prevent diseases, proposing suitable medical teams with a strong focus on prevention.\n\nSeveral hospitals and health centers were prepared to operate during Hajj. Food and beverage sales, bakery cleanliness, and health guidelines for barbers were monitored closely, with strict penalties for violations.\n\nThe cleansing of holy sites and preparation of sacrificial areas were also part of the comprehensive preparations.\n\nPost-Hajj, a health report confirmed the absence of epidemic diseases and a decrease in mortality rates compared to previous years, accompanied by several recommendations.\n\nWater and Food\n\nKing Abdulaziz prioritized the maintenance of Ayn Zubaydah's water channels, ensuring it remained clear to prevent pilgrim thirst, a lesson learned from past Hajj seasons.\n\nEarly in Dhu al-Qi'dah, the operation of a water pump was announced to transport water to Mina, with efforts to fill reservoirs ensuring water availability for pilgrims. The King entrusted his advisor, Hafiz Wahba, to oversee these operations, inspecting pumping machinery and reservoirs in Mina and Arafat and reporting back.\n\nBefore the Hajj season, efforts to clean and sterilize water channels, reservoirs, and public basins in Mina were completed.\n\nKing Abdulaziz also took proactive measures to secure food supplies from various regions, opening markets and ensuring staples like dates, meat, ghee, honey, wheat, barley, corn, and sesame were available from Najd, Asir, Jazan, and Taif.\n\nHe appointed Abdullah Al-Fadl to procure goods early from Aden and India, resulting in several ships arriving before Hajj carrying flour, sugar, barley, and kerosene. Caravans of camels also delivered provisions.\n\nAnnouncements regarding food availability, price monitoring, and weekly price lists were made, with actions taken against monopolistic traders. Some companies advertised affordable food options, ensuring accessibility for all pilgrims.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"},

Chief Cultural Affairs Minister Muhadjir Effendy addressed the issue of several pilgrims having to sleep outside tents due to overcapacity in Hajj accommodations and inadequate toilet facilities.\n\nHe acknowledged the current lack of solutions, attributing it to severely limited space, including for toilets. The scarcity of land was cited as a primary reason why Indonesian Hajj pilgrims in Mina, Saudi Arabia, did not receive tents.\n\n\"I propose that the toilets should be built on multiple floors, not just one, to save space, because toilets alone can occupy a lot of space, thus they need to be elevated in Mina,\" he told reporters at his office in Jakarta on Wednesday.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, Muhadjir announced that he will personally visit Saudi Arabia on July 3 to evaluate the Hajj pilgrimage arrangements.\n\nHe also mentioned that he had already alerted and instructed the Religious Affairs Ministry regarding the tent issues for Hajj pilgrims.\n\n\"When I visited Saudi Arabia, I wanted to inspect but was not allowed, as the construction process was still ongoing. However, I had already alerted the director of Hajj services to pay attention to this matter, although I couldn't inspect it myself,\" he explained.\n\nMuhadjir identified three critical points where pilgrims encountered difficulties in obtaining tents, namely in Mina, Arafah, and Muzdalifah.\n\nHowever, he noted that the \"mabit\" scheme (overnight stay) in Muzdalifah, allowing pilgrims to pass through without disembarking directly to the tents in Mina, has been helpful.\n\n\"While Mina remains a problem, the duration of stay there is short. There are also issues in Arafah, albeit brief. Currently, in Muzdalifah, the policy is to pass through without needing to stay, which helps alleviate the situation,\" he concluded.\n\nMuhaimin Iskandar, Chairman of the Hajj Oversight Team at the House of Representatives (DPR), raised concerns about multiple issues during the 2024 Hajj operations: malfunctioning air conditioners, overcapacity in tents, lack of adequate mattresses, and improper tent placements not aligned with designated areas (maktab).\n\nHe also criticized the slogan promoting elderly-friendly Hajj facilities, stating that facilities for elderly pilgrims, including toilets and washing facilities, remain inadequate. He noted that while there are bathrooms for people with disabilities, their number is insufficient relative to the ratio of elderly and disabled pilgrims.

It is very common for people to lose their family or the people they came with. So, with this card people or security guards can help find your family using the information on the card.\"\n\nAleid's experience of Hajj was a success, she arrived with a group of pilgrims from the Municipality of Qatif with Masar Batool, a travel service company.\n\n\"I am very grateful to be here. I wanted to come to Makkah for a very long time, I love this place ... I wanted to come to Umrah, but I am here now. Thank God I am in Hajj,\" she said.\n\nFASTFACT\n\nThrough the Nusuk pilgrim card -- an identity card worn around the neck -- Hajj workers are able to verify the identity of each pilgrim, preventing unauthorized people from entering the holy sites.\n\nA video that recently went viral on social media showed the effectiveness of the Nusuk card when a group of Saudi men were able to help a lost Nigerian pilgrim who was found wandering the streets of Makkah. After scanning his Nusuk card, the locals were able to identify the hotel he was staying at and drove him there in safety.\n\nMinister of Hajj and Umrah, Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, reposted the video on his official X account to highlight Saudi \"hospitality, generosity, solidarity, and cooperation.\" The minister continued: \"Thank you to these young people for their help ... here the value of Nusuk appears, which contains detailed data for each pilgrim.\"\n\nThe ministry also, in cooperation with the Saudi National Bank, launched an international digital wallet for Umrah and Hajj pilgrims.\n\nThe Nusuk wallet allows pilgrims to manage their money, while using encryption technology for security.\n\nIn a previous report by the Saudi Press Agency, Ahmed bin Sulaiman Al-Maiman, the director of digital experience at the ministry, said: \"It is the first digital wallet and international bank card in the world, allowing Hajj pilgrims and Umrah performers to manage their money during the period of their stay for performing rituals. Following this move, we have become closer to achieving our goal of developing a successful super-app that meets pilgrim's needs.\"\n\nHe said that the wallet addresses the needs of users and is integrated with the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence, encryption and biometric identity verification, in addition to advanced technologies such as API (application programming interface) and integrated SDK (software development kit).\n\n\"It is also the first open loop digital wallet embedded within an application in the world, designed to enable Hajj pilgrims and Umrah performers to manage their money,\" he added.\n\nSaleh Al-Furaih, CEO of SNB's digital ventures and payments, said the service complies with Saudi Central Bank regulations, which guarantees financial

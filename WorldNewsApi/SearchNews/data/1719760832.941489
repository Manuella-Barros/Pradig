Wilyer Abreu and Rob Refsnyder homered and Brayan Bello won for the fifth time in six starts for Boston, which beat the Orioles for the first time in five meetings this season. Grayson Rodriguez struck out a career-high 10 for Baltimore, which had a season-best five-game winning streak halted. Bernardino entered with a 4-3 lead and two on in relief of Bello (6-2) and promptly walked pinch hitter Ryan Mountcastle, loading the bases. But he struck out pinch-hitter Austin Hayes, induced a weak grounder from Jorge Mateo back to the mound for a force out and then struck out Gunnar Henderson on three pitches to end the threat. Bernardino struck out two more in a 1-2-3 seventh. Boston added three runs in the eighth on pinch-hitter Romy Gonzalez\u2019s sacrifice fly and Refsnyder\u2019s two-run homer. Rodriguez (5-2) gave up four runs in six innings, setting down 13 of the last 14 batters he faced. But he gave up Abreu\u2019s one-out homer and Rafael Devers\u2019 RBI single in the first as the Red Sox took a 2-0 lead. Boston added two more runs in the second when Jarren Duran hit an RBI double with one out and scored on a Devers\u2019 bloop single three batters later. The Orioles scored all three of their runs in the first. Colton Cowser had an RBI infield single, and Jordan Westburg poked a two-run, opposite-field single to right two batters later. Bello allowed three runs and five hits while striking out seven. TRAINER\u2019s ROOM Red Sox: OF Tyler O\u2019Neill traveled to Boston for imaging on his sore right knee.

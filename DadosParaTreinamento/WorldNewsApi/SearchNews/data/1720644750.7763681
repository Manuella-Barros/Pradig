Speaking for the first time about a murder for which his great-great-grandfather was convicted, Olusoga has revealed the lasting impact on his relatives, long after the violent death in 1896 on the streets of Byker. \u201cThe overwhelming sentiment is sadness,\u201d said the historian, best known for his BBC Two documentaries A House Through Time and Union, as he described the feeling of \u201cbad blood\u201d that was passed down the generations; an inherited sense of guilt that prevented his own grandfather ever taking a drink. \u201cIt shaped his life. I never saw him lose his temper. His level of control was striking,\u201d said Olusoga. \u201cThis event in the 1890s, this reverberated through my family,\u201d Olusoga is to explain in a new podcast that will re-examine historical crimes. \u201cIt shaped my grandfather\u2019s life. He was told by his mother that her father had been the murderer and that in this Victorian way that there was this idea of sins of the father, that bad blood could be passed between generations.\u201d The fatal incident at the core of this legacy of guilt took place on the corner of Shields Road and Dalton Street in Byker one afternoon as the victim, a younger man called Daniel Gray, stood talking to friends while on his way back to his work as a painter and decorator. Olusoga\u2019s great-great-grandfather George Ewart crossed the road and drew a revolver. His target, Gray, called for help, crying out: \u201cMurder! I\u2019ve been shot,\u201d according to witnesses, and ran into a shop, begging the owners to lock the door as bullets came in through the window. Gray died of internal bleeding from a wound to his side as he lay on the shop\u2019s floor, in spite of the efforts of two doctors called to the scene. \u201cI have been to stand on that street corner,\u201d said Olusoga this weekend. \u201cIt was a powerful experience. All the key landmarks are still there.\u201d In an account given for the first episode of Was Justice Served?, made in collaboration with the Find My Past genealogy site, Olusoga and the criminologist David Wilson acknowledge the way the public records surrounding a crime are often the only mark left on history by the working classes. \u201cIf you want to understand the lives of ordinary people, then often the only trace left is in the records of criminality,\u201d Wilson said. Olusoga says in the podcast: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ironic that the most vivid of our ancestors, the most vocal of our ancestors, if we are of working-class backgrounds, are those who committed crimes or were the victims of crimes.\u201d The 54-year-old academic has a Nigerian father and is related to Ewart, who was of Scottish descent, through his mother. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in pride or shame in association with ancestors or previous generations of my nations \u2013 but you can look at people from the past and, perhaps especially if you\u2019re related to them, just feel the tragedy of what they went through and the challenges of the times,\u201d he said. The seemingly senseless crime was in fact the result of a fight between the two men 10 years earlier. In 1886, Gray had called on Ewart\u2019s son, Richard, and did not believe that he was away from home in London. In a doorstep tussle outside the Ewart family home, Gray inflicted serious damage to Ewart\u2019s eye. His eyesight was already impaired and the new injury changed his life. Gray was sentenced to two months in prison for assault. After the killing a decade later, Ewart, a painter and cabinet maker who was still living in Byker with his wife and children, went peaceably to the cells, saying of his victim: \u201cYes, he blinded me. I have been waiting a long time but finally got him.\u201d Speaking from Colorado, Jen Baldwin, the genealogist who co-presents the podcast, said she had been moved by Olusoga\u2019s response. \u201cHe already knew something of this crime and understood how it had affected his family,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point of the podcast series is to look for what we can learn about history through looking at a criminal case.\u201d \u201cThis is a story that has shaped the culture within my family,\u201d Olusoga reflects. \u201cIt shaped attitudes that were passed on between generations; ideas about control, very Victorian and Edwardian ideas that actions or predilections could be passed down between generations, and a sense among some generations in my family that they had to control themselves because something terrible had been done by a member of our family with whom we shared kinship. This idea of bad blood.\u201d Ewart pleaded insanity and his daughter, Sylvia, gave evidence that her father had been abusive to her mother and testified to his depressive behaviour. The jury found him guilty, with a strong recommendation for mercy, but he was sentenced to death by hanging. \u201cFor me the most emotive evidence of mental illness comes from George\u2019s daughter, Sylvia, who is a teenager, and she goes to court and she has to testify about the erratic and violent behaviour of her father in public,\u201d said Olusoga. \u201cThey said the witness gave her evidence in a quiet, ladylike and pathetic way, and there seemed to be deep sympathy with her within the court. Now my mother remembered Sylvia. She knew her as an old woman.\u201d A local petition against the planned execution was signed by thousands and delivered to the home secretary, who sent doctors to Newcastle. They judged Ewart to be criminally insane. He was sent to what was then the Broadmoor criminal lunatic asylum. Olusoga said: \u201cI did not know about the petition. It shows there was a strong sense that an injustice had been done.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The historian relates the impact on his relatives of an 1890s crime committed by his great-great-grandfather</p><p>One newspaper headline called it \u201cThe Tragedy at Byker\u201d, a revenge killing that shocked the working-class area of Victorian Newcastle, but for the renowned historian and broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/02/uk-british-empire-david-olusoga-hay-festival\">David Olusoga</a> it is a story that went on to shape one side of his family.</p><p>Speaking for the first time about a murder for which his great-great-grandfather was convicted, Olusoga has revealed the lasting impact on his relatives, long after the violent death in 1896 on the streets of Byker.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/08/david-olusoga-reveals-how-a-shaped-generations-of-his-family\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/08/david-olusoga-reveals-how-a-shaped-generations-of-his-family", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44fcf31095b878a53cec994aaceacbf39697c40c/0_340_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:49", "author": "Vanessa Thorpe", "authors": ["Vanessa Thorpe"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.019}

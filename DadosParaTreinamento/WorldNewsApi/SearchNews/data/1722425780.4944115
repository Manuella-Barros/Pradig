The outreach, which took place on June 19, 2024, fed 21 families in the Agege area of Lagos. The outreach, which was attended by members of the Mavin Records team and the LFBI Team, as well as the beneficiaries of this initiative, consisted of a short-term and long-term approach. According to a statement sent to Saturday Beats, the short-term involved distributing 21 boxes with enough food to sustain a family of five for two to three weeks, while the long-term set them up with adequate resources for poultry farming. Other activities included a refresher course on poultry farming for the beneficiaries, a tour of the LFBI facility and the distribution of the food boxes and poultry resources. Expressing joy at the outcome of the outreach, Arya Starr said, \u201cI am just so grateful for the opportunity to partner with the Lagos Food Bank Initiative and use my platform in such a meaningful and impactful way. I cannot imagine a better way to celebrate my 22nd birthday.\u201d", "summary": "<p>To mark her 22nd birthday, popular singer, Ayra Starr, recently partnered with the Lagos Food Bank initiative \u2014 a non-profit organisation committed to combating hunger and providing a sustainable means of living to vulnerable persons in underserved communities across Nigeria.

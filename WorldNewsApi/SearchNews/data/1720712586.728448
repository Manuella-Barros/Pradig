The coalition includes several smaller regional parties.The swearing-in ceremony took place at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the Indian president in New Delhi. It was attended by thousands of guests, including the heads of neighboring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Two of India's richest industrialists, Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, were present, as was the Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.Tight security was in place in New Delhi with more than 2,500 police officers deployed around the venue and a no-fly zone declared.Analysts predict that dependence on coalition parties will likely curtail some of the authoritarian leanings of Modi's previous governance, forcing the prime minister to engage in consensus politics.Gautam Nair, an assistant professor of public policy at Harvard, said that Modi's nationalist message had stopped resonating with voters.\"This election, even if Prime Minister Modi retains power, shows the power of India's democracy,\" said Rossow.Here are some of the best pictures from India's historic weekend.", "summary": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 73, has been forced to form a coalition government, after a disappointing election for his BJP party.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/narendra-modi-sworn-in-third-term-indias-prime-minister-photos-2024-6", "image": "https://i.insider.com/6665cef5e0790490181742d2?width=1136&format=jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:39:31", "author": "Cameron Manley", "authors": ["Cameron Manley"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.057}

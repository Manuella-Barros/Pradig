The regulatory scrutiny follows concerns about market concentration and aims to ensure competitive practices. Nvidia, OpenAI, and Microsoft face investigation over market dominance and legal compliance.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal that clears the way for potential antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia play in the artificial intelligence industry, according to a source familiar with the matter. The agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not only dominate their industries but are also the world's two biggest companies by market capitalization.\n\nThe move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC bring cases against Meta and Amazon, and the DOJ sue Apple and Google for alleged violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have denied wrongdoing. While OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49% stake.\n\nThe Justice Department will take the lead in investigating whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft. The regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is expected to be completed in the coming days, the person said.\n\nNvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%. Spokespersons for Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment on the regulators' agreement on Thursday. Microsoft said it takes its legal obligations to report transactions seriously and is confident it has complied with them.\n\nThe agreement between the two regulators comes after the FTC in January ordered OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Anthropic to provide information on recent investments and partnerships involving generative AI companies and cloud service providers. In July last year, the FTC opened an investigation into OpenAI on claims it had run afoul of consumer protection laws by putting personal reputations and data at risk.\n\nLast week, Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said at an AI conference at Stanford University that there are \"structures and trends in AI that should give us pause,\" adding that the technology relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already dominant firms a substantial advantage. The DOJ and FTC, led by Chair Lina Khan, share jurisdiction to enforce federal competition law but avoid duplicative investigations.\n\nBill Baer, who led antitrust efforts at the agencies during the Obama and Clinton administrations, said that typically each agency will take the lead in areas where it has amassed expertise. But occasionally the heads of the two agencies will sit down and iron out who does what, said Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. MICROSOFT DEAL\n\nThe FTC is also looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI, over concerns as to whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, the person said. The unusual deal reached in March allowed Microsoft to use Inflection's models and hire most of the startup's staff, including its co-founders.\n\nMicrosoft said in a statement on Monday that the agreement with Inflection helped it accelerate work on Microsoft Copilot, while still allowing Inflection \"to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\" The probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the regulators' agreement on AI by the New York Times.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

The FTC will take a lead role in examining the behavior of OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and struck deals with other AI companies, the sources said.\n\nThe agreement signals increased scrutiny by the Justice Department and the FTC over AI, a rapidly evolving technology that has the potential to disrupt jobs, information and people's lives. Both agencies have been at the forefront of the Biden administration's efforts to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. After a similar deal in 2019, the government investigated Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta and has since taken each of them to court for violating antimonopoly laws.\n\nFor months, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI have largely escaped the Biden administration's regulatory oversight. But that began to change when generative AI, capable of producing text, photos, video and audio in a human-like manner, burst onto the scene in late 2022 and created an industrial frenzy.\n\nRegulators have recently indicated that they want to get ahead of developments in AI. In July, the FTC opened an investigation into whether OpenAI harmed consumers through its data collection. In January, the FTC also launched a broad investigation into strategic partnerships between tech giants and AI startups, including Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and Google and Amazon's investments in Anthropic , another young AI company.\n\nYet the United States lags behind Europe in regulating artificial intelligence. European Union officials agreed last year on historic rules to govern the rapidly evolving technology, focused on the riskiest ways to use it. In Washington last month, a group of senators released legislative recommendations for AI, calling for $32 billion in annual spending to propel U.S. leadership in the technology field, but stopping short of calling for new specific regulations.\n\nDiscussions between the FTC and the Justice Department about AI companies entered their final stages last week and involved top levels of both agencies, said a person familiar with the discussions, who is an official of the FTC.\n\nLina Khan, chair of the FTC, said in a February interview that when it comes to AI, the agency tries to spot potential problems early rather than years and years later when problems are deep-seated and much more. difficult to rectify.\n\nSpokespeople for the FTC and the Justice Department declined to comment. Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Nvidia representative declined to comment.\n\nNvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft have been in the spotlight as being among the biggest winners from the AI boom, raising questions about their dominance.\n\nNvidia, a Silicon Valley chipmaker, is the leading supplier of graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are components suitable for AI tasks such as machine learning. After AI took off, tech companies rushed to get their hands on Nvidia GPUs, doubling and tripling its sales. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 200% over the past year and the company's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time on Wednesday, surpassing Apple.\n\nIndustry players are increasingly concerned about Nvidia's dominance, said two people with knowledge of the concerns, including how the company's software forces customers to use its chips, as well as how Nvidia distributes these chips to customers.\n\nMicrosoft, the world's most valuable public technology company, has also become a leading provider of artificial intelligence. It owns 49% of OpenAI, which burst into the public consciousness with the release of ChatGPT in 2022. The ability of chatbots to answer questions, generate images, and create computer code has captivated people and quickly made the start-up one of the most important companies in the technology sector.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI technology into its own products. The AI now generates answers for users of its search engine, Bing, and can help create presentations and documents in PowerPoint and Word. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement over news content related to AI systems.)\n\nMicrosoft's AI deals have drawn attention for giving one of the biggest tech companies leverage over an emerging technology, while some industry players have raised questions about whether the deals are structured in a way that allows Microsoft to avoid direct scrutiny by regulators.\n\nMicrosoft structured its minority stake in OpenAI in part to avoid antitrust scrutiny, the Times reported. Microsoft also struck a deal in March to hire most of the staff at Inflection AI, another AI startup, and license its technology. Since this is not a standard acquisition, it could be more difficult for regulators to review.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department's antitrust division hosted a conference on AI at Stanford University. In his opening remarks, Jonathan Kanter, the agency's top antitrust official, outlined structures and trends in AI that should give us pause.\n\nAI draws on huge amounts of data and computing power, which can give a substantial advantage to already dominant companies, he said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

Inflection's investors were told they would be repaid over time by the sales proceeds.\n\nCompanies are required to report acquisitions valued at more than $119 million to federal antitrust-enforcement agencies, which have the option to investigate a deal's impact on competition. The FTC or the Justice Department, which share antitrust authority, can sue to block mergers or other investments if an investigation finds the deal would substantially reduce competition or lead to a monopoly.\n\nThe FTC has already been sifting through AI investments made by leading companies such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet. FTC Chair Lina Khan has expressed concern that tech behemoths could eventually acquire or control the most promising AI applications, giving them a tight grip on systems that have humanlike abilities to converse, create art and write computer code.\n\nThe FTC is now drilling down on Microsoft's deal with Inflection, seeking information about how and why they negotiated their partnership, according to a person familiar with the matter and records viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Civil subpoenas the commission sent recently to Microsoft and Inflection seek documents going back about two years. The agency is trying to determine whether Microsoft crafted a deal that would give it control of Inflection but also dodge FTC review of the transaction, the person said.\n\nIf the agency finds that Microsoft should have reported and sought government review of its deal with Inflection, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against Microsoft. Officials could ask a court to fine Microsoft and suspend the transaction while the FTC conducts a full-scale investigation of the deal's impact on competition.\n\nTech companies often buy startups to scoop up their talent, a tactic known as an \"acquihire.\" In Microsoft's case, the company picked off Inflection's specialized workforce of AI researchers but didn't purchase the company outright.\n\nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area, Inflection AI built one of the world's biggest large language models, and launched an AI chatbot with that technology called Pi. Inflection is one of the tech companies that built and sold access to large language models. The others include OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and Google.\n\nMicrosoft was an investor in both OpenAI and Inflection. The FTC in January opened a broad investigation of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and Alphabet's relationship with Anthropic, a rival of OpenAI that was founded by former OpenAI engineers in 2021.\n\nAt Microsoft, Inflection co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and his former team established a new division called Microsoft AI that was tasked with developing AI products for consumers. That includes AI assistants for Bing, its search engine, and Windows.\n\nInflection is continuing operations under a new management team but pivoted away from Pi, a consumer product, and toward services for corporate clients.\n\nTed Shelton, Inflection's new chief operating officer, said he wasn't aware of an FTC investigation. But Inflection wasn't acquired by Microsoft, he said. \"We are a wholly independent company,\" Shelton said. \"Microsoft has no investment in our company.\"\n\nEntrepreneur Reid Hoffman and venture-capital firm Greylock Partners are now the principal investors in Inflection, Shelton added.\n\nThe hires resembled how Microsoft earlier moved to hire Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, after his board of directors pushed him out in November. Altman returned as chief executive of OpenAI after a five-day standoff with the board. The directors had alleged Altman wasn't completely candid in his communications with them.\n\nOpenAI's nonprofit board oversees a for-profit arm that has outside investors. Microsoft invested around $13 billion in OpenAI, acquiring a claim to 49% of any profit it generates.\n\nDeepa Seetharaman contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com and Tom Dotan at tom.dotan@wsj.com\n\nMilestone Alert!

The FTC will play the lead role in examining the conduct of OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and made deals with other AI companies, the people said.\n\nThe agreement signals intensifying scrutiny by the Justice Department and the FTC into AI, a rapidly advancing technology that has the potential to upend jobs, information and people's lives. Both agencies have been at the forefront of the Biden administration's efforts to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. After a similar deal in 2019, the government investigated Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta and has since sued each of them on claims that they violated antimonopoly laws.\n\nFor months, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI largely escaped the brunt of the Biden administration's regulatory scrutiny. But that began to change as generative AI, which can produce humanlike text, photos, videos and audio, burst onto the scene in late 2022 and created an industry frenzy.\n\nRegulators have recently signaled that they want to get ahead of developments in AI In July, the FTC opened an investigation into whether OpenAI had harmed consumers through its collection of data. In January, the FTC also started a broad inquiry into strategic partnerships between tech giants and AI startups, including Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and Google's and Amazon's investments in Anthropic, another young AI company.\n\nStill, the United States lags behind Europe in regulating artificial intelligence. European Union officials agreed last year on landmark rules to govern the fast-evolving technology, focused on the riskiest ways in which it can be used. In Washington last month, a group of senators released legislative recommendations for AI, calling for $32 billion in annual spending to propel American leadership of the technology but holding off on asking for specific new regulations.\n\nThe discussions between the FTC and Justice Department over the AI companies entered their final stages within the last week and involved the senior levels of both agencies, said one person with knowledge of the discussions, who is an FTC official.\n\nLina Khan, the chair of the FTC, said in a February interview that when it came to AI, the agency was trying to spot \"potential problems at the inception rather than years and years and years later, when problems are deeply baked in and much more difficult to rectify.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the FTC and the Justice Department declined to comment. Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft have been in the spotlight as some of the biggest winners of the AI boom, which has raised questions about their dominance.\n\nNvidia, a Silicon Valley chipmaker, is the primary provider of graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are components adapted for AI tasks like machine learning. After AI took off, tech companies raced to get their hands on Nvidia's GPUs, doubling and tripling its sales. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 200% over the past year, and the company's market capitalization exceeded $3 trillion for the first time Wednesday, surpassing Apple.\n\nIndustry players have grown worried about Nvidia's dominance, two people with knowledge of the concerns said, including how the company's software locks customers into using its chips, as well as how Nvidia distributes those chips to customers.\n\nMicrosoft, the world's most valuable public tech company, has also become a leading purveyor of artificial intelligence. It owns 49% of OpenAI, which vaulted into the public consciousness with the 2022 release of ChatGPT. The chatbot's ability to respond to questions, generate images and build computer code captivated people and quickly made the startup one of the most prominent companies in the tech industry.\n\nMicrosoft has woven OpenAI's technology into its own products. AI now generates answers for users of its search engine, Bing, and can help build presentations and documents in PowerPoint and Word. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.)\n\nMicrosoft's AI deals have attracted scrutiny for giving one of the biggest tech companies influence over an emerging technology, while some in the industry have raised questions about whether the deals are structured in a way that allows Microsoft to avoid direct review by regulators.\n\nMicrosoft structured its minority stake in OpenAI in part to avoid antitrust scrutiny, the Times has reported. Microsoft also reached a deal in March to hire most of the staff of Inflection AI, another AI startup, and license its technology. Because the deal was not a standard acquisition, it may be harder for regulators to scrutinize.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department's antitrust division organized a conference about AI at Stanford University. In his opening remarks, Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the agency, pointed to \"structures and trends in AI that should give us pause.\"\n\n\"AI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already dominant firms a substantial advantage,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"},

As part of that deal, Microsoft was said to have paid Inflection $650 million. In its announcement at the time, Microsoft described the move as merely a hiring decision, not as an acquisition.\n\nThe FTC probe into Microsoft concerns whether the company's investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said.\n\nThe investigation comes as antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, two people familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThat agreement, which could be finalized within days, would appoint DOJ as the lead investigator of Nvidia, while the FTC would take responsibility for investigating Microsoft and OpenAI, the people said. DOJ will likely continue its role in overseeing Google, one of the people indicated. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition through abusive and illegal behavior.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the DOJ-FTC agreement but, in a statement, defended its partnership with Inflection.\n\n\"Our agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that the company is \"confident\" it has complied with its reporting obligations.\n\nInflection and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment; Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment. The DOJ and FTC declined to comment. The FTC-DOJ agreement was earlier reported by The New York Times; the FTC's Microsoft probe was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan has warned in op-eds and congressional testimony that, left unchecked, artificial intelligence could \"turbocharge\" fraud and scams. The agency has published numerous reminders and warnings that businesses can be held liable for making misleading claims about their AI tools or for covertly using consumer data to train AI models. The FTC is currently investigating Reddit's AI content licensing practices, and is separately investigating OpenAI for possible violations of consumer protection law.\n\nThe US agencies' division-of-labor agreement opens the door to more intensive probes of a sector that has energized investors, enthralled consumers and raised alarm bells among critics who say AI urgently needs regulation to forestall widespread job displacement, discrimination and fraud. Specifically, it carves out roles for the FTC and DOJ to review whether tech giants and AI companies are behaving in anticompetitive ways.\n\nAnd it highlights how enforcers are increasingly trying to bring existing laws to bear on the industry as prospects for new US laws governing AI have dimmed. The United States is widely viewed as a laggard on AI regulation as others such as the European Union have leapfrogged it with tough rules about how the technology can be used in high-risk contexts. The EU AI Act, for example, outlaws social scoring systems powered by AI and any biometric-based tools used to guess a person's race, political leanings or sexual orientation. It also bans the use of AI to interpret the emotions of people in schools and workplaces, as well as some types of automated profiling intended to predict a person's likelihood of committing future crimes.\n\nFor years, technology critics and regulators have worried that major tech companies may be monopolizing entire sectors of the economy. That has led to high-profile US government antitrust suits targeting Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft.\n\nSome fear that tech companies could abuse their powerful roles in business and society to extend their dominance into the fast-growing field of generative AI, which exploded onto the scene in 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia's soaring stock prices have served as a barometer of the AI frenzy, underscoring the company's position as a leading supplier of computing chips necessary for training advanced AI models. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the second-largest publicly traded company in the United States, ending the day with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion and edging out Apple.\n\n\"AI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage,\" DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said last week in a speech at Stanford University, adding that Americans' reliance on just a handful of technology giants could allow them to \"control these new markets.\"\n\nOne way for tech giants to wield anticompetitive influence in the AI sector, critics say, is through exclusive partnerships with AI startups. The agreements can potentially \"lock in\" AI developers as customers of large cloud computing services and give the tech giants significant stakes or influence over the development of AI. Those types of deals, including Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, are the subject of an ongoing study by the FTC announced in January.\n\nThe DOJ has also become increasingly vocal on AI issues. In 2022, the agency's antitrust division hired Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and AI expert, to be its chief economist.\n\nIn looking at competition in the AI industry, antitrust enforcers should take lessons on how technology giants have behaved anticompetitively in the past, Athey told CNN at a recent event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News.\n\nThat could include gatekeeping or bottlenecking tactics, making it harder for consumers or customers to switch providers, or becoming the biggest buyer of key supplies -- such as AI chips, for example -- and denying those necessary supplies to competing rivals.\n\n\"We should look back to historical analogues and see where sources of market power have been and how people have preserved them, and those are the kinds of tactics we might worry about going forward,\" Athey said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

There are concerns that even though OpenAI is a non-profit, Microsoft invested a lot of money in them. Other countries are also looking into this partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\n$17 billion UK lawsuit against Google's adtech practices can go ahead, tribunal rules US takes on Apple in antitrust lawsuit Google's payments to Apple reached $20 billion in 2022, antitrust court documents show\n\nOpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, but Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49 per cent stake.\n\nNYT, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. eported that the US regulators struck the deal over the past week and it is expected to be completed in the coming days,\n\nAnother probe into Microsoft\n\nMeanwhile, the Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported on Thursday that the FTC is said to be looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI.\n\nThe moves signal growing regulatory scrutiny into the AI industry.\n\nIn January, the FTC ordered OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Anthropic to provide information on recent investments and partnerships involving generative AI companies and cloud service providers.\n\nData privacy\n\nIn July last year, the FTC opened an investigation into OpenAI on claims it had run afoul of consumer protection laws by putting personal reputations and data at risk.\n\nAt an AI conference last week, US antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter referred to \"structures and trends in AI that should give us pause,\" adding that the technology relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, the Justice Department and FTC did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nWhat is antitrust law?\n\nIn the US, antitrust law is a collection of mostly federal laws that regulate the conduct and organisation of businesses in order to promote competition and prevent unjustified monopolies.\n\nAntitrust laws are like rules against unfair play in the business world. They stop companies from doing things that make it hard for others to compete.\n\nThere are two main groups that enforce these laws:\n\nThe FTC has a special team called the Bureau of Competition to look into these issues. The Justice Department also has an Antitrust Division that helps enforce these laws.\n\nThere are also special investigators in some states who keep an eye out for unfair business practices within those states.\n\nWhat was the Microsoft antitrust case?\n\nThe Microsoft antitrust case came to be one of the high-profile cases a few decades ago.\n\nIn the 1990s, US federal regulators sued Microsoft, which was at that time the world's leading software company. The FTC launched an investigation as a response to the rising market share of the company in the personal computer market.\n\nThe investigation aimed to determine whether Microsoft was trying to monopolise the personal computer market. The federal agency soon ended its investigation, only to be brought up again by the US Department of Justice in 1998.\n\nAntitrust litigation\n\nUnder US antit-trust laws, consumers have various protections under both depending upon the specific issue and the state in which they reside or do business.\n\nAccording to the FTC, antitrust laws \"form the foundation of our free economy\" by promoting consumer interests and supporting \"unfettered markets.\"\n\nThrough antitrust laws, consumers have access to more choices in the market for goods and services, and consumers have access to lower prices.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_hilotin@gulfnews.com", "name": "Jay Hilotin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

The FTC will play the lead role in examining the conduct of OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft, which has invested US$13 billion (S$17.1 billion) in OpenAI and made deals with other AI companies, the people said.\n\nThe agreement signals intensifying scrutiny by the Justice Department and the FTC into AI, a rapidly advancing technology that has the potential to upend jobs, information and people's lives. Both agencies have been at the forefront of the Biden administration's efforts to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. After a similar deal in 2019, the government investigated Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta and has since sued each of them on claims that they violated antimonopoly laws.\n\nFor months, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI largely escaped the brunt of the Biden administration's regulatory scrutiny. But that began to change as generative AI, which can produce humanlike text, photos, videos and audio, burst onto the scene in late 2022 and created an industry frenzy.\n\nRegulators have recently signalled that they want to get ahead of developments in AI In July, the FTC opened an investigation into whether OpenAI had harmed consumers through its collection of data. In January, the FTC also started a broad inquiry into strategic partnerships between tech giants and AI startups, including Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and Google's and Amazon's investments in Anthropic, another young AI company.\n\nStill, the United States lags behind Europe in regulating artificial intelligence. European Union officials agreed in 2023 on landmark rules to govern the fast-evolving technology, focused on the riskiest ways in which it can be used. In Washington last month, a group of senators released legislative recommendations for AI, calling for US$32 billion in annual spending to propel American leadership of the technology but holding off on asking for specific new regulations.\n\nThe discussions between the FTC and Justice Department over the AI companies entered their final stages within the last week and involved the senior levels of both agencies, said one person with knowledge of the discussions, who is an FTC official.\n\nMs Lina Khan, the chair of the FTC, said in a February interview that when it came to AI, the agency was trying to spot \"potential problems at the inception rather than years and years and years later, when problems are deeply baked in and much more difficult to rectify.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the FTC and the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nNvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft have been in the spotlight as some of the biggest winners of the AI boom, which has raised questions about their dominance.\n\nNvidia, a Silicon Valley chipmaker, is the primary provider of graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are components adapted for AI tasks like machine learning. After AI took off, tech companies raced to get their hands on Nvidia's GPUs, doubling and tripling its sales. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 200 per cent over the past year, and the company's market capitalization exceeded US$3 trillion for the first time Wednesday, surpassing Apple.\n\nIndustry players have grown worried about Nvidia's dominance, two people with knowledge of the concerns said, including how the company's software locks customers into using its chips, as well as how Nvidia distributes those chips to customers.\n\nMicrosoft, the world's most valuable public tech company, has also become a leading purveyor of artificial intelligence. It owns 49 per cent of OpenAI, which vaulted into the public consciousness with the 2022 release of ChatGPT. The chatbot's ability to respond to questions, generate images and build computer code captivated people and quickly made the startup one of the most prominent companies in the tech industry.",

The United States is widely viewed as a laggard on AI regulation as others such as the European Union have leapfrogged it with tough rules about how the technology can be used in high-risk contexts.\n\nNvidia's soaring stock prices have served as a barometer of the AI frenzy, underscoring the company's position as a leading supplier of computing chips necessary for training advanced AI models. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the second-largest publicly traded company in the United States, ending the day with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion and edging out Apple.\n\nFor years, technology critics and regulators have worried that major tech companies may be monopolizing entire sectors of the economy. That has led to high-profile US government antitrust suits targeting Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft.\n\nSome fear that tech companies could abuse their powerful roles in business and society to extend their dominance into the fast-growing field of generative AI, which exploded onto the scene in 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT.\n\n\"AI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage,\" DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said last week in a speech at Stanford University. \"Powerful network effects may enable dominant firms to control these new markets.\"\n\nOne way for tech giants to wield anticompetitive influence in the AI sector, critics say, is through exclusive partnerships with AI startups. The agreements can potentially \"lock in\" AI developers as customers of large cloud computing services and give the tech giants significant stakes or influence over the development of AI. Those types of deals, including Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, are the subject of an ongoing study by the FTC announced in January.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan has warned in op-eds and congressional testimony that, left unchecked, artificial intelligence could \"turbocharge\" fraud and scams. The agency has published numerous reminders and warnings that businesses can be held liable for making misleading claims about their AI tools or for covertly using consumer data to train AI models. The FTC is currently investigating Reddit's AI content licensing practices, and is separately investigating OpenAI for possible violations of consumer protection law.\n\nThe DOJ has also become increasingly vocal on AI issues. In 2022, the agency's antitrust division hired Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and AI expert, to be its chief economist.\n\nIn looking at competition in the AI industry, antitrust enforcers should take lessons on how technology giants have behaved anticompetitively in the past, Athey told CNN at a recent event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News.\n\nThat could include gatekeeping or bottlenecking tactics, making it harder for consumers or customers to switch providers, or becoming the biggest buyer of key supplies -- such as AI chips, for example -- and denying those necessary supplies to competing rivals.\n\n\"We should look back to historical analogues and see where sources of market power have been and how people have preserved them, and those are the kinds of tactics we might worry about going forward,\" Athey said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at

Reports on Wednesday indicated that regulators have agreed to proceed with antitrust investigations into the dominant positions of Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the matter revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reached a preliminary agreement last week, with expectations to finalize it in the coming days.\n\nThe DOJ will lead the investigation into Nvidia, the world's largest chip manufacturer, for potential antitrust violations. Meanwhile, the FTC will oversee antitrust inquiries into OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThis move signals the most robust indication yet that U.S. regulators are intensifying their scrutiny of antitrust issues within the rapidly evolving AI sector.\n\nRegulators recently expressed their intention to proactively regulate AI development. Last July, the FTC began investigating whether OpenAI's data collection practices might harm consumers.\n\nIn January, the FTC expanded its oversight to scrutinize strategic partnerships between tech giants and AI startups, including Microsoft's significant investment in OpenAI and collaborations between Google, Amazon, and Anthropic.\n\nInterestingly, Microsoft's partnership with AI unicorn Inflection has also drawn FTC attention. In this arrangement, Microsoft did not acquire Inflection outright but instead poached nearly all of its employees, from founders to engineers. Microsoft also agreed to pay around $650 million for licensing Inflection's technology.\n\nOn Thursday, reports emerged that the FTC launched an investigation to determine whether Microsoft circumvented government antitrust reviews while gaining control of Inflection. The FTC has requested documents from both parties covering approximately two years.\n\nUnder antitrust regulations, any acquisition valued at over $119 million must be reported to federal antitrust enforcement agencies, which can then choose to investigate the transaction's impact on market competition. If such an investigation finds that the deal could lead to monopolistic practices, the FTC or DOJ can sue to block the acquisition.\n\nIf the FTC determines that Microsoft intentionally avoided antitrust scrutiny, it could sue the tech giant, seeking fines and demanding that Microsoft halt the transaction pending a thorough FTC investigation.", "source": {"uri": "btimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://datacdn.btimesonline.com/data/images/full/122466/microsoft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

DOJ will likely continue its role in overseeing Google, one of the people indicated. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition through abusive and illegal behavior.\n\nThe FTC probe into Microsoft, meanwhile, concerns whether the company's investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said.\n\nIn March, Microsoft announced it had hired Inflection's co-founders and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model would be hosted on Microsoft's cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was said to have paid $650 million to Inflection.\n\nMicrosoft, Inflection and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment; Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment. The DOJ and FTC declined to comment. The FTC-DOJ agreement was earlier reported by The New York Times; the FTC's Microsoft probe was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe US agencies' division-of-labor agreement opens the door to more intensive probes of a sector that has energized investors, enthralled consumers and raised alarm bells among critics who say AI urgently needs regulation to forestall widespread job displacement, discrimination and fraud.\n\nAnd it highlights how enforcers are increasingly trying to bring existing laws to bear on the industry as prospects for new US laws governing AI have dimmed. The United States is widely viewed as a laggard on AI regulation as others such as the European Union have leapfrogged it with tough rules about how the technology can be used in high-risk contexts.\n\nNvidia's soaring stock prices have served as a barometer of the AI frenzy, underscoring the company's position as a leading supplier of computing chips necessary for training advanced AI models. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the second-largest publicly traded company in the United States, ending the day with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion and edging out Apple.\n\nFor years, technology critics and regulators have worried that major tech companies may be monopolizing entire sectors of the economy. That has led to high-profile US government antitrust suits targeting Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft.\n\nSome fear that tech companies could abuse their powerful roles in business and society to extend their dominance into the fast-growing field of generative AI, which exploded onto the scene in 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT.\n\n\"AI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage,\" DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said last week in a speech at Stanford University. \"Powerful network effects may enable dominant firms to control these new markets.\"\n\nOne way for tech giants to wield anticompetitive influence in the AI sector, critics say, is through exclusive partnerships with AI startups. The agreements can potentially \"lock in\" AI developers as customers of large cloud computing services and give the tech giants significant stakes or influence over the development of AI. Those types of deals, including Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, are the subject of an ongoing study by the FTC announced in January.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan has warned in op-eds and congressional testimony that, left unchecked, artificial intelligence could \"turbocharge\" fraud and scams. The agency has published numerous reminders and warnings that businesses can be held liable for making misleading claims about their AI tools or for covertly using consumer data to train AI models. The FTC is currently investigating Reddit's AI content licensing practices, and is separately investigating OpenAI for possible violations of consumer protection law.\n\nThe DOJ has also become increasingly vocal on AI issues. In 2022, the agency's antitrust division hired Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and AI expert, to be its chief economist.\n\nIn looking at competition in the AI industry, antitrust enforcers should take lessons on how technology giants have behaved anticompetitively in the past, Athey told CNN at a recent event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News.\n\nThat could include gatekeeping or bottlenecking tactics, making it harder for consumers or customers to switch providers, or becoming the biggest buyer of key supplies -- such as AI chips, for example -- and denying those necessary supplies to competing rivals.\n\n\"We should look back to historical analogues and see where sources of market power have been and how people have preserved them, and those are the kinds of tactics we might worry about going forward,\" Athey said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The agreement, expected to be finalized in the coming days, marks the strongest sign yet of the escalating regulatory scrutiny into the powerful technology.\n\nUnder the arrangement, the Justice Department will take the lead in investigating Nvidia, the world's largest maker of AI chips, to determine whether its behavior has violated antitrust laws. Meanwhile, the FTC will spearhead the examination of OpenAI, the creator of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and secured deals with other AI companies.\n\nThe intensifying scrutiny by the Justice Department and the FTC into AI comes as the technology rapidly advances, with the potential to disrupt jobs, information, and people's lives. Both agencies have been at the forefront of the effort to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies, having previously investigated and sued Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta for alleged violations of antimonopoly laws.\n\nWhile Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI had largely escaped the brunt of regulatory scrutiny for months, this began to change as generative AI burst onto the scene in late 2022, creating an industry frenzy.

This essentially gave them a monopoly, stifling competition and harming consumers.\n\n* Antitrust: Laws were passed to fight against these trusts and similar practices that limit competition. These became known as \"antitrust laws.\"\n\n* Lawsuit: A lawsuit is a legal case brought against someone who is accused of wrongdoing.\n\n* The Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act are the three main laws in the history of US antitrust regulation. What is an antitrust law?\n\nIn the US, antitrust law is a collection of mostly federal laws that regulate the conduct and organisation of businesses in order to promote competition and prevent unjustified monopolies.\n\nAntitrust laws are like rules against unfair play in the business world. They stop companies from doing things that make it hard for others to compete.\n\nGoogle's payments to Apple reached $20 billion in 2022, antitrust court documents show US takes on Apple in antitrust lawsuit\n\nThere are two main organisations that enforce these laws:\n\nThe FTC has a special team called the Bureau of Competition to look into these issues. The Justice Department also has an Antitrust Division that helps enforce these laws.\n\nThere are also special investigators in some states who keep an eye out for unfair business practices within those states.\n\nWhat was the Microsoft antitrust case?\n\nThe Microsoft antitrust case came to be one of the high-profile cases a few decades ago.\n\nIn the 1990s, US federal regulators sued Microsoft, which was at that time the world's leading software company. The FTC launched an investigation as a response to the rising market share of the company in the personal computer market.\n\nThe investigation aimed to determine whether Microsoft was trying to monopolise the personal computer market. The federal agency soon ended its investigation, only to be brought up again by the US Department of Justice in 1998.\n\nAntitrust litigation\n\nUnder US antit-trust laws, consumers have various protections under both depending upon the specific issue and the state in which they reside or do business.\n\nAccording to the FTC, antitrust laws \"form the foundation of our free economy\" by promoting consumer interests and supporting \"unfettered markets.\"\n\nThrough antitrust laws, consumers have access to more choices in the market for goods and services, and consumers have access to lower prices.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_hilotin@gulfnews.com", "name": "Jay Hilotin", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition.\n\nThe FTC probe into Microsoft, meanwhile, concerns whether the company's investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said.\n\nIn March, Microsoft announced it had hired Inflection's co-founders and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model would be hosted on Microsoft's cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was said to have paid $650 million to Inflection.\n\nMicrosoft, Inflection, Google, and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nThe US agencies' division-of-labor agreement opens the door to more intensive probes of a sector that has energized investors, enthralled consumers and raised alarm bells among critics who say AI urgently needs regulation to forestall widespread job displacement, discrimination and fraud.\n\nAnd it highlights how enforcers are increasingly trying to bring existing laws to bear on the industry as prospects for new US laws governing AI have dimmed.

At the same time, the FTC will focus on OpenAI and Microsoft. The report added that Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and made deals with other AI companies.\n\nAlso Read | Microsoft layoffs: Tech giant announces job cuts; 1,000 employees to be laid off\n\nThe agreement signals increased scrutiny from both the Justice Department and the FTC into AI, a technology advancing rapidly and potentially impacting jobs, information, and people's lives significantly. Both agencies have been proactive in the Biden administration's efforts to control the power of major tech companies. In a similar deal in 2019, the government investigated Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta, subsequently suing each for alleged antitrust violations, the New York Times report added.\n\nAlso Read | Oppo collaborates with Google, Microsoft, and MediaTek for AI innovation; files over 5,000 patents globally\n\nFor months, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI largely avoided the Biden administration's regulatory focus.

In July, the FTC investigated whether OpenAI harmed consumers through data collection.

In Washington last month, a group of senators released legislative recommendations for AI, advocating for $32 billion in annual spending to bolster American leadership in the technology but refraining from calling for specific new regulations, the New York Times reported.\n\nAlso Read | Microsoft President Brad Smith warns of 'Deepfake' threat in European elections, urges caution\n\nThe final discussions between the FTC and the Justice Department over AI companies occurred within the last week and involved senior officials from both agencies. The report further added that one source, an FTC official, noted the significance of these discussions.\n\nIn a February interview, Lina Khan, the FTC chair, emphasized that regarding AI, the agency aims to identify \"potential problems at the inception rather than years and years and years later when problems are deeply baked in and much more difficult to rectify.\"\n\nMilestone Alert!

The Federal Trade Commission is now seeking information about how they negotiated that partnership, the Journal reported. The unusual deal resembled an \"acqui-hire\" - where big companies take over startups mostly for their employees - but without an acquisition. Legal and industry experts at the time suggested Microsoft's Inflection deal may trigger regulatory concerns.\n\nThe news coincides with heightened scrutiny over the players in artificial intelligence, a technology with the potential to transform economies and industries. The Justice Department has said it will step up its focus on competition in the AI sector, as Big Tech ploughs billions of dollars into developing ChatGPT-like services.\n\nRepresentatives for Microsoft, Inflection and the FTC weren't immediately available for comment after normal hours.\n\nThe Biden administration's antitrust agencies are already pursuing cases against some of the world's largest technology companies, including Alphabet's Google, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms.

WCGW?\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia are set to be investigated for potential antitrust violations with regard to their dominant positions in the burgeoning AI industry, according to reports.\n\nAn agreement is said to have been reached whereby the US Department of Justice (DoJ) will take the lead on looking into the behavior of GPU giant Nvidia, while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is to carry out a similar probe into generative AI developer OpenAI and its relationship with Microsoft, or so says The New York Times.\n\nThe FTC declined to comment, and the DoJ had not responded to our request at the time of publication.\n\nAll three companies have been riding the wave of interest and investment in AI over the past several years, especially since OpenAI unleashed ChatGPT onto the world towards the end of 2022.\n\nMicrosoft, which is a key investor in OpenAI, is currently the world's most valuable company, with an estimated worth of $3.15 trillion, while Nvidia is now in second place with a valuation of $3.012 trillion, driven by huge demand for its AI accelerator hardware.\n\nThe issue with Microsoft is that it has sunk a huge amount of money into OpenAI - said to total as much as $13 billion - as well as making deals with other AI companies. The investigation will consider if this relationship gives the pair an unfair advantage, particularly around the technology for large language models such as ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia dominates the GPU market with an estimated 80 percent share, according to some figures, although it is starting to face more competition from rivals such as Intel and AMD. That alone leaves the company open to claims it is a monopoly, especially as many of its software tools work only with its own GPUs.\n\nAccording to news site Politico, the agreement between the DoJ and FTC over the investigations has been negotiated for nearly a year, as the two agencies share antitrust enforcement in the US but must clear any investigation with their counterpart first.\n\nBoth agencies said it was vital to ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence market was not dominated by the existing tech giants, but an agreement was needed before work could begin.\n\nThe FTC has also opened another investigation into whether a $650 million deal between Microsoft and another AI outfit, Inflection AI, may have been structured to avoid scrutiny from regulators while effectively being an acquisition.\n\nAs reported by The Register in April, Microsoft created an AI division headed by Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, founders of InflectionAI, then much of the company's workforce transferred to the Redmond giant and it also got the right to use Inflection's models as part of the deal.\n\nThe move is said to have also attracted the attention of regulators in the European Union, who are already looking into Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and another AI operation called Mistral.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the moves indicate that regulators are increasingly concerned about the AI industry and are beginning to put it under closer scrutiny. With this and legal action regarding the unauthorized use of copyrighted content in order to train AI models, it looks like the AI industry could be in for a bumpy ride. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/06/06/shutterstock_ai.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The size of its investment has since swelled to about $13 billion. Microsoft heavily uses OpenAI's model for its Copilot chatbot and offers open source models on its Azure cloud.\n\nThe hefty investments are necessary because AI models are notoriously expensive to build and train, requiring thousands of specialized chips that, to date, have largely come from Nvidia. Meta, which is developing its own model called Llama, has said it's spending billions on Nvidia's graphics processing units, one of the many companies that's helped the chipmaker bolster year-over-year revenue by more than 250%.\n\nNews of the coming antitrust investigation comes days after a group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter Tuesday, describing concerns about the AI industry's rapid advancement despite a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.\n\n\"AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" the employees wrote, adding that the companies \"currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society.

Microsoft heavily uses OpenAI's model for its Copilot chatbot and offers open source models on its Azure cloud.\n\nThe hefty investments are necessary because AI models are notoriously expensive to build and train, requiring thousands of specialized chips that, to date, have largely come from Nvidia. Meta, which is developing its own model called Llama, has said it's spending billions on Nvidia's graphics processing units, one of the many companies that's helped the chipmaker bolster year-over-year revenue by more than 250%.\n\nNews of the coming antitrust investigation comes days after a group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter Tuesday, describing concerns about the AI industry's rapid advancement despite a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.\n\n\"AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" the employees wrote, adding that the companies \"currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\"\n\nThe news also follows the FTC's January decision to conduct an extensive study on AI industry heavyweights, including Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Anthropic and OpenAI.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry in January during the agency's tech summit on AI, describing it as a \"market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.\"\n\nBy invoking its authority to conduct a so-called 6(b) study -- named for Section 6(b) of the FTC Act -- the regulator can look into the AI companies separately from its law enforcement arm and make civil investigative demands. For example, the agency can order companies to file specific reports and answer questions in writing about their businesses.\n\n\"At the FTC, the rapid development and deployment of AI is informing our work across the agency,\" Khan said at the time. \"There's no AI exemption from the laws on the books, and we're looking closely at the ways companies may be using their power to thwart competition or trick the public.\"\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors":

Back in March, the company hired almost all of Inflection AI's employees, including founders Kar\u00e9n Simonyan and Mustafa Suleyman, who was also a DeepMind cofounder. In addition, Microsoft paid Inflection AI $650 million to license its artificial intelligence technology. Now, the FTC wants to know whether the companies deliberately structured the deal to avoid being the subject of regulatory antitrust review.\n\nAs The Journal notes, companies are required to report any acquisition that's valued at $119 million or more to federal antitrust agencies. The FTC or the Justice Department could then investigate whether the deal stifles competition in the industry and then sue to block the merger or the investment that it deems to be anti-competitive. When companies want to hire all the talent in another firm, they typically buy the other out in an \"acquihire.\" But Microsoft didn't buy Inflection, which denied that the bigger company has any power over it. Ted Shelton, its new COO, told the publication that it still operates as an independent company under new leadership.\n\nThe FTC has already sent out subpoenas to both Microsoft and Inflection, asking for relevant documents over the past two years. If it does determine that the companies entered into an agreement in a way that would give Microsoft control over the other while dodging regulatory review, then Microsoft could be fined, and the transaction could be suspended pending a more in-depth investigation.\n\nUS federal agencies have been cracking down on monopolistic practices by the world's largest tech companies over the past few years. To be even more efficient in conducting antitrust investigations involving the current biggest players in artificial intelligence, the agencies have also just struck a deal on how they're dividing their responsibilities.

The FTC will take the lead in investigating OpenAI and its partner Microsoft.\n\nThe report notes that the three companies had until now avoided heavy oversight by the Biden administration, though the winds began to change as generative AI became more ubiquitous.\n\nIn January, the FTC launched an investigation into the partnerships between tech giants Google and Microsoft and their respective partnerships with AI startups Anthropic and OpenAI. According to the Wall Street Journal, the FTC has already sent subpoenas to Microsoft to examine the partnership with OpenAI.\n\nThat inquiry, the commission said at the time, would make sure that companies that are developing and monetizing AI are not employing methods that prevent the creation of new markets and restrict healthy competition.\n\nDuring a speech in April, FTC Chair Lina Khan said technology companies have tried to \"dazzle\" policymakers with AI's potential, but to no avail.\n\n\"There's no exemption from the laws prohibiting collusion, laws prohibiting price fixing, laws prohibiting monopolization, laws prohibiting fraud,\" Khan said at an antitrust conference in Washington. \"The FTC is going to take action.\"\n\nBut, as the NYT report points out, the U.S. still lags Europe in AI regulations, with the European Union last year forming a landmark agreement on rules to curb the risks the fast-growing technology presents.\n\nIn the U.S., AI regulation is happening at the state level. For example, lawmakers in Illinois have passed a flurry of measures aimed at addressing AI concerns, including one that would expand child exploitation laws to cover AI-generated content. Another would protect people from having their voice, image or likeness duplicated by AI for commercial purposes without their permission.\n\nAnd as has been covered here, California has voted to regulate AI and businesses' personal data use.\n\n\"In this federal legislative vacuum, states are taking the lead, with California emerging as a key player,\" PYMNTS wrote earlier this week.\n\nThe state is home to 32 of Forbes' top 50 global AI companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta and Google.\n\n\"The presence of such major AI developers makes California an attractive jurisdiction for advancing responsible AI policy,\" the Brookings Institution said in a repent report.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the Wall Street Journal, this inquiry brings attention to the heightened regulatory scrutiny in the growing artificial intelligence field.\n\nIn March, Microsoft engaged in a major deal with Inflection AI, including the hiring of its co-founder and the majority of its workforce. As part of the agreement, Microsoft committed approximately $650 million to Inflection, categorized as a licensing fee for the startup's technology. Investors were assured of repayment through future sales.\n\nCurrent regulations mandate that acquisitions over $119 million be reported to federal antitrust authorities, who then evaluate the deal's impact on market competition. The FTC or the Justice Department can intervene if a merger is deemed to significantly reduce competition or create a monopoly.\n\nThe FTC's investigation is part of its wider scrutiny of AI investments by major tech companies, including Microsoft and Google parent company, Alphabet. FTC Chair Lina Khan has expressed concerns that leading tech firms could dominate the most promising AI technologies, potentially hindering competition and innovation in the sector.\n\nThe FTC is assessing the specifics of Microsoft's deal with Inflection AI, focusing on the motivations and terms of the partnership. Civil subpoenas have been issued to both companies, requesting documents from the past two years to determine if Microsoft's arrangement was meant to bypass FTC oversight while still securing control over Inflection's assets.\n\nIf the FTC finds that Microsoft should have reported the deal, enforcement actions could follow. These may include fines and halting the transaction while a thorough investigation is conducted to understand its competitive impacts.\n\nMicrosoft's strategy to integrate Inflection's talent without purchasing the company outright reflects a common industry practice known as an \"acquihire.\" This technique allows companies to bring in specialized workforces without the complexities of a full acquisition.\n\nInflection AI, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, is recognized for developing one of the largest language models and launching an AI chatbot named Pi. Despite the deal with Microsoft, Inflection continues to operate independently under new management, shifting its focus from consumer products to corporate services.\n\nTed Shelton, Inflection's new chief operating officer, said he was unaware of the FTC investigation. He highlighted that Inflection remains a wholly independent entity with no direct investment from Microsoft. The primary backers are entrepreneur Reid Hoffman and venture-capital firm Greylock Partners.\n\nThis hiring strategy is similar to Microsoft's earlier move to bring in Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, after his temporary ousting by the board. Microsoft has a substantial investment in OpenAI, totaling around $13 billion, which gives it a claim to 49% of any profits generated by the AI company.\n\nThe FTC's probe into Microsoft's arrangement with Inflection AI highlights growing regulatory vigilance in the AI industry.

Thanks to its focus on the emerging technology, the software giant is the world's most valuable company by market capitalisation.\n\nHot on the heels of Microsoft is Nvidia, which became the world's second most valuable company yesterday (5 June) after crossing the $3trn mark and overtaking Apple. The company has been providing a bulk of the powerful chips needed to develop generative AI models.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI is currently arguably the world's leading AI company, taking the lead on its development after releasing ChatGPT last year. OpenAI has strong ties with Microsoft and is heavily reliant on Nvidia hardware.\n\nNow, the two US regulators want to probe whether deals existing between the trio give them an unfair advantage. The report suggests that the Justice Department will take the lead on investigating Nvidia under antitrust laws while the FTC will look into deals struck between Microsoft and OpenAI, valued in the billions.\n\nThis comes as US regulators are working on another high-profile Big Tech investigation into Apple, which was slammed with a major antitrust lawsuit in March over its alleged monopolistic habits. The European Commission fined Apple more than \u20ac1.8bn in the same month.\n\nAnd just weeks ago, Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment were slammed with a civil antitrust lawsuit by the US Justice Department for having a monopoly over and thwarting competition in the live entertainment industry.\n\nThe latest investigation stems from US regulators' fears that the development of AI - and those behind it - needs to be checked before the technology can have a large-scale negative impact on humanity. Earlier this year, the UN adopted a landmark US-led resolution on the promotion of \"safe, secure and trustworthy\" AI systems.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

Ted Shelton, its new COO, told the publication that it still operates as an independent company under new leadership.\n\nThe FTC has already sent out subpoenas to both Microsoft and Inflection, asking for relevant documents over the past two years. If it does determine that the companies entered into an agreement in a way that would give Microsoft control over the other while dodging regulatory review, then Microsoft could be fined, and the transaction could be suspended pending a more in-depth investigation.\n\nMicrosoft provided Engadget with the following statement: \"Our agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio. We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations.\"\n\nUS federal agencies have been cracking down on monopolistic practices by the world's largest tech companies over the past few years. To be even more efficient in conducting antitrust investigations involving the current biggest players in artificial intelligence, the agencies have also just struck a deal on how they're dividing their responsibilities. The Justice Department will take the lead in investigations involving NVIDIA, while the FTC will take charge of antitrust probes involving Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Investors in Inflection were assured that they would be reimbursed over time with sales profits.\n\nThe commission recently issued civil subpoenas to Microsoft and Inflection for documents dating back about two years. According to the individual, the commission is investigating whether Microsoft negotiated a deal that would give it ownership of Inflection while avoiding an FTC examination of the transaction.\n\nCompanies must report purchases for more than $119 million to federal antitrust enforcement authorities, who can assess the deal's impact on competition.\n\nSuppose an inquiry reveals that a merger or other investment will significantly diminish competition or result in a monopoly. In that case, the FTC or the Justice Department, which share antitrust power, can sue to halt the transaction.\n\nOfficials might request that a court punish Microsoft and delay the transaction while the FTC launches a full-scale inquiry into the deal's impact on competition.\n\nRead Also: Microsoft Windows Recall: Security Experts Worried of Privacy Risks, Demos How Easily Data Can Be Accessed\n\nThe FTC has already begun investigating AI investments made by major corporations such as Microsoft and Alphabet, which owns Google.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan is concerned that tech behemoths may eventually purchase or dominate the most successful AI applications, giving them a firm hold on systems with humanlike skills to talk, produce art, and write computer code.\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the case and papers reviewed by sources, the FTC is now looking into Microsoft's contract with Inflection to learn how and why they arranged their relationship.\n\nThe investigation follows just a month after British competition regulators announced plans to review recent AI partnerships involving Microsoft due to concerns that they might hinder AI competition.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said at the time that it would examine Microsoft's partnership with French business Mistral AI and its employment of key employees from Inflection AI.\n\nThe growing public and corporate interest in AI technology has prompted big tech companies to invest heavily in generative AI firms. However, antitrust investigators are looking into these transactions. The CMA said it would engage with interested third parties before commencing a comprehensive antitrust investigation.\n\nMicrosoft agreed to comply with the CMA, claiming that talent acquisition and fractional investments in AI businesses promote competition and are not mergers.\n\nMicrosoft hired Mustafa Suleyman of Inflection, a co-founder of Google's DeepMind AI unit, to oversee its consumer AI department in March. MS collaborated with Mistral earlier this year after working with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which is also under CMA inspection.\n\nMistral has vowed to cooperate with the CMA throughout the investigation to retain its independence and market access.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aldohn_domingo@techtimes.com", "name": "Aldohn Domingo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lina Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Suleyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mustafa Suleyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_regulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition regulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/447249/820/0/0/0/china-us-diplomacy-crime-computers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.\n\nThe agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week.\n\nSpokespeople for the DOJ, FTC, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the FTC is retaining its authority over Amazon and the DOJ is retaining its authority over Google, the people said. While both of those companies have already been hit with antitrust lawsuits, AI-related investigations into both were also held up pending an agreement, the people said.\n\nSpokespeople for Amazon and Google did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the division of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI late Wednesday. POLITICO reported in January that the FTC and DOJ were negotiating over who would investigate Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nThe two agencies share antitrust enforcement in the U.S. and must clear any investigation with their counterpart prior to starting. That process is typically perfunctory and done along industry lines, though in tech markets, the lines are blurred.\n\nOver the last 18 months, both FTC Chair Lina Khan and DOJ antitrust head Jonathan Kanter have said it is crucial to ensure that the rapidly evolving field of AI not be controlled by just a handful of companies in the same way they believe that happened with social media, online advertising, commerce, search, and other high-tech offerings over the last 15 years.\n\nThe FTC is conducting studies of the cloud computing market and the AI investments of Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Last week, the DOJ hosted a day-long workshop at Stanford University about competition and AI. The FTC also recently held an AI workshop.\n\nAt issue is the so-called AI stack, which includes high-performance semiconductors, massive cloud computing resources, data for training large language models, the software needed to integrate those components and consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.\n\nThe jurisdictional split between the two agencies previously came to a head most prominently in 2019 when then-FTC Chair Joseph Simons and then-DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim reached a handshake deal to allow the FTC to pursue monopolization investigations into Meta (then Facebook) and Amazon, while the DOJ would handle investigations of Google and Apple. That agreement was also reached after roughly a year of negotiations, according to people with knowledge of the process.\n\nSince then, all four companies have faced antitrust lawsuits, with a pair of cases against Google being the most advanced. Following a 10-week trial last fall, a ruling is pending before a federal judge in Washington over whether Google illegally monopolized the search market.\n\nArtificial intelligence has existed in some form for years, including the Siri voice assistant on iPhones. But it exploded into public consciousness in late 2022 with the rollout of generative AI, including OpenAI's ChatGPT. The products produce text, art, videos and answer questions in a strikingly human-like fashion.\n\nMicrosoft has put billions of dollars into OpenAI over the last several years. OpenAI is using Microsoft's vast computing resources to develop its technology, and the software giant is integrating OpenAI's services into its core businesses, including the Bing search engine. Regulators around the world are concerned that the investment was structured to avoid statutory merger reviews and that the partnership will give the two companies an unfair leg up on competitors.\n\nNvidia's profits have exploded over the last few years as its chips, traditionally used for computer graphics, have been adapted for the heavy computational workloads of AI. The company is estimated to have as much as 90% of the market for high-end AI chips, which are often difficult to obtain. The French antitrust agency is already investigating Nvidia, according to press reports.\n\nNvidia has faced criticism from customers and competitors for its sales tactics, which some say lock them in at the expense of other options, as well as how it bundles essential related software to the chips, according to two people in the industry.\n\nAt the event at Stanford last week, the DOJ's Kanter warned that while \"AI has so much promise,\" it also has \"unique characteristics that pose new threats to the markets for human ideas and innovation.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

It has invested up to $13bn in the for-profit subsidiary, giving OpenAI - which launched ChatGPT in late 2022 - a valuation of around $29bn.\n\nLast year, chief executive Sam Altman was ousted in a shock move. But a number of investors, including Microsoft, pushed for his reinstatement and he was rehired just days later.

Last year, the FTC launched a probe into OpenAI over claims it had put personal data at risk.

It previously investigated OpenAI's data collection practices, and in January, it began a broader inquiry into tech giants' partnerships with AI startups, like Microsoft and OpenAI, and Google and Anthropic (another AI company).\n\nThe FTC and Justice Department have reportedly finalised their agreement within the past week. FTC Chair Lina Khan said that their focus is on identifying potential AI issues early to avoid future complications.\n\nThe agency is trying to spot \"potential problems at the inception rather than years and years and years later, when problems are deeply baked in and much more difficult to rectify,\" Khan said.\n\nNotably, Microsoft and Nvidia are first and second companies with respect to their market cap, followed by Apple -- which is rumoured to announce AI partnership with OpenAI -- and Google.\n\nNot only in the US, OpenAI and Microsoft partnership have also come into the spotlight in other markets such as the UK and the European Union (EU) but Europe opted against a formal probe.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

If the form is different but the substance is the same, then we will not hesitate to act,\" he said.\n\nIf the FTC finds that Microsoft should have reported the deal to regulators, the watchdog could ask a court to fine Microsoft or pause the deal while the FTC conducts a full-blown investigation and assesses how it impacts competition, per the WSJ.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith told the FT that it didn't buy Inflection because \"we didn't want to own the company.\" Instead, he said, Microsoft \"wanted to hire some of the people who worked at the company.\"\n\nKanter also said urgent scrutiny is needed over Big Tech's control over AI.\n\nWhen the Microsoft and Inflection deal was announced, spectators questioned whether this deal laid out a new blueprint for Big Tech to avoid the scrutiny of antitrust regulators.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of investment firm Atreides Management, said on X: \"If the Microsoft/Inflection deal stands, then this is the roadmap for every large tech company to make acquisitions.\"\n\nMicrosoft, Inflection AI, and the FTC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, made outside of normal working hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jyoti_mann@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Jyoti Mann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Smith_(American_lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Smith (American lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/66616976cc442a2f676e6b39-scaled.jpg?ver=1717668232", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)U.S. antitrust enforcers have decided to investigate the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom, according to people familiar with the pending actions. The Department of Justice will launch an investigation of chipmaker Nvidia, while the Federal Trade Commission will scrutinize close business partners Microsoft and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, according to two people who were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigations and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment Thursday. Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Times was first to report Thursday on a deal between antitrust regulators at the two agencies. Emboldened by President Joe Biden's push for tougher scrutiny of Big Tech's business practices, federal officials have signaled for more than a year that they've been watching out for monopolistic behavior in the rapidly advancing industry of chatbots and other generative AI products that can produce human-like text, imagery and sound. Lina Khan, chair of the FTC, said in January that the agency would scrutinize deals that \"enable dominant firms to exert undue influence or gain privileged access in ways that could undermine fair competition.\"\u009d The FTC said at the time it was opening an inquiry into the relationships between leading artificial intelligence startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic and cloud computing providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft that have invested billions of dollars into them. Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI has been particularly close, supplying the smaller San Francisco company with the vast computing resources needed to train generative AI systems like ChatGPT. The entire AI industry has also relied heavily on Nvidia's specialized semiconductors to power AI applications. Demand for its AI chips has led Nvidia's stock to soar, surpassing $3 trillion in market value Wednesday and making it one of the most valuable companies in the S&P 500. - - - Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report. -

So growth for 2024 and 2025 has been revised upwards to 0.8% and 1.0% respectively.\n\nHowever, 2026's growth forecast is unchanged, at 1.0%, with the BCC warning that \"a poor outlook for exports\" is dragging on growth, while high interest rates continue to limit investment.\n\nVicky Pryce, who chairs the BCC economic advisory council, said:\n\n\"The BCC's latest forecast shows there is life in the UK economy but if it is to gain momentum then it must be nurtured.\n\n\"With interest rates expected to be cut at a modest pace and pay outstripping inflation, businesses will be holding onto much of their money - even as confidence rises after the mini-recession.\n\n\"As we enter the final weeks of the general election campaign, businesses will be watching for politicians to show they have sustainable long term economic plans.\n\n\"These must play to the UK's strengths and give companies confidence.\"\n\nShare UK statistics watchdog to investigate Sunak's use of term 'economy going gangbusters'\n\nPhillip Inman\n\nThe UK's statistics watchdog has opened an investigation into remarks made by Rishi Sunak about the economy \"going gangbusters\" amid concerns that politicians could misuse economic data in the run-up to the election.\n\nSir Robert Chote, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, will examine whether the prime minister repeated comments that were \"taken out of context\" and exaggerated the Conservative party's economic record.\n\nThe phrase \"going gangbusters\" was used by an official at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) during a briefing about the economy with journalists before becoming the basis of a Daily Mail front page story last month. A week later Sunak, in an interview on the Radio 4 Today programme, repeated the term.\n\nMore here....\n\nShare German industrial orders fall again\n\nBack in the eurozone, German factories have suffered another drop in orders.\n\nGerman industrial orders dropped by 0.2% in April, missing expectations of a rise of 0.6%. That's the fourth monthly drop in a row.\n\nIt indicates that manufacturing in Europe's largest economy hasn't made a strong start to 2024; perhaps a cut to interest rates might help...\n\nThe decline was due to a drop in large-scale orders in April.\n\nThat included a 15.4% decline in demand for 'other transport equipment' such as aircraft, ships, trains.\n\nThere was aso a 5.1% drop in the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products, while electrical equipment orders fell 4.1%, and the manufacture of machinery and equipment dropped by 1.5%.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 09.36 CEST\n\nWSJ: FTC opens antitrust inquiry into Microsoft AI deal\n\nIn a third AI development this morning, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Microsoft deliberately structured a takeover deal to avoid a government antitrust review.\n\nThe transaction in question involved AI startup Inflection. In March, Microsoft announced an unusual licening deal in which it paid $650m to use Inflections models and hired most of its staff, including its co-founders.\n\nThe FTC is concerned that this allowed Microsoft to swerve a rule that acquisitions valued at more than $119m must be reported to to federal antitrust-enforcement agencies, who could choose to investigate the impact on competition.\n\nThe WSJ says:\n\nThe FTC is now drilling down on Microsoft's deal with Inflection, seeking information about how and why they negotiated their partnership, according to a person familiar with the matter and records viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCivil subpoenas the commission sent recently to Microsoft and Inflection seek documents going back about two years. The agency is trying to determine whether Microsoft crafted a deal that would give it control of Inflection but also dodge FTC review of the transaction, the person said.\n\nIf the agency finds that Microsoft should have reported and sought government review of its deal with Inflection, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against Microsoft. Officials could ask a court to fine Microsoft and suspend the transaction while the FTC conducts a full-scale investigation of the deal's impact on competition.\n\nUK authorities are also interested in the deal. In April, the Competitions and Markets Authority announced an investigation into Microsoft's \"hiring of certain former employees of Inflection AI\" and \"its entry into associated arrangements with Inflection AI\"....\n\nShare US antitrust enforcer says 'urgent' scrutiny needed over Big Tech's control of AI\n\nElsewhere this morning, the top US antitrust enforcer has pledged to look \"with urgency\" at the artificial intelligence sector.\n\nJonathan Kanter has told the Financial Times about his concerns that power over the transformative technology is being concentrated among a few deep-pocketed players.\n\nKantar cited \"monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape\" in AI, such as thecomputing power and the data used to train large language models, to cloud service providers, engineering talent and access to essential hardware such as graphics processing unit chips (where Nvidia has such power).\n\nThe FT explains:\n\nRegulators are concerned that the nascent AI sector is \"at the high-water mark of competition, not the floor\" and must act \"with urgency\" to ensure that already dominant tech companies do not control the market, Kanter said.\n\nSometimes the most meaningful intervention is when the intervention is in real time,\" he added. \"The beauty of that is you can be less invasive.\"\n\nShare US clears way for antitrust inquiries of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI\n\nSome of the biggest players in the artificial intelligence field are facing the prospect of an antitrust investigation.\n\nUS regulators have cleared the way for antitrust inquiries into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, according to reports this morning, as they intensify their scrutiny of AI.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal to split responsibility for investigating the three major players in AI.\n\nOnce completed, probably in the coming days, the deal will mean the DoJ will take the lead investigating Nvidia, whose chips are driving the AI revolution, and whose market capitalisation hit $3trn last night.\n\nThis leaves the FTC with the task of examining OpenAI, maker of the ChatGPT chatbot, which has received billions of dollars of investment and support from Microsoft, which owns 49% of its shares.\n\nNvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft are in the spotligh due to concerns over their dominance of the AI space, and worries that. artificial intelligence will cost millions of jobs, and that safety oversight within the industry is weak.\n\nThe move shows that the AI industry faces growing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBack in January, the FTC launched an inquiry on Thursday into investments and partnerships made by some of the biggest companies in the generative artificial intelligence space.\n\nJust last week, US antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter told a conference that there are structures and trends in AI that should give us pause'\".\n\nKanter, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division at the Department of Justice, explained:\n\nAI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage.\n\nPowerful network effects may enable dominant firms to control these new markets, and existing power in the digital economy may create a powerful incentive to control emerging innovations that will not only impact our economy, but the health and well-being of our society and free expression.\n\nShare Introduction: ECB expected to cut rates today\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\n\nThe European Central Bank is poised to join a select group today, by lowering borrowing costs across the eurozone.\n\nFollowing heavy hints in recent weeks, economists widely agree that the ECB will vote to lower its key interest rates at a governing council meeting in Frankfurt today.\n\nA cut makes sense, as inflation across the eurozone has cooled this year - to 2.6% in May. It would start to unwind a tightening cycle that began in summer 2022, and which has pushed the ECB's deposit rate to a record high.\n\nThe decision comes at 1.15pm UK time; the money markets this morning show that a rate cut is a 92% probability, with just 8% chance of no change.\n\nIf that's accurate, the ECB would join Sweden and Switzerland, who lowered their interest rates in recent months, and Canada, which yesterday became the first G7 country to cut rates in this cycle.\n\nIt would mean, unusually, the ECB easing policy before the US Federal Reserve.\n\nEconomists and traders are also looking for hints as to how quickly the ECB might continue to ease policy in the coming months.\n\nInflation actually rose in May, up from 2.4% in April, which has created some uncertainty over whether underlying price pressures have been subdued.\n\nHenk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, commented:\n\n\"After nine months of keeping rates on hold, we expect the European Central Bank to embark on a rate-cutting cycle at its meeting on Thursday, 6 June. A quarter-point reduction across its policy rates, the first cut since 2019, is anticipated.\n\nOur view is that the Governing Council's rationale will likely be driven by a stronger-than-expected recovery in activity and increased confidence that inflation will return to the targeted level. Beyond the June meeting, we forecast that we could see quarter-point cuts in September and December. In addition, we expect to see 75 basis points of cuts next year, with the deposit rate finishing 2025 at 2.5%.\"\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank told clients that the question is, \"what comes after June?\", adding:\n\nThe cut will set the new direction for policy but with economic momentum outperforming expectations and domestic inflation proving sticky in 2024, the ECB can afford to take things slowly and let the data set the parameters of the easing cycle.\n\nThe agenda\n\n9.30am BST: UK construction PMI report for May\n\n9.30am BST: UK economic activity and business insights data\n\n1.15pm

The agreement gives each agency authority to open an antitrust probe into the company's conduct as well as recent deals related to it.\n\nAs part of that, the FTC has opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection's staff.\n\nThe DOJ and FTC declined to comment. Representatives for Microsoft and Inflection didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, Google and Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nThe Justice Department and FTC jointly enforce US antitrust laws and work together to coordinate which agency will investigate mergers and anticompetitive conduct through a process internally known as clearance. High-profile matters, such as those involving Google, have previously caused bitter clearance disputes between the agencies.\n\nThe New York Times reported the news earlier.\n\nThe European Union also looked at Microsoft's investment in OpenAI but ultimately decided against a formal probe. The UK's competition watchdog has also said it would examine the partnership but separately decided last month that a Microsoft deal with French AI company Mistral AI doesn't qualify for an investigation.\n\n--With assistance from Jackie Davalos-bsp-person> and Davey Alba-bsp-person>.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

The investigations will scrutinize these influential companies' roles in the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) industry, focusing on their business practices rather than mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe FTC will lead the inquiries into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ will concentrate on Nvidia. This development was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe AI industry has seen rapid growth, with startups like OpenAI and Anthropic -- creators of the ChatGPT and Claude chatbots, respectively -- gaining momentum in the generative AI sector. In response, tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are in a fierce race to integrate AI technologies to maintain their competitive edge in a market projected to exceed $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade.\n\nMicrosoft's involvement in AI is substantial, beginning with a $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019, which has now ballooned to approximately $13 billion. Microsoft's Copilot chatbot and various open-source models on its Azure cloud platform heavily rely on OpenAI's technology.\n\nRead more: UK Competition Watchdog Investigates Microsoft-OpenAI Partnership\n\nThe substantial financial commitments from companies like Microsoft are driven by the high costs associated with developing and training AI models. These processes require thousands of specialized chips, predominantly supplied by Nvidia. Meta, for instance, is investing billions in Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to support its AI model, Llama, contributing to Nvidia's impressive year-over-year revenue growth of over 250%.\n\nThe announcement of these antitrust investigations comes shortly after an open letter was published by a group of current and former OpenAI employees. The letter expressed concerns over the AI industry's rapid advancements and the lack of oversight, highlighting the absence of whistleblower protections for those within the industry.\n\n\"AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" the employees wrote. They criticized the current regulatory framework, noting that companies \"currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\"\n\nThis news also follows the FTC's January decision to conduct a comprehensive study on major AI industry players, including Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Anthropic, and OpenAI.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OpenAI-Microsoft-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The Redmond, Washington-based giant has had regulators looking at it since news broke of its $10 billion megadeal with OpenAI -- in the biggest startup funding round of 2023 in any sector.\n\nPer news reports, the FTC probe will also look into Microsoft's deal in March with Inflection AI to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hire most of its staff.\n\nThe deal -- seemingly framed in a way to get around any regulatory hurdles since it is not officially an acquisition -- once again showed the tech titan's insatiable appetite for all things AI.\n\nWhile specific details about both investigations remain sparse, the FTC reportedly is looking at both the conduct of Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ will examine the behavior of Nvidia, whose AI chips dominate the market.\n\nThe probes could have an impact on AI startups. Both Nvidia and Microsoft have been huge investors in startups in the sector, and both could move away from such deals as regulators look over their deals in the industry.\n\nIf that happens, venture funding could hit another lull. In May, companies in the AI sector raised 40% of venture funding for the month with $12.5 billion invested across more than 250 companies, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data.\n\nxAI raised close to half of that amount in a single round.", "source": {"uri": "news.crunchbase.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crunchbase News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_metinko@news.crunchbase.com", "name": "Chris Metinko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/AI-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

However, this practice has landed it in legal trouble with several governmental bodies due to antitrust concerns. Microsoft had a deal with Inflection AI, and the FTC launched a probe into it to see if it dodged antitrust laws.\n\nWhen a larger company wants to acquire the talent and resources from another company, it typically acquires it. However, it appears that Microsoft took another approach to getting Inflection AI's talent. Back in March, Microsoft hired nearly every employee in the company. Along with that, the Redmond company also paid Inflection AI $650 million to acquire the license to its technology. It's a classic multi-trillion-dollar corporation move.\n\nAs you may know, the U.S. FTC keeps an eye on big businesses to make sure that they're not making it harder for competition to flourish. As such, when a company spends more than $119 million to buy a company, it's required to report it to the FTC.\n\nThe thing is that Microsoft didn't acquire Inflection AI (technically). It just hired most of its employees and paid it $650 million to license its technology; it's different... kinda. Let's face facts, on its surface, it seems that Microsoft pulled this move to acquire the company's talent and tech without actually buying it. We can guess that, if Microsoft bought Inflection AI, it would have been to the tune of $650 million, the same amount it paid to acquire the license.\n\nSince it's not an official acquisition, Microsoft didn't technically need to report it to the FTC and deal with a possible block. If the FTC feels that a deal impacts competition in a market, it will sue to block the deal.\n\nNow, The FTC is looking into this move that Microsoft pulled to see if the company did this to avoid a possible lawsuit. It launched a probe into this deal. If Microsoft assumes control over the company in the deal, then it could be found in violation of antitrust laws. Hiring the majority of a company's employees and licensing its tech is essentially buying a company without buying it. The only difference is the ink on the contracts.\n\nMicrosoft claims that, while it hired all of its employees, Inflection AI still remains an independent company. It issued a statement to Engadget: \"Our agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio. We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations.\"\n\nSo, we're going to have to wait to see how this turns out. Not only is Microsoft a mega-corporation, but it already has OpenAI's technology under its belt. How much is the company going to throw its weight around to push ahead in this AI race?", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arthur_brown@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Arthur Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacorporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megacorporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AH-Microsoft-Logo-2-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It comes as The Wall Street Journal reports the FTC is probing whether Microsoft structured a deal with Inflection AI in a way to intentionally avoid regulator scrutiny.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance, \"Our agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio. We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations.\"\n\nYahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan breaks down what the investigations could mean for the companies.\n\nAll regulators are cracking down on Big Tech A I ventures.\n\nThe DOJ and FTC reportedly planning probes into NVIDIA.\n\nOpen A I and Microsoft.\n\nWe also got the Wall Street Journal saying that the FTC has issued Microsoft A subpoena for more information about those A I deals.\n\nYahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan has the details on that.\n\nSo yeah, the reporting is that the agencies that regulate antitrust in the US that they found a way to divvy up the work.\n\nSo in this case, the Doj taking look at Nvidia's antitrust uh potential violations.\n\nUh Nothing there yet.\n\nThis is just a probe and then the FTC taking on open A I and Microsoft and Microsoft has that $13 billion investment in Open A I.\n\nSo uh maybe A 24 there and it makes sense to split them up that way.\n\nNow we knew back in January that the FTC had opened an investigation into Microsoft's investment in Open A I as well as Google's investment and relationship with anthropic uh arrival.\n\nThere also lie.\n\nThe FTC had opened an investigation into open A is conduct.\n\nWhat is its conduct as far as being scrutinized by antitrust laws.\n\nBut what's different here today is that the Wall Street Journal has a report saying that the FTC has officially uh taking a look, they're opening a probe to look at Microsoft's licensing deal with inflection A I.\n\nSo the company, what the concern is reportedly is that Microsoft is paying uh licensing fee to resell Inflections products.\n\nSo $650 million there to do that.\n\nBut the concern reportedly is that they also hired the company's staff, most of its staff, its co founder.\n\nAnd the question there is whether that was a deal made to skirt anti trust rules which under heart Scott Redo require companies that are merging that are going to be acquired or acquire or just joint ventures.\n\nThat threshold there is a is 100 and $19.5 million.\n\nSo anything above that, that's the point at which you have to tell the FTC and the DOJ what you are doing, what your intentions are.\n\nAnd so the question is, is this masquerading this licensing deal as something else that should have been reported?\n\nSo some pressure there, uh so we'll have to take a look at what transpires.\n\nThis is just a starting place.\n\nBut uh these are definitely probes that FTC chair, Lina Khan and Jonathan Cantor over at the Antitrust Division at the DOJ have said they want to get ahead of this space.\n\nThey don't want A I to run amok and not be scrutinized in the way that prior tech eras have been.\n\nRight.\n\nI mean, that's the kind of very friendly reporter way of saying the social media, the social media didn't necessarily regulate it quickly enough.\n\nAnd interesting to see whether or not they are going to be able to kind of change the timeline this time around Alexis.\n\nThank you so much for bringing us your great reporting there.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The agency reportedly wants to get information on how and why this partnership between the two companies came about.\n\nThe goal of this reported probe is to find out if Microsoft created a deal that would give it control over Inflection AI but still keep the FTC from launching a more formal investigation into the partnership. While Microsoft did hire most of Inflection AI's team members and paid them money to license their tech, it did not acquire the company.\n\nIf the FTC does believe the deal could still violate antitrust rules, it could launch a deeper investigation. It could also ask the courts to suspend the deal between Microsoft and Inflection AI while its probe is conducted.\n\nInflection AI's COO Ted Shelton is quoted as saying he was unaware of the FTC's informal probe into the deal with Microsoft.

Civil subpoenas the commission sent recently to Microsoft and Inflection seek documents going back about two years. The agency is trying to determine whether Microsoft crafted a deal that would give it control of Inflection but also dodge FTC review of the transaction, the person said.\n\nIf the agency finds that Microsoft should have reported and sought government review of its deal with Inflection, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against Microsoft. Officials could ask a court to fine Microsoft and suspend the transaction while the FTC conducts a full-scale investigation of the deal's impact on competition.\n\nDetails aside - which always sounded off, based on the reporting around the deal, but which we're now going to get a lot more info about with these subpoenas - the weirdest thing about the deal was how brazen it seemed. Microsoft had to know how this would look, regardless. And they were just a few months removed from the key role they played in the turmoil at their other massive bet in the space, OpenAI. It was like shooting off flare guns in a sea of \"nothing to see here\".\n\nSpeaking of \"nothing to see here\":\n\nInflection is continuing operations under a new management team but pivoted away from Pi, a consumer product, and toward services for corporate clients.\n\nTed Shelton, Inflection's new chief operating officer, said he wasn't aware of an FTC investigation.

They are to investigate their influence on the AI sector.\n\nIt comes as the European Commission and the UK's CMA are still looking into partnerships between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers that could lead to intrusive and lengthy investigations in their market power.\n\nAntitrust investigations\n\nAccording to the CNBC report, the FTC will take the lead on looking into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DoJ will focus on Nvidia, and the investigations will focus on the companies' conduct, rather than mergers and acquisitions, according to the source.\n\nThe investigations come due to the positions of the three tech players in the AI sector.\n\nMicrosoft for example has invested up to $13 billion in ChatGPT owner OpenAI, which allows Redmond to utilise the AI technology for its Copilot chatbot, as well as its Azure cloud service.\n\nNvidia meanwhile has controls roughly 80 percent of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps Nvidia achieve gross margins between 70 and 80 percent.\n\nThat kind of margin has recently helped Nvidia become the second most tech firm in the world (ahead of Apple), after it added $1 trillion to its market value in as little time as three months.\n\nOther players\n\nWhile OpenAI, Microsoft and Nvidia can be considered as among the leading AI players, there are a number of other tech firms working equally as hard in the AI sector.\n\nThese include the likes of Amazon-backed Anthropic, as well as Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms.\n\nAll of these players are also ramping up their own AI offerings and services.\n\nEarlier this week, a group of current and former OpenAI, Google DeepMind employees published an open letter to warn of the \"serious risks\" of AI, and the lack of safety oversight in AI industry.

In a joint statement, the two federal agencies said that they would investigate the influence of all three companies in the AI value chain and if they had violated extant antitrust laws. According to sources speaking to the New York Times, which broke the story, the DoJ will be tasked with investigating Nvidia, while the FTC will probe the activities of Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nNeither federal agency has yet commented on the news (Tech Monitor has reached out to both agencies and the aforementioned companies for statements.) But in an interview earlier this year, FTC chair Lina Khan highlighted the department's growing interest in competition throughout the field of AI. According to Khan, the FTC was trying to identify \"potential problems at the inception\" of the market, \"rather than years and years and years later, when problems are deeply baked in and much more difficult to rectify.\"\n\nThe announcement of the FTC and DoJ's antitrust investigation echoes a similar probe launched by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) earlier this year. In that inquiry, the CMA said it had identified an \"interconnected web\" of 90 investments and partnerships with AI startups clustered around just six big tech firms: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Nvidia.\n\nThose companies, pronounced CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell, \"already hold positions of market power in many of today's most important digital markets [and] could profoundly shape these new markets to the detriment of fair, open and effective competition, ultimately harming businesses and consumers.\"\n\nFor their part, the FTC and the DoJ have already displayed a keen interest in AI, for good and ill. In January, the former launched an inquiry into the AI partnerships of Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. The FTC has also announced an enforcement action against at least one firm for misusing facial recognition technology, launched a \"Voice Cloning Challenge\" to promote awareness of deepfake audio, launched an investigation into Reddit for its decision to open up user-generated content to AI training sets and strongly warned against companies using location or health data to develop new models.\n\nThe DoJ has been just as active. In February, deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said that prosecutors from the agency would \"seek stiffer sentences for offences made significantly more dangerous by the misuse of AI.\" DoJ antitrust tsar Jonathan Kanter also warned firms to compensate artists when they used their work to train new AI models and from entering into partnership arrangements with startups where the former exercised monopsony power - a dynamic, he said, that would not be acceptable under US law.\n\nNot every AI partnership initially identified by regulators as worthy of investigation has resulted in sanctions. Last month, the CMA said that it would discontinue its sub-probe into the alliance between Microsoft and French startup Mistral AI. The decision was welcomed by the latter's US patron. \"Investment and partnership are essential to new players in the AI economy,\" a company spokesperson told Reuters. \"We welcome the CMA's determination that our fractional investment and partnership with Mistral AI does not qualify as a merger or acquisition.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other CMA investigations proceed apace. Earlier today the competition watchdog issued an update about its thinking so far about Microsoft Azure's role in shaping competition within the UK cloud market through its licensing practices. These, said the CMA, could potentially act as a source of friction for competition in the space, with the agency proposing several provisional remedies - including boosting the transparency of Azure's pricing.\n\nThe former head of ICT strategy delivery for the UK Cabinet Office, Nicky Stewart, welcomed the update. \"The emerging thinking around unfair software licensing, while by no means set in stone, seems pretty cut-dried: Microsoft is wielding market power,\" Stewart told Tech Monitor. \"It remains to be seen if the CMA will translate this into an actionable harm to the market.\"",

Since then, it has sued each of the tech firms on claims that they violated laws prohibiting the practice of monopoly and monopolistic competition.\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI evaded being investigated by the government for months. However, it changed when the three companies were reported to have put their efforts and resources in AI development, specifically in generative AI and hardware supporting it at least since late 2022.\n\nSeparately, an open letter released by a group of individuals claiming to have previously worked for OpenAI and Google DeepMind warned of the potential that excessive AI use and development could pose a risk that could cause human extinction.\n\nREAD NEXT: Microsoft Confirms Mixed Reality Layoffs Despite Still Selling HoloLens Headsets\n\nVCPost has been monitoring the recent developments regarding the three companies involved in the investigation, which could be seen as factors as to why the government launched the inquiries in the first place.\n\nMost recently, Nvidia reportedly surpassed Apple in becoming the second most-valuable company in the world behind Microsoft, after the AI chipmaker was valued at over $3 trillion.\n\nPart of the valuation could be traced to Elon Musk's semiconductor orders for its X and xAI platforms after an internal communication revealed that the Nvidia chips be redirected from Tesla to the social media platform and its AI server.\n\nLast May, it was revealed that Microsoft invested in OpenAI due to its fear that Google would dominate the AI scene.\n\nThe British Information Commissioner's Office also looked into Microsoft's AI feature Copilot, especially with its capability of capturing screenshots of users' computers every few seconds, which sparked security questions.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI made headlines in the tech world last month after it launched the latest iteration of its generative AI platform ChatGPT and made massive deals with Reddit and News Corp.\n\nThe company also received criticism from its former employees, including co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, former \"Superalignment\" safety team leader Jan Leike.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also embroiled in a final salary row with some separated employees who refused to sign non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements after he disqualified their quit pay claims. Altman eventually rescinded the order, saying that departing employees could be allowed to retain their vested equity without needing to sign such agreements.\n\nThe European Union's data protection task force further found out that there could be a potential risk regarding the use of ChatGPT and its compliance with the continental bloc's GDPR policy, especially with the company's revelation that it has detected and terminated disinformation campaigns from multiple countries, including Russia, China, Israel, and Iran.\n\nIt was also reported that Scarlett Johansson accused OpenAI and Altman of allegedly using her voice without her permission. It was revealed at the time that Altman reached out twice to agents of the actress, who currently portrays Natasha Romanoff in the MCU, to discuss the possibility of licensing her voice for ChatGPT.\n\nJohansson reportedly declined on both instances yet she was concerned that \"Sky,\" a female voice developed for the AI tool, resembled her and was developed without her explicit consent.", "source": {"uri": "vcpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Venture Capital Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_resurreccion@vcpost.com", "name": "Jose Resurreccion", "type": "author",

Following a similar agreement in 2019, the government investigated Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta and has since sued each for antitrust violations.\n\nFor months, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI largely escaped the weight of regulatory scrutiny from the Biden administration. But that began to change when generative artificial intelligence, capable of producing text, photos, videos, and audio similar to humans, burst onto the scene in late 2022 and created a frenzy in the industry.\n\nIn July, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation to determine if OpenAI had harmed consumers with its data collection. In January, the FTC also launched a broad investigation into strategic partnerships between tech giants and new Artificial Intelligence companies, including Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and Google and Amazon's investments in Anthropic, another young Artificial Intelligence company.\n\nHowever, the United States is lagging behind Europe in the regulation of artificial intelligence. European Union officials agreed last year on historic rules to regulate this rapidly evolving technology, focusing on the riskiest ways it can be used.\n\nNvidia, OpenAI, and Microsoft have been in the spotlight as some of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence boom, raising questions about their dominance.", "source": {"uri": "en.softonic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Softonic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Artificial_Worlds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Artificial Worlds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Companies", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://articles-img.sftcdn.net/t_article_cover_xl/auto-mapping-folder/sites/3/2024/06/Juicios-en-Estados-Unidos-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

That changed as generative AI started making headlines over the past two years, with these three companies at the forefront.\n\nMicrosoft tantalized regulators when it invested billions of dollars into OpenAI and reportedly acquired a 49% ownership stake in the company. The Times reports that Microsoft specifically structured this deal to avoid scrutiny from regulators, but having such significant influence over one of the AI industry's biggest players while also integrating the company's technology deeply into its own products and services attracted their attention anyway.\n\nAs for Nvidia, the chipmaker is the top provider of the GPUs that power many AI devices. Sales have grown exponentially in recent months, and the company's market cap hit $3 trillion for the first time this week, temporarily pushing it ahead of Apple.\n\nSources told NYT that industry players are worried about Nvidia locking customers into using its chips with its software and how it distributes those chips to consumers.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_siegal@bgr.com", "name": "Jacob Siegal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nvidia-Logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating the company over its strange deal to \"acqui-hire\" a burgeoning rival to OpenAI: the AI startup Inflection.\n\nThe tech giant paid Inflection a $650 million so-called \"licensing fee\" to use its AI models and hire most of its employees, including its CEO Mustafa Suleyman, in March. That chunk of money appeared to be aimed at appeasing Inflection's shareholders, giving them a return on their initial investment in the startup before sucking up the company's talent.\n\nInflection was started in 2023 by Suleyman, who's known for co-founding Google DeepMind, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Like Anthropic, Inflection is a Public Benefit Corporation, or B-Corp, meaning it's required to meet certain standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Inflection's chatbot Pi was launched as a \"supportive and compassionate\" alternative to rival products.\n\n\"Microsoft has taken the heart and lungs of this company,\" tech expert Scott Galloway said on his and tech journalist Kara Swisher's podcast Pivot at the time. Swisher added: \"There's gonna be lawsuits in the AI area... And there should be.\"\n\nSwisher's predictions may soon come to fruition. The FTC is investigating whether the company poached staffers and paid Inflection a \"licensing fee,\" rather than buying the company outright, in an attempt to avoid a government antitrust review, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson told Quartz in an email, \"Our agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\" They said the company takes its legal obligations seriously and is \"confident that we have complied with those obligations.\"\n\nSome experts agree. They see Microsoft's Inflection deal not a as problem, but rather a driver of innovation. Former General Counsel for the FTC Alden Abbott said in a statement that partnerships between small firms and big corporations such as Microsoft's with Inflection \"should be applauded.\"\n\nReferring to the probe into both Microsoft and a newly announced investigation into Nvidia over alleged anticompetitive practices in the AI space, Abbott said, \"By bringing complementary technologies on board, the two large established companies may be able to enhance their competition with the other big leading competitors in [the] AI space, including Google, Meta, and IBM.\"\n\n\"Such competition will tend to speed up innovation and introduce new and better technologies into [the] AI space, benefiting American consumers and technological advancement,\" he added. \"Preventing smaller firms from entering into partnerships with the large firms could by contrast slow innovation and consumer welfare enhancement.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors":

The agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week.\n\nRead more: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/06/federal-antitrust-probes-nvidia-microsoft-openai-00161973", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

The agreement is expected to be finalized in the coming days. Separately, the Wall Street Journal cited sources as saying that the FTC officials are scrutinizing a software licensing deal that Microsoft recently signed with Inflection AI Inc., an OpenAI competitor.\n\nThe FTC and the Justice Department are both tasked with antitrust enforcement tasks. According to Politico, the agencies must consequently receive approval from one another before launching a probe into potential competition law violations. The agreement that the FTC and the Justice Department reportedly reached about the potential probes into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI is said to be the fruit of a nearly year-long negotiation process.\n\nSources told the Times that the Justice Department will carry out the investigation into Nvidia. Industry players have reportedly \"grown worried\" about the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence processors. Those concerns reportedly focus on the software that Nvidia Corp. ships with its chips, as well as the way it distributes those chips to customers.\n\nThe investigation into Microsoft and OpenAI is expected to be led by the FTC. According to Politico, the probe will seek to determine whether the two companies have \"unfair advantages\" in the large language model market. Microsoft has reportedly provided OpenAI with $13 billion worth of capital and cloud infrastructure in return for a 49% stake.\n\nOpenAI faces competition from several heavily-funded LLM startups including Inflection AI. In March, Microsoft appointed Inflection AI co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mustafa Suleyman to lead its consumer AI group. Microsoft also hired most of the company's other employees as part of the deal, which reportedly cost it about $650 million.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported today that the FTC has opened a probe into the transaction. According to the paper's sources, the agency sent Microsoft and Inflection AI subpoenas asking for information about their partnership. FTC officials are reportedly looking to determine whether the companies structured the deal in a manner designed to avoid regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe FTC previously sued Amazon.com Inc. over the interface design of its Prime subscription service. The Justice Department, meanwhile, is pursuing an antitrust case against Google LLC over its practices in the search and search advertising markets.\n\nPolitico reported that \"AI-related investigations\" into both companies were held up prior to the agreement that the agencies reached today. Under the agreement, the FTC will continue leading the antitrust probe into Amazon while the Justice Department will be responsible for the probe focused on Google's search business.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/06/5565861715_0c07d9dfd4_b-768x512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629101", "eventUri": "eng-9629101", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 455393657, "relevance": 2}

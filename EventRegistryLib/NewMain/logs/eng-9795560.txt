Celebrities Don't, Apparently", "body": "Blake Lively is known for many things -- her hilarious social media interactions with husband Ryan Reynolds, her friendship with Taylor Swift, and, naturally, all the characters she has played throughout her career. Oh, and of course, her signature gorgeous blonde hair, usually falling in beautiful beachy waves. The actress recently revealed some of her hair secrets, specifically the fact that she doesn't use conditioner. So, should you use conditioner every day? If the celebs don't, what are they doing instead?\n\nIn an interview with Vogue about her new hair care line, Blake Brown Beauty, Lively said there's a big, easy-to-change difference between most people's hair and that of celebs: Famous people aren't using conditioner.\n\n\"I don't know anyone who uses conditioner in my industry,\" she said. \"It's not that people in the entertainment industry are gifted with better hair. We're using a different hair system than the process promoted to the mass market.\"\n\nWait... no conditioner?! To find out how much merit there is to Lively's revelation, Scary Mommy asked celebrity hairstylist Andrew Dylan to weigh in.\n\nLively's system requires no conditioner but, rather, two sets of shampoo and hair masks. One should focus on strengthening, and the other should be dedicated to hydration. Each time you shower, you'll swap which one you use, so your hair is getting both stronger and more hydrated over time. You'll just shampoo as usual -- maybe doing so twice if you have product buildup in your hair -- and then apply a mask for at least 30 seconds before rinsing it out.\n\nA hairstylist told Lively about this method after noticing her hair was damaged, and the actress says it saved her tresses.\n\nDylan says this process makes sense for celebrities getting their hair styled constantly, making it susceptible to dryness and breakage. \"Celebrities are usually having their hair heat styled most days, which can leave their strands dehydrated and damaged. Therefore, it's advised for them to use hair masks and treatments followed by a heat protector to keep hair healthy and shiny,\" he says.\n\nHer regimen may not be right for everyone. \"A hair routine is unique to each individual person and their hair type; not all products have the same results as it's all trial and error to get that perfect combination,\" says Dylan.\n\nShampoo is a must for most people to remove sweat, oil, dirt, and hair products from the scalp. Conditioners contain natural oils and proteins to make hair soft, shiny, and smooth, Dylan explains. In comparison, hair masks are much more concentrated than conditioners. They're formulated to hydrate and strengthen the hair, specifically color-treated or dry, damaged hair. If that sounds like you, you could definitely experiment with adding hair masks to your shower routine, at least every so often.\n\n\"If you're that person who heat styles daily, I'd advise starting to use a shampoo, a treatment, and conditioner. This way, you're giving your hair all the best chances to stay strong,\" says Dylan. You'll know it's working for your hair if it's shiny, healthy, and styling well. \"However, if you feel like your hair feels lank or heavy and you're not getting your usual bounce from using all three products, you should consider switching your products or trying to eliminate either the hair mask or conditioner.\"\n\nWondering where to start on your hair mask journey? Dylan likes the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate line, including their pre-shampoo treatment and hair mask -- it's \"a staple\" in his kit. \"The line is perfect for any hair type and is guaranteed to give you that mirror shine. For best results, use the trio (shampoo, conditioner, and treatment). For a quick fix, apply the treatment to your hair routine on fresh, damp hair before any heat styling,\" he says.\n\nHairstylists on TikTok also swear by Biolage Hydra Source Mask, Amika Soulfood Nourishing Hair Mask, and the Verb Manage + Restore Hydrating Mask. Women of color who want a mask tailored to their natural hair could try the K\u00e9rastase Nutritive Ultra-Hydrating Mask or Wella Professionals Fusion Intense Repair Conditioner, both of which are recommended on forums for salon professionals.\n\nSo, why not give it a try? Lively's hair doesn't lie, and maybe her system is just the thing your locks have been needing to take them to the next level. But if you give it a shot and notice your hair feels weighed down, don't be afraid to stick with your go-to conditioner.", "source": {"uri": "scarymommy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scary Mommy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairdresser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hairdresser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hair care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyling_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyling product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00e9rastase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00e9rastase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wella", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_salon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beauty salon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hair"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/8/5/60010cb5/los-angeles-ca-may.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

While brushing your hair you might notice more strands than ever coming out these days! As it turns out, when your hair starts thinning, your hairbrush could actually be doing more harm than good. Even if you're not part of the 50% of women over the age of 50 who experience thinning hair -- wouldn't we all like to prevent as much hair fallout as possible? So we reached out to hair experts and dermatologists to get the lowdown on the best hair brushes for thinning hair.\n\nWhy you should change your hair brush when hair begins to thin\n\nSo why exactly is it so important to switch out your old hair brush once hair starts thinning out? \"First off, the wrong brush can further contribute to hair loss,\" explains Ross Kopelman, MD, hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration in New York City. \"Especially if the brush causes unnecessary tension, breakage or damage to your hair and scalp.\" That's why the best hair brushes for thinning hair don't have harsh bristles, which can irritate the scalp and lead to inflammation that can exacerbate hair loss.\n\nWhat to avoid in a hair brush if you have thin hair\n\nWhen you notice your hair is shedding or thinning, it's important to avoid brushes made with rough materials like metal or really hard plastic. Also, when it comes to the best hair brushes for thinning hair, you want to skip ones that have too widely spaced bristles, which can pull on your hair too harshly, leading to breakage and even more thinning, says Dr. Ross. \"Brushes made with hard bristles can lead to excessive force as you try to pull them through hair,\" adds Tiffany Rose, hair expert and CEO and Founder of Hollywood Hair Bar, a hair product line of all-natural ingredients focusing on hair regrowth. \"This further harms hair by literally ripping it out.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a hair brush if you have thin hair\n\nGently brushing is key when it comes to thinning hair, but what type of brushes make this easiest to accomplish? \"For those with thinning hair, it's crucial to choose brushes that are gentle on fragile hair strands and the scalp,\" says Rose. \"These will be brushes with boar bristles, soft bristles or paddle brushes with a cushioned base.\"\n\nThe best hair brushes for thinning hair\n\nAll of the pros we spoke to say it's essential to choose a brush that is suitable for your specific hair type to minimize damage and promote healthy hair growth. Read on to discover the perfect one for you.\n\nBest hair brush for thinning hair if your hair is straight\n\nGoody Dream Detangle Paddle Brush\n\nA paddle brush with a soft, cushioned pad at the base of bristles puts less tension on straight hair while brushing. That's why Rose's top pick is the Goody Dream Detangle Paddle Brush. \"It's a reliable brand known for high-quality hair brushes,\" she says. The long, widely spaced nylon bristles gently smooth hair and remove tangles, and will gently massage and stimulate the scalp to promote healthy hair growth.\n\nBest hair brush for thinning hair if your hair is wavy\n\nPERFEHAIR 100% Wild Natural Boar Bristle Hair Brush\n\nA natural boar bristle brush, like Perfehair 100% Wild Boar Bristle Hair Brush, can smooth out wavy hair and help it keep its shape because the bristles won't cause too much friction or pull while brushing. But that's not the only reason a boar bristle brush is so perfect for thinning, wavy hair. \"This type of brush can help maintain hair health and reduce breakage,\" says Dr. Ross. \"Boar bristles are also gentle on the hair and scalp, but also help distribute natural oils from the scalp to the ends of the hair, and reduce static and frizz.\"\n\nBest hair brush for thinning hair if your hair is curly\n\nRizos Curls Detangling Flexi Brush\n\nFor curly hair that is more prone to breakage, Dr. Ross says you want soft bristles made of flexible materials like plastic or silicone to remove tangles without any tension or ripping. The Rizos Curls Detangling Flexi Brush is made with eight rows of bristles, which flex to move through hair, but it also has a lock bar to keep bristles in place if needed. Using the brush in the shower while working conditioner through hair can help battle knots while preventing breakage. \"Brushes with flexible bristles can be gentler and help detangle curly hair without causing damage,\" says Dr. Ross. What's more, he adds that brushes like this also provide a massaging effect. \"This is important because this can stimulate blood circulation to the scalp and promote hair growth.\"\n\nBest hair brush for thinning hair if your hair is super fine\n\nTangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler\n\nAs many women with fine hair know, if damp strands aren't brushed and smoothed out post shower, hair ends up a tangled mess once dry. This makes it even harder to brush hair out without excessive pulling. \"Brushing wet hair can apply additional tension on hair follicles,\" says Whitney Tolpinrud, MD, FAAD, dermatologist and Medical Director at Curology. \"When hair is already fragile, this stress can lead to even more breakage.\" That's why the Tangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler brush is known as 'The Holy Grail' of brushes on TikTok, where it is also often paired with the hashtag #BestBrush. \"Brushes like this are designed to detangle hair gently, without pulling or tugging,\" says Dr. Ross. The credit goes to a combination of shorter and longer bristles that can detangle knots smoothly. The brush has two tiers of soft and flexible plastic teeth -- the straight and widely spaced long bristles gently glide through hair and work out knots and the shorter teeth help smooth out strands.\n\nBonus: The best hair brush for thin hair that boosts hair growth\n\nHairmax Ultima 12 Lasercomb\n\nLaser therapy brushes are a great tool for combating hair loss. \"These brushes use low-level laser therapy that work to stimulate hair follicles through emitting infrared wavelengths and promote hair growth,\" says Dr. Ross. \"One laser therapy brush I highly recommend is the HairMax LaserComb.\" This brush combines the benefits of gentle brushing with the stimulation provided by laser therapy, helping to improve hair density and overall scalp health.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Choosing the right brush as well as taking care to gently use the brush can help manage thinning hair and reduce the risk of further hair loss. \"Always handle your hair gently, especially when it's wet,\" cautions Dr. Ross. \"And avoid excessive brushing, which will help maintain your hair's health and vitality.\" Now that you know which brush to choose from for the best hair brushes for thinning hair, your hair is sure to look more lush in no time.\n\nFor more hair tips and tricks, click through these stories:\n\nIs It Okay To Skip Conditioner in Your Hair Care Routine?

I'd overheard this being told amongst my mom's friends and when I came of age to make my own hair decisions my aunties and the women I looked to for beauty inspiration cautioned me against taking my 4C hair to anyone whose hair didn't look like mine.\n\nAs I've gotten older and put more and more distance between myself and this wise tale the risk and implications seemingly lessened. So, when I walked into the Dominican salon in my neighborhood for a press and curl and took in the smell of the burning hair, that was my only concern. With a trusted heat protectant in my hand, I felt comfortable putting my head in theirs. But somewhere between washing and conditioning, my virgin hair had been permed. I couldn't believe I had allowed my hair to be treated with such carelessness, throwing caution to the wind.\n\nAs a beauty editor, I'm tasked with testing products to provide an accurate valuation for our readers. So believe me when I say I've tried my fair share of hair care products. Despite this, I felt hopeless at managing the task of repairing my over-processed tresses. Since the unfortunate experience, I've introduced the Shea Moisture Bond Repair line into my routine. The line includes the shampoo, conditioner, masque, bonding oil, and leave-in conditioner.\n\nThe Amla Oil Bond Repair Masque is said to help prevent breakage and strengthen type three and type four hair and it has done just that for mine. If you've ever grown out a relaxer or treated damaged hair you know how tough it can be to care for the many hair types on your head. The coily strands require different care than the now straight strands and the brittle ends need more moisture than the curly hairs. Not to mention all of the new split ends!\n\nLuckily, after the first use of the bond repair masque, I found my hair slowly coming back to life. Not only that, but my wash days hadn't gotten longer despite making time to address the damage. After I double cleanse my hair of its hot oil pre-poo I apply the strengthening masque for 5 minutes, which leaves me with a more moisturized and manageable head of hair.

I mean, how many intricate braid looks and complex updos is one expected to know? Thankfully, my fellow editors and I are on the same page when it comes to styling our hair for the summer -- it needs to be easy, quick, and most importantly, cute. So I asked them to show me four foolproof hairstyles that fit the criteria. Not only did they share the steps needed to re-create these styles, but they also shared the trusty Sephora products they use for each one. From multitasking blow-dryers to TikTok's favorite styling cream, these hardworking products make these styles achievable no matter your skill level.\n\n\"Soft curls will never go out of style, but summer is the perfect time to rely on this low-fuss look. Since my natural texture is quite wavy and prone to frizz, a soft, tousled curl enhances my strand pattern while smoothing out any rough cuticles so my hair looks shiny and bouncy.\" -- Jamie Schneider, senior beauty editor\n\n\"After towel-drying my hair and before blow-drying it, I run Oribe's Supershine Moisturizing Cream through my strands. I immediately notice a difference in my hair's vibrance when I use this product -- the softness and shine this product gives is unmatched. Then I section my hair in half and use my Shark FlexStyle Multi-Styler's Oval Brush and Auto-Wrap Curlers to create soft, swoopy curls. This tool smooths, dries, and curls my hair all at the same time -- it literally cut my styling time in half. Once my hair is all curled, I give it a spritz with Moroccanoil's Luminous Hairspray. I receive so many compliments on how good my hair smells when I use this, and the hold lasts all day. I love that these soft curls are airy, bouncy, and defy frizz -- for me, that's the trifecta when it comes to summer hairstyles.\" -- Schneider\n\n\"Lately, I've been so inspired to embrace my curly hair. Some of my favorite influencers and celebs are putting the hot tools down and rocking their natural curls and waves. I like to think of this trend as going back to the basics and adopting a sort of 'less is more' approach to beauty. I cut my 10-step makeup routine in half for the summer, and I want to do the same for my hair. It's so freeing!\" -- Aniyah Morinia, editor\n\n\"When styling a wash-and-go, I always start with wet hair. My hair has low porosity and it's usually difficult for water and product to seep into my strands for full moisture, so I add about three pumps of the Pattern Palo Santo Curl Mousse and distribute from root to tip. With this product, I can immediately see a difference in both hydration and definition. My curls and ringlets go from puffy and undefined to smooth and coiled. I'm incredibly impatient when doing my hair, so if I can get instant results like this, I'm happy. Plus, the scent is absolutely divine. To finish off the look, I add the Ouai Anti-Frizz Hair Styling Cream, which protects my hair from NYC's brutal heat and humidity. I love this style because my hair isn't weighed down by a bunch of products and pins. Wearing my natural hair out feels like an opportunity to show up authentically, and I can't think of anything better than that. It's the key to a carefree summer.\" -- Morinia\n\n\"When I'm not air-drying my hair, I'm embracing a full '90s blowout. Who doesn't like feeling like a supermodel with bouncy hair? I may not be skilled in the hair department, but I can ace this style with my eyes closed. And if I can, anyone can.\" -- Caitie Schlisserman, group executive director\n\n\"Before any hot tools are used, you gotta prep your hair. After towel-drying, I spray the Fable & Mane Moisturizing Volume Spray all over, which helps thicken my hair and adds natural volume. It smells like a warm spicy hug -- it's intoxicating. Once my hair dries, I section it off and run the Mane It's Giving Body Round Brush through it. I start at the roots, hold the brush there for a few seconds, then continue down the length of my hair. This brush is very intuitive, and I love that it doesn't feel like I'm damaging my hair. Once I finish, I spray the Amika Rising Star Volumizing Finishing Spray on my roots to give my hair more bounce.\" -- Schlisserman\n\n\"Every hot girl has a slick-back hairstyle in the summer, and I'm right there with them. It looks so chic. I like this style with hair that's not freshly washed -- when my hair gets greasy, I know it's time to slick it back.\" -- Anneliese Henderson, senior editor\n\n\"I love how easy a slick-back style is, but I've gone through a lot of trial and error to find the best products to make it work. This Dae Styling Cream is the perfect option. It moisturizes, tames frizz and flyaways, and smells absolutely divine with notes of dragonfruit and prickly pear. I add a generous amount throughout my scalp and brush it all back into a ponytail holder. I run a bit more through the pony itself, and with what's left of my arm strength, I braid the ends.\" -- Henderson", "source": {"uri": "whowhatwear.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Who What Wear UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_walsh@whowhatwear.com", "name": "Emma Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frizz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frizz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Braid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cream (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuticle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuticle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephora", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sephora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursera_graveolens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bursera graveolens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringlet_(haircut)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ringlet (haircut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairspray_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hairspray (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hair_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural hair movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponytail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ponytail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opuntia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3gBuqKYXN53nUnWoT8oda-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It's all about knowing what ingredients are good and healthy for your body and what their concentration is in the product. All of the ingredients below should be listed within the top six ingredients of your product.\n\nAny lower than the top six ingredients and your hair may not reap the full benefits.\n\nThis butter is extracted from the nut fruit of the karite tree in West Africa. It is said to restore moisture to dry and brittle hair, prevent breakage and split ends, and promote healthy hair growth. No wonder it's a favourite among those in the natural hair community.\n\nBeauty tip: Apply this butter to damp hair in order to seal in moisture and leave the hair soft. You may also use shea butter on the ends of your hair to prevent split ends and as a general styling product.\n\nThis natural moisturiser is found in many shampoos and pomades. It helps to restore or maintain a healthy moisture balance. It can also soothe a dry and itchy scalp. The healing properties of aloe are amazing, so don't be afraid to apply this directly to a sore scalp.\n\nBeauty tip: Add aloe to a spray bottle with water and a natural oil of your choice for a homemade spray moisturiser.\n\nVitamin E is an all-natural, vegetable-derived preservative used in hair products to prevent other oils from going off. It's highly regarded for its moisturising benefits and is easily absorbed by the hair.\n\nBeauty tip: Add a few drops of this naturally preserving oil to any of your hair oil mixes and use as often as you like.\n\nJojoba oil most closely resembles the natural oil that the scalp produces, called sebum. It adds natural shine and soothes the scalp without weighing the hair down. An extremely light but beneficial natural oil is hard to come by, that's why this oil is pricey - but it's worth the extra bucks.\n\nHow to use it: Apply directly to a dry scalp or add a small amount to the hair from root to tip in order to restore the hair's natural shine.\n\nYou'll often find wheat protein in shampoos and conditioners that are formulated for damaged hair. It's derived from whole wheat and imparts shine to dry and distressed hair. Wheat protein is also great for consumers suffering from excessive breakage.\n\nBeauty tip: A conditioning treatment with wheat protein high on the list of ingredients will serve as a great strengthening protein treatment. Use this conditioner every week and follow up with moisture.\n\nHerbal extracts such as rosemary, lavender, peppermint, calendula and nettle are often added to hair products in small amounts for their moisturising or conditioning properties. Some of these extracts have even been said to stimulate blood flow to the scalp, which encourages hair growth. Be careful to dilute these extracts with a natural oil and do a patch test before applying to the scalp or hair.\n\nBeauty tip: You can purchase these herbal extracts as essential oils in your local health food store. Just add two to three drops of a herbal extract of your choice to your shampoo, conditioner or hair oil.\n\nREAD MORE | 4 ways to keep your hair smelling fresh all day\n\nIt's a natural humectant and conditioning agent derived from palm oil. Humectants attract and retain moisture in your hair and are usually used in shampoos and conditioners to increase their moisturising properties. Glycerin is most effective when there is moisture in the air to draw from. If used in the dry months, you may end up losing moisture in your hair instead.\n\nBeauty tip: Add a few drops of glycerin to your favourite leave-in conditioner in the warm and humid months in order to draw extra moisture to your hair.\n\nPro vitamin B is used in hair products to give sheen, replenish moisture and keep hair manageable. It's also known to build the hair's strength and thickness, making it more resistant to breakage and general damage. Beauty tip: You will most likely find panthenol in a shampoo and conditioner; just be sure the product is used as directed. 9.

Amid Hair Loss Awareness Month, Phil Day, the superintendent pharmacist at Pharmacy2U, shared how stress, nutrition, and fashion choices could be eroding your hair health.\n\nStarting off on a common mistake many people make, Day urged people to find their correct hat size. He explained: \"Wearing tight hats can pull on the hair causing 'traction alopecia' which is hair loss caused by constant pulling of the hair, causing tension and stress on the hair and its follicle leading to hair falling out.\"\n\nWearing looser headgear should rectify this hair loss if you've caught it early enough, according to the expert. Similarly, he also warned against tense hairstyles like top knots and ponytails. He advised: \"It's best to avoid hairstyles that pull on the hair too tightly, and if you are tying your hair up to tie it loosely.\"\n\nStress can also play a major factor in hair loss, and not just from pulling it out in the midst of a crisis, as Day pointed out research has proven the impact stress has on hair growth. He urged it may be time to \"seek help\" with your unmanageable stress if it's causing hair loss.\n\nThe expert encouraged people to manage their stress by ensuring they have enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, cut down on alcohol and smoking and exercise regularly. Nutrition in general was another one of Day's lifestyle choices impacting hair loss as he highlighted vitamins riboflavin, biotin, folate, and vitamin B12.\n\nDeficiencies in these vitamins, which can be found in eggs, leafy greens and meat, have a proven connection to hair loss. Using supplements can be an effective way to ensure you're getting all the ideal vitamins and Day particularly noted vegans specifically should look at vitamin B12, which is usually found in animal food and products.\n\nLastly, Day noted that hormone changes can majorly affect hair thinning, growth and loss. Although there are not many lifestyle changes that can shift these enough to negate the effects, the expert said: \"Women going through pregnancy or menopause, when their hormones are at different levels than usual, should especially look out for thinning hair or hair loss and seek help from a healthcare professional to discuss the best treatment.\"\n\nWith up to half of men and women experiencing genetic hair loss in their lifetime, preventing and stalling the loss of their locks has become a priority for many. While genetically induced follicle issues will start becoming visible in your 30s, or even earlier for some, the sooner people address it, the higher their chances of halting or reversing the damage.\n\nThe pharmacist added: \"Hair loss affects many people and can cause distress that affects a person's self-image. It's common to lose between 50 and 100 strands of hair a day, but if you're losing more hair than usual or noticing thinning then please speak to your GP who will be able to help.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_leathers@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Samantha Leathers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hair loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Day_(artist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Day (artist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_alopecia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traction alopecia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biotin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hair follicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leaf vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riboflavin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin B12"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Healthy diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-image"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children_and_Adolescents", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children and Adolescents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29693942.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Man-checking-his-hair-loss.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

According to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Brendan Camp, \"Gray hair may feel more coarse compared to pigmented hair because of less sebum or oil production.\" But there's hope. While natural oil production tapers off over time, the best oils for gray hair never stop delivering smoothing, shine-inducing, strength-restoring benefits. The trick? Finding a hair oil that delivers heavyweight anti-aging benefits, but is lightweight enough to keep gray hair looking vibrant, bouncy, and decidedly ungreasy. Ahead, hair stylists, dermatologists, and a trichologist share how to incorporate the best oils for gray hair into a weekly regime, plus the oils they most recommend for bringing a gleam back to silvery styles.\n\n\"To keep gray hair moisturized, I recommend using a hydrating shampoo and conditioner, deep conditioning weekly, and applying natural oils like argan oil,\" says New Jersey hairstylist Jennifer Korab. \"Avoid over-washing, use heat protectants, and choose sulfate-free products.\"\n\nDr. Candace Spann, a board-certified dermatologist in Las Vegas, also recommends steering clear of sulfates or fragrances when hair starts to gray. \"Shampoos that use harsh ingredients can lead to stripping of the hair and promote further dryness of gray hair,\" she says. Korab also advises getting regular trims, sticking to a balanced diet to maintain overall hair health, and using a humidifier in dry environments to help gray hair maintain moisture.\n\n\"Because gray hair tends to be dry or more coarse, it is often a bit frizzy as well,\" says Mara Roszak, the celebrity hairstylist behind R\u014dz Hair Care. \"It's important to choose a daily styling oil that will maintain the gorgeous gray color and not yellow the hair, smooth the hair, and protect the hair from heat styling without weighing it down.\" Some hair oils, like MoroccanOil Treatment Purple, contain ingredients that tone out brassiness in gray hair -- MoroccanOil's formulation, for example, is rich in violet pigments.\n\nSara Hallajian, a Santa Monica, California-based trichologist, reiterates the importance of finding a lightweight formulation. \"Not all oils are going to be suitable for the hair,\" she says. You want to look for an oil that will be lightweight enough to be absorbed by the hair cuticle to avoid making your hair look heavy and greasy.\"\n\nWhich oils in particular are lightweight enough for gray hair?

However, it's also hard to ignore the athletes who are not only at the top of their sport but also their hair game.\n\nFrom patriotic braids to unexpected mullets, the 2024 Paris Olympics is the ultimate lookbook of quirky, eye-catching hairstyles that may or may not enhance athletic performance but definitely grab the world's attention.\n\nMaybe it's because Paris is the fashion capital of the world, so competitors have decided to up the ante when it comes to style. Maybe it's because this new generation of international athletes have grown up with access to YouTube hair tutorials. Or maybe these superhuman talents have realized that, in a world where very few stars are genuine household names, making their look as memorable as their performance is a great way to stand out.\n\nThere's also the fact that when you grow up sporty, having fun with your hair might not be a priority, so the Olympics is a great opportunity for self-expression. You know that there are millions of eyes and cameras on you, so you might as well make an effort! It's just like your wedding day, only sweatier...\n\nWhatever the reasons, we're here for it. We've picked out a few of our favorite hair looks from the games so far:\n\nThere are strict rules in gymnastics about having your hair pinned back (nobody wants to get their ponytail tangled around a balance beam), but superstar Lee has found a way to stick to protocol while sprinkling in a little eye-catching detail -- a subtle but cute braided bun.\n\nRichardson, who picked up the silver medal for the women's 100 meters on Saturday, August 3, said that perfecting her hair and makeup for the track gave her a confidence boost. \"My lane is my catwalk,\" she recently told Vogue. \"We glam up! We put it on! When we step forward we're ready no matter what. Look good, feel good, do good. That all relates to the mental aspect, the emotional aspect and ultimately the physical.\"\n\nIt's not just the women who can have fun experimenting -- 100-meter men's gold medallist Lyles likes to mix it up too! It's good to know it's possible to stay speedy and streamlined while giving your hair a little extra pizzazz, right?\n\nThis has got to be one of our favorite looks of the games so far. How cool were Trinity Rodman's long, pink, very mermaid-y braids during the women's soccer games? The USWNT player added the rosy color just a couple weeks before the Olympics. She has styled her tresses into a flowing ponytail, woven the tiny braids into two french braids and even topped them with a beret when she arrived in France.\n\nSprinter Lansiquot is another athlete who takes pride in looking good on the track -- especially because her strict training schedule means she doesn't have much of a social life to dress up for. \"As someone who doesn't go out that much, I really enjoy doing a full face of makeup for race day, it's like having a big event to prep for,\" she told Grazia. \"I have a Pinterest board and I'll save eyeliner and hair looks that tie in the new season colors. It's a really fun way to add a different kind of excitement to preparation for the race, and it keeps my internal pressure low while externally I'm dialed into the season.\"\n\nHurdler Cockrell has experimented with a variety of different looks over the years, but for Paris she has cut her curls short -- and also says that doing her hair is an important part of her prep process. \"It's a time for me to be very intentional and be alone and listen to a podcast or listen to music and just be with myself and have a task versus laying in bed and being nervous,\" she told NBC. \"I feel a lot freer with my short hair. I like to go into a race feeling fresh.\"\n\nDescribed as \"the fastest mullet in the world,\" sprinter Hinchliffe has attracted almost as much attention for his hair as for his impressive running. The 22-year-old also rocks safety pin earrings, so we'd love to see more of his off-duty style.\n\n\"My favorite way to compete is wearing my hair in two buns,\" long jumper Sawyers told Grazia. \"I love this part of it; when I look good, I feel more confident, and confidence is half the battle in competition.\" It seems beauty is a crucial ingredient in many athletes' recipe for success.\n\nHow cute is Jefferson's big blue bow? The 23-year-old rocked the look when she won bronze in the 100-meter race.\n\nKomlanvi, a rower, is one of a number of athletes who've opted to nod to their country's flag colors -- and when your country's flag is yellow, red and green, it makes for a very fun and fresh look that stands out on the murky water.\n\nThis middle distance runner, who won gold for Team GB in the women's 800 meters on Monday (August 5), has one of those swishy, blonde ponytails that all the most athletic girls had in high school. \"My mantra on race day is 'look good, feel good,'\" she says. \"My beauty routine is all part of helping me get ready to compete and I love it! My blonde hair really stands out on the track and I love to race when my hair is long and curly. A hair wand and some gel are all it takes. The track is our stage to perform on and a chance to showcase our individuality.\"\n\nMany of the track and field events have been all about the braids, and high jumper Mahuchikh's were among the most stylish. Spending time on her hair has become a tradition for the athlete, another way to find focus and calm her pre-competition nerves. It clearly works; she got gold!\n\nTennis can be a pretty serious sport (just ask John McEnroe), but Coco Gauff added a subtle hint of playfulness and patriotism to the game with her stunning red, white and blue braids.\n\nAnother athlete who enthusiastically embraced the red, white and blue vibe, but sadly, Franklin's spectacular flying locks didn't give her the extra boost she needed to make it through to the triple jump finals.\n\nDutch basketball player de Jong loves to experiment with quirky styles -- he's previously rocked a leopard print dye job, but he opted for bleach and blue to stand out for his country at the Olympics.\n\nWe love that so many women playing male-dominated sports are showing once again that you can be a tough athlete who means business while still enjoying making your hair look cute too. Rugby Sevens star Sedrick's braided updo, topped with a patriotic scrunchie, is one of the prettiest looks of the games so far.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabel_mohan@usmagazine.com", "name": "Isabel Mohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Braid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponytail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ponytail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lookbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_(hairstyle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bun (hairstyle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Rodman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trinity Rodman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grazia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beret", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurdling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEnroe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McEnroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2163464319.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1674, "textEnd": 1682}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 4743, "textEnd": 4751}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

One of those brands is L'Or\u00e9al Paris Elvive. The high street range creates some of the best affordable hair care with quality that matches up to high-end products -- and there are so many products to choose from. Incidentally Senior Beauty Editor, Katie Thomas's favourite range is Hyaluron Plump, which she says hydrates whilst simultaneously brightening her blonde like one of the best purple shampoos. Executive Beauty Editor, Shannon Lawlor, loves the Hydra Pure Shampoo as it's the first one she's ever used that tackles both dry ends and greasy roots.\n\nBecause there is so much to choose from, it can get a little confusing to know what to try first, or what to add to your routine. In total there are over 10 different Elvive ranges, so to help you on your next shopping trip, I've broken down five of the best and spotlighted the best products from each.\n\n2024 has been the year of hair gloss and earlier this year L'Or\u00e9al Paris dropped its own range to help you achieve this look for a lot less. Glycolic Gloss uses, you guessed it, glycolic acid to add strength and shine to the hair.\n\nUsing an acid like glycolic isn't particularly new to the industry, other brands have done it previously with similar ingredients, however, this collection from L'Or\u00e9al is one of the best to have done it at a much more affordable price tag.\n\nIt's a close call but I think Dream Lengths is my favourite range out of them all. It's one of the few products that lives up to its name. I swear by it for keeping my lengths looking healthier for longer ahead of my next salon trip. It's not a replacement for getting your hair cut regularly but it absolutely keeps your ends looking better for longer and prevents hair looking frazzled.\n\nBond repair hair products are all about fixing those broken hair strands from chemical and bleach damage. This isn't a range you need to use if you consider your hair to be relatively healthy (for example, virgin hair (not dyed) without any chemical damage) so stick to hydrating products (more on that below) if you're not dealing with severely damaged hair. Now we've cleared that up, if you are in the 'my hair needs serious TLC' camp then this is a fantastic range that visibly improves damages hair -- at a fraction of the cost of others on the market.\n\nHydrating products like these are fantastic no matter your hair type. They're all-round brilliant products to use whether you want something reliable and hardworking to use regularly, or to use in between more targeted treatments. This range helps keep my hair clean and hydrated and there's not much more I could ask for on a day-to-day basis.\n\nColour your hair? You absolutely need some Colour Protect heroes in your routine. This helps preserve and even extend the life of your colour while it deeply cleanses so that you get a healthy scalp without compromising the colour you (or your colourist) no doubt worked hard to achieve.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tori_crowther@marieclaire.co.uk", "name": "Tori Crowther", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Or\u00e9al", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "L'Or\u00e9al"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hair care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glycolic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLC_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TLC (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salon (gathering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyling_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyling product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aB8E6gYaZsfCxikEKpg8Wk-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. Learn more!\n\nMuch like my personality, I want my hair to be big, bouncy and voluminous. The thing is, maintaining volume is a struggle with fine hair. Don't get me wrong, I love my hair, but anyone with this hair type knows the struggle: Your mane can look full and bouncy as soon as you style it, then an hour later it's already falling flat. In my experience, layering on volume-boosting products often makes things worse and weighs my hair down even more. What gives? From experience, it's best to go back to the basics and opt for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. More specifically, the Ouai Fine Hair Shampoo and Conditioner.\n\nI've tested out dozens of products designed to breathe life back into fine hair, yet none provide me with consistent, long-lasting results quite like this shampoo and conditioner. The secret is all in the ingredients, which pump up the volume immediately and over time. A combination of biotin, hydrolyzed keratin and chia seed oil create a powerful potion that enhances shine, combats dryness and amplifies bounce.\n\nBiotin and keratin are both naturally produced by our body and are considered the building blocks of hair, helping it to grow longer, thicker and stronger. As for chia seed oil, this fatty ingredient acts as a thickening agent to promote a fuller mane. A quick rinse and repeat with the shampoo and conditioner infuses hair with these nourishing ingredients without weighing it down.\n\nGet the Ouai Fine Hair Shampoo and Conditioner Set at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, August 6, 2024, but are subject to change.\n\nI rarely witness any major changes when I switch up my shampoo and conditioner, although the Ouai products are an exception. From the first use, I noticed that my roots appeared fuller, my hair beautifully cascaded down my back once dry and, most notably, I wasn't reaching for my volumizing texture spray on day two, three or four hair. As someone who usually styles my hair with some sort of volumizing foam to achieve the lift I'm after, the final look I achieved using nothing but the shampoo and conditioner was amazing.\n\nI'm not the only person who has fallen head over heels for this shampoo and conditioner, though. Almost 3,000 Amazon shoppers have experienced full, voluminous hair for the first time in their life, too. \"I have had thin hair my whole life. It's not like I expect it to change now that I'm 40. BUT! I think I have met my match for shampoo and conditioner,\" one happy customer writes. \"First off, these smell AMAZING!! Like, can I get the scent in a body spray?! But the real test was- will it make my hair feel thicker?! I have to say, I DO feel it is slightly thicker... but the kicker- my hair has grown an inch since using it! I kid you not! All I have to say is, I'm sold! If you have thin hair like me, I would most definitely give this one a try!\"\n\nI've never been one to repurchase shampoo and conditioner once I finish a set -- I usually just move on to the next.

Weaver quickly went over her hair with the dye and put it in a net so she wasn't left out.\n\nWeaver, from Las Vegas, told Newsweek that their hair-dyeing ritual was a great way to bond and be creative as a family.\n\n\"It's also great because it's not permanent, so it normally lasts about four to six weeks start to finish, and then their hair is their original color,\" she added.\n\n\"We plan to do it next summer,\" Weaver said.\n\nSome Instagram users were \"shocked\" by the mother-daughter ritual, with particular focus on the amount of time the product was left in the girls' hair.\n\nOne user commented that it was \"literally insane\" to leave hair dye on for three hours. Another said there was \"no way\" they would dye their daughter's hair at a young age.\n\nHowever, other social media users praised Weaver for giving her girls this experience.\n\nOne wrote: \"As a ginger, thank you for letting them dye their hair different colors and not tying their beauty to their hair their entire lives.

One skincare staple could be a total game-changer for battling greasy locks.\n\nWhen your mane requires a quick freshen-up but there's no time for a full wash, many of us instinctively grab the trusty can of dry shampoo. It's a lifesaver in those last-minute scenarios, injecting life back into our hairdos without the need for water. It's no substitute for the real deal when it comes to washing our tresses, but it absolutely does the job when you're in a bind.\n\nHowever, dry shampoo isn't without its pitfalls users often grapple with an unwelcome residue of white powder, which not only coats the hair but also accumulates on the scalp. So, despite the temporary fix, chances are you'll still have to wash your hair the following day.\n\nBut thanks to advice from one expert, you might be able to skip the powdery aftermath altogether.\n\nDr Adel took to her @aamnaadel TikTok page with a revelation that might just shake up your hair care routine: micellar water. Commonly viewed as a facial cleanser for removing makeup, the product can also work miracles on the roots of your hair in those greasy hair crises.\n\nThe dermatologist sang its praises, highlighting that micellar water is not only fantastic at cleansing skin but could be equally effective at tackling oily hair. She said: \"This might be the most genius hack that I have ever seen on TikTok. As a dermatologist who specialises in hair, let me tell you why I think micellar water for greasy hair is 100% worth trying.\"\n\n\"We all know and love micellar water for removing even the heaviest of makeup. The micelles in micellar water are literally like little magnets, they draw and suck up all of that dirt, sebum, sweat, and makeup, and basically remove it. Now, if you apply it to your hair, it will pretty much do exactly the same thing.\"\n\nMost people who try the hack spray the micellar water on their hair from a spray bottle and then blow dry it without rinsing it. While this is an option, Dr Adel recommends using some \"mattifying\" micellar water on a cotton pad to \"rub your scalp and your hair\".\n\nAdding further advice, she said: \"That way, you're actually going to remove all of that oil and dirt.\"\n\nThe beauty expert also conveyed that while this method is not a substitute for washing your hair, it serves as an excellent trick for a \"quick freshen up\" and is ideal for those wanting to avoid the \"white cast\" dry shampoo can leave behind. Dr Adel expressed her preference for the micellar water technique over \"starchy dry shampoos\", noting that water does not clog the hair follicles or cause build-up.\n\nThe response online was overwhelmingly positive with many quick to express their gratitude to the woman for sharing this innovative hair solution.

This condition, medically known as alopecia, can be triggered by various factors such as genetics, hormonal imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and certain medical conditions. The impact of hair loss on an individual's self-esteem and overall psychological well-being cannot be overstated, often leading to a search for effective treatment solutions. The market for hair loss treatment products has expanded significantly over the years, offering a plethora of options ranging from over-the-counter treatments to prescription medications and natural remedies.\n\nOne of the most well-known hair loss treatment products is Minoxidil, commonly available under brand names such as Rogaine. Initially developed as a treatment for high blood pressure, Minoxidil was found to have the beneficial side effect of promoting hair growth. It is applied topically and is suitable for both men and women, often recommended for androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss. Minoxidil works by prolonging the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, thereby increasing the chances of hair regrowth. Its ease of application and availability without a prescription have made it a popular choice among those seeking to combat hair loss.\n\nBeyond pharmaceutical treatments, the market is also flooded with a variety of hair loss shampoos, conditioners, and serums that claim to stimulate hair growth and strengthen existing hair. These products often contain ingredients such as biotin, keratin, caffeine, and essential oils, which are believed to nourish the scalp and improve hair health. While the efficacy of these products can vary, they are generally considered to be safe and can complement other treatment methods.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in natural and holistic approaches to hair loss treatment. Essential oils such as rosemary, peppermint, and lavender have been studied for their potential to promote hair growth, and dietary supplements containing vitamins and minerals like zinc, iron, and vitamin D are often recommended to address nutritional deficiencies that can contribute to hair loss. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as stress management techniques and dietary changes can play a crucial role in maintaining healthy hair.\n\nThe landscape of hair loss treatment products is vast and continually evolving, offering a wide range of options to suit different needs and preferences. From well-established pharmaceutical treatments like Minoxidil and Finasteride to natural remedies and cutting-edge technologies, individuals experiencing hair loss have numerous avenues to explore.\n\nAs per the latest research done by Verified Market Research experts, the Global Hair Loss Treatment Products Market shows that the market will be growing at a faster pace.

If you buy something through our links, we may earn commission. Read more about our Product Review Guidelines here.\n\nMarsha Brady, and maybe your grandma, famously brushed her hair 100 times a day. It's an old adage that claims to increase shine and promote hair growth that, at face value, has been ruled as myth by the internet (and plenty of dermatologists). But like most things in beauty, there's plenty of nuance to consider.\n\nDo the 100-stroke method's claims hold any merit? It's worth exploring, especially now that we're in an era of reconnecting with time-honored beauty rituals, many of which revolve around hair. Turns out, the answer isn't as cut-and-dry as we thought it would be. There are caveats, conditions, tools, and techniques that surround brushing your hair 100 times in a row. Some experts claim that it's a valid way to keep hair healthy and shiny (when performed correctly), while others say it's not worth the risk of damage.\n\nTo learn more about the method and discover whether or not it's worth the time in your beauty routine, we sought intel from both sides of the spectrum: a sixth generation French luxury brushmaker and a trichologist specializing in scalp health. Keep scrolling for their takes and everything you need to know about the 100-stroke hair method.\n\nHelen Reavey is a celebrity hairstylist, trichologist, and founder of hair care brand Act + Acre.\n\nJulia Tissot-Gaillard is the CEO of French brushmakers Altesse Studio and Fournival Altesse.\n\nIn a nutshell, the 100-stroke method is a system for gently brushing your hair from root to ends in four sections, with 25 strokes per section. \"This method allows you to massage the whole scalp and stimulate blood circulation, as well as grasp the natural oils present on your scalp and distribute it along the length of hair to deliver nourishment, protection, and shine,\" Julia Tissot-Gaillard, brushmaker and CEO of Altesse Studio, tells PS.\n\nIt should be noted that this is best performed on dry, fully detangled hair and with a high quality boar bristle brush. As Tissot-Gaillard explains, \"Boar bristles are the only fiber with cuticles that mimic the scalp, so only select a 100 percent boar brush (not a nylon-boar hybrid) with bristles that are rigid and poke your fingers. If they are soft and flexible, they are low quality bristles and won't penetrate through the hair.\"\n\nTissot-Gaillard helms the long standing brushmaker brand Altesse, who have been crafting boar bristle brushes since 1875. And it's luxury brushes like theirs -- notably the Prestige Repair & Shine Brush -- that allow users to thoroughly brush with minimal damage. They can get pricey, but one PS editor's glowing review of a similar high-end boar brush proves they can be a worthy investment.\n\nWhile there is no argument that brushing your hair can benefit your scalp and your overall mood (obviously brushing feels amazing), experts believe it can be a double-edged sword. \"Brushing has both positive and negative impacts on hair health,\" trichologist and hairstylist Helen Reavey says. \"It helps distribute natural oils, which adds shine and conditions the hair, but excessive brushing can damage the hair, especially if it's fragile and prone to breakage.\"\n\nLuckily, there are ways to get around the intensive 100-stroke method and still reap its reported benefits.\n\nWhen looking for ways to increase overall hair health, it's often best to start at the scalp. \"You can accomplish the same [effects] with fewer strokes by adding scalp massages to your routine,\" says Reavey, who is a strong proponent of boosting scalp microbiome health with this technique, especially when paired with topical products that strengthen the hair follicle. She recommends using the Act + Acre 3% Stem Cell Peptide Treatment ($120) daily, which contains caffeine, plant stem cells, peptides to help stimulate scalp blood flow.\n\nStill partial to the idea of a brushing ritual but don't want to risk the breakage? Tissot-Gaillard suggests opting for an abridged version with 10 to 15 strokes per section and using a soft bristled boar brush -- like the Classic Repair & Shine Brush ($320), which is designed for fine to medium hair.\n\nHowever, if you are noticing excess hair loss, scalp damage, or irritation, always consult with your dermatologist before diving into any new hair-care routine.", "source": {"uri": "popsugar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POPSUGAR UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_cassidy@popsugar.com", "name": "Hannah Cassidy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trichology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild boar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hair care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuticle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuticle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hair loss"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Ear_Candling", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Ear Candling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/L12vPsmkTkM-eufIBxBR3Yre4Pg=/0x2087:3386x3780/fit-in/3400x5132/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2024/08/06/779/n/1922153/134b4edf66b2609dbea367.76701239_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The spray helps to breathe new life into your hair, and while it's not a replacement for actually shampooing your locks, it will do in a pinch.\n\nDry shampoo comes with its downsides. however, as it can leave your hair coated in a white powder which can build up on your scalp, meaning you'll almost certainly need to shampoo it the next day anyway. But according to one dermatologist, there's another product you can use to freshen up your hair without the horrible buildup.\n\nDr Adel shared a video on her @aamnaadel account on TikTok in which she explained that you can actually use micellar water on your roots to revive greasy hair in an emergency. Micellar water is traditionally used as a skincare product to remove makeup, but the dermatologist said it works wonders on your hair too for the same reasons that it's good at cleaning your face.\n\nShe explained: \"This might be the most genius hack that I have ever seen on TikTok. As a dermatologist who specialises in hair, let me tell you why I think micellar water for greasy hair is 100% worth trying.\n\n\"We all know and love micellar water for removing even the heaviest of makeup. The micelles in micellar water are literally like little magnets, they draw and suck up all of that dirt, sebum, sweat, and makeup, and basically remove it. Now, if you apply it to your hair, it will pretty much do exactly the same thing.\"\n\nMost people who try the hack spray the micellar water on their hair from a spray bottle and then blow dry it without rinsing it. While this works, Dr Adel would recommend pouring some \"mattifying\" micellar water onto a cotton pad and using it to \"rub your scalp and your hair\".\n\nShe added: \"That way, you're actually going to remove all of that oil and dirt.\" The expert also stated this method \"does not beat washing your hair\", but is the perfect trick for a \"quick freshen up\", especially if you're not a fan of the \"white cast\" that dry shampoo can leave. In fact, Dr Adel said she prefers the micellar water method to \"starchy dry shampoos\" because the water won't clog your hair follicles or cause product buildup.\n\nCommenters on the post were quick to thank the woman for her hair hack, as many said they couldn't wait to try it out for themselves as an alternative to dry shampoo.\n\nOne person said: \"I hope this works for me. Dry shampoo makes my scalp sore and gives me ingrown hairs on my head.\" And another added: \"I've been doing this for years on 4c hair. With the cotton pad method. It works.\"", "source": {"uri": "gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gloucestershire Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zahna_eklund@gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "name": "Zahna Eklund", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Micelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dry shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sebaceous gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hair follicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i2-prod.leicestermercury.co.uk/incoming/article7045273.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-673437152-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Across two weeks I rubbed a red onion on my scalp every other day.\n\nAs onion juice isn't sold in cartons and I didn't want to make my smoothie maker have a lingering reek, I cut my onions in half and rubbed it directly onto the more patchy areas around my temples.\n\nThe internet is also lacking resources about how long to do this for - or any other information about how long the DIY hair booster is supposed to marinate on your scalp.\n\nI followed the guide available on Times of India, which advised beauty buffs to massage the scalp for a few minutes before letting the stinky juice work its magic for half-an-hour.\n\nThis is where I encountered the first major problem - my eyes, perhaps too sensitive for this project, were tearing up and the unpleasant sensation wasn't going away despite my efforts to rinse it all out.\n\nHowever, it all took a turn for the worst as then the skin around my temples - which becomes thinner as you age - felt as if it had been set alight.\n\nI then gave my scalp a little massage and resorted to my bedroom for the recommended 30 minutes before dashing to the shower to desperately get rid of the pungent aroma.\n\nMy typical hair wash routine consists of a quick shampoo session and a generous amount of conditioner to treat my bleached tresses - however, the stinky juice left me paranoid.\n\nNot particularly keen on the idea of walking around smelling like chopped onions, I shampooed my hair twice every time that I'd applied the veggie to my scalp.\n\nLuckily, it seemed that this worked a charm, as throughout the two weeks that I was following this routine - every other day - I didn't have any complaints or people running away from me on the Tube.\n\nOne thing worth noting is that whilst my blonde locks weren't smelling - or at least, no one gave me weird looks - my fingers were, making me reach for soap and a scented hand cream more than I'm used to.\n\nBut now for the final question - did it work? Is my hair back to its former thicker self? Are the slick back bun-induced patches gone?\n\nAlthough I can see a little difference - and even a few new baby hairs peeking through - it's difficult to tell whether that's because of the 10p hack and even celebrity hairstylist Jason Collier agrees.\n\nThe beauty guru, who's styled the tresses of big celebs, such as the former Love Island host Laura Whitmore, said he couldn't see how such a ''gimmick'' could work.\n\nThe overall verdict - while my locks weren't reeking and there was some hair growth, I feel as if that's the result of the scalp massage rather than the pungent root vegetable.\n\nNote: If you're keen to give this homemade remedy a go, you may want to test a small area of your scalp first to ensure you're not allergic to onion juice. It's also advised to follow this routine with a scented shampoo and a conditioner.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_kulniece@the-sun.com", "name": "Kate Kulniece", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hair loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapunzel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapunzel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Collagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trichotillomania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_alopecia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traction alopecia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoothie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Collier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Collier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Whitmore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Whitmore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/08/SC_FAB-HAIR-HACK_OP_f0293b.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It's a lifesaver for injecting life back into your mane, and although it's no substitute for a proper wash, it's a handy stopgap.\n\nHowever, dry shampoo isn't without its drawbacks; it can leave a white powdery residue that builds up on the scalp, often necessitating a proper wash sooner rather than later. But one skin expert has suggested an alternative that could refresh your hair without the unwanted residue.\n\nIn a TikTok video posted by Dr Adel on her @aamnaadel account, she reveals that micellar water, typically used to remove makeup, can also work miracles on greasy hair. The dermatologist advocates for its use on hair roots in a pinch due to its effective cleansing properties.\n\nDr Adel elaborates: \"This might be the most genius hack that I have ever seen on TikTok. As a dermatologist who specialises in hair, let me tell you why I think micellar water for greasy hair is 100% worth trying.\n\n\"We all know and love micellar water for removing even the heaviest of makeup. The micelles in micellar water are literally like little magnets, they draw and suck up all of that dirt, sebum, sweat, and makeup, and basically remove it. Now, if you apply it to your hair, it will pretty much do exactly the same thing.\"\n\nMost people who give the hack a go tend to spray the micellar water onto their locks from a spray bottle and then simply blow-dry without rinsing. While effective, Dr Adel suggests tipping some \"mattifying\" micellar water onto a cotton pad and using it to \"rub your scalp and your hair\". She further noted: \"That way, you're actually going to remove all of that oil and dirt.\"\n\nThe expert also mentioned that while this method \"does not beat washing your hair\", it's an ace trick for a \"quick freshen up\", particularly if you're not keen on the \"white cast\" left by dry shampoo. In fact, Dr Adel expressed a preference for the micellar water technique over \"starchy dry shampoos\" as it doesn't block your hair follicles or lead to product buildup.\n\nThe post's commenters were swift to express their gratitude for the nifty hair tip, with many eager to test it out as a substitute for dry shampoo. One individual commented: \"I hope this works for me. Dry shampoo makes my scalp sore and gives me ingrown hairs on my head.\" Another shared: \"I've been doing this for years on 4c hair. With the cotton pad method. It works.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zahna_eklund@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Zahna Eklund", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Micelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amino acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sebaceous gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dry shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hair follicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33411637.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Young-annoyed-woman-is-upset-about-dirty-oily-and-greasy-hair-looking-in-mirror-at-home-Health-trea.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Even more, it leaves just a few marks on your hair.\"\n\nIt adds: \"No pressure on the temples, no tension headaches and irritation of the scalp. The stylish hair accessory is a real eye-catcher for any time.\"\n\nFollowing Kayleigh's revelation, many users chimed in with their opinions. Liza commented: \"They are so nice\", reports the Mirror. Bec remarked: \"These look cool.\" Catherine simply said: \"Pretty.\"\n\nAside from Home Bargains, these hair accessories are also available at Boots and Amazon, priced between \u00a38-\u00a315. But choosing the Home Bargains option could result in significant savings.\n\nOn Amazon, one shopper left a review of Invisibobble'sTrue Dark Sparkle headband, which reads: \"Game changer for me! I can never wear a hairband for more than half an hour without pain. It's really comfortable to wear and looks stylish. It holds my hair back well all day, although I can see it may not hold back very thick or very fine hair. Luckily for me it works great on my hair type.\"\n\nAnother user enthused: \"I have thick hair and using this hair band stops me having to clip it back or use a hair bobble. It is the only one that has kept my hair in place without hurting my head. It doesn't dig in and doesn't cause me headaches.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_smith@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Bargains", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home Bargains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boots (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29693565.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gettyimages-1395182013.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.\n\nPEOPLE experience hair loss and thinning for a plethora of reasons, from genetics and ageing to tight hair styles and over-colouring.\n\nNow I'm approaching my thirties (I'm 28) I've begun to notice I'm getting a slight receding hairline - all because I've fallen victim to the so-called ''clean girl aesthetic'' which is known for the viral slick-back bun.\n\nDespite repeated warnings by experts who say that this trendy hairstyle ''can cause traction alopecia - a form of hair loss caused by repeated hair pulling'' - it's my go-to on days when I'm not washing my bleached tresses.\n\nThe tight hairdo may be perfect for my gym sessions - but are there any ways to reverse the balding patches and make the thin hair as thick as it once was?\n\nLike many cash-strapped Brits, my bank balance has seen better days and I'm always on the lookout for cost-effective alternatives to high-street products.\n\nOne of them, I found out this year, is... the humble onion - which even ''real-life Rapunzel'' Smita Srivastava swears is what's given her the longest tresses in the world, measuring at a whopping 7ft 9in.\n\nUsed for centuries, especially around India, this purse-friendly kitchen staple contains sulphur, which can help promote collagen production.\n\nCollagen in turn helps the production of healthy skin cells and hair growth, the experts at Healthline say.\n\nAnother reason the 10p supermarket find is said to be like a miracle for long tresses is that it helps boost blood circulation to your scalp.\n\nBut as there have been very few studies - with one over two decades old - does incorporating the smelly root veggie in your haircare routine really work?\n\nI decided to see for myself. Across two weeks I rubbed a red onion on my scalp every other day.\n\nAs onion juice isn't sold in cartons and I didn't want to make my smoothie maker have a lingering reek, I cut my onions in half and rubbed it directly onto the more patchy areas around my temples.\n\nThe internet is also lacking resources about how long to do this for - or any other information about how long the DIY hair booster is supposed to marinate on your scalp.\n\nI followed the guide available on Times of India, which advised beauty buffs to massage the scalp for a few minutes before letting the stinky juice work its magic for half-an-hour.\n\nThis is where I encountered the first major problem - my eyes, perhaps too sensitive for this project, were tearing up and the unpleasant sensation wasn't going away despite my efforts to rinse it all out.\n\nHowever, it all took a turn for the worst as then the skin around my temples - which becomes thinner as you age - felt as if it had been set alight.\n\nI then gave my scalp a little massage and resorted to my bedroom for the recommended 30 minutes before dashing to the shower to desperately get rid of the pungent aroma.\n\nMy typical hair wash routine consists of a quick shampoo session and a generous amount of conditioner to treat my bleached tresses - however, the stinky juice left me paranoid.\n\nNot particularly keen on the idea of walking around smelling like chopped onions, I shampooed my hair twice every time that I'd applied the veggie to my scalp.\n\nLuckily, it seemed that this worked a charm, as throughout the two weeks that I was following this routine - every other day - I didn't have any complaints or people running away from me on the Tube.\n\nOne thing worth noting is that whilst my blonde locks weren't smelling - or at least, no one gave me weird looks - my fingers were, making me reach for soap and a scented hand cream more than I'm used to.\n\nBut now for the final question - did it work? Is my hair back to its former thicker self? Are the slick back bun-induced patches gone?\n\nAlthough I can see a little difference - and even a few new baby hairs peeking through - it's difficult to tell whether that's because of the 10p hack and even celebrity hairstylist Jason Collier agrees.\n\nThe beauty guru, who's styled the tresses of big celebs, such as the former Love Island host Laura Whitmore, said he couldn't see how such a ''gimmick'' could work.\n\nThe overall verdict - while my locks weren't reeking and there was some hair growth, I feel as if that's the result of the scalp massage rather than the pungent root vegetable.\n\nNote: If you're keen to give this homemade remedy a go, you may want to test a small area of your scalp first to ensure you're not allergic to onion juice. It's also advised to follow this routine with a scented shampoo and a conditioner.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_kulniece@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Kate Kulniece", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hair loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scalp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Collagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trichotillomania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_alopecia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traction alopecia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapunzel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapunzel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoothie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sulfur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Collier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Collier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Whitmore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Whitmore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/SC_FAB-HAIR-HACK_OP_f0293b.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Kayleigh shared her amazing find on Facebook, leaving other bargain hunters in awe.\n\nOn popular group, Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK, she wrote: \"99p each in Home Bargains. RRP at \u00a310.95 each!\" Underneath the caption, she uploaded a photo of three Invisibobble Hair Halos.\n\nInvisibobble's Hair Halos are 'uniquely designed' headbands that prioritise comfort, ensuring you can 'wear them all day without any headaches'. On the official website, the majority of hairbands are priced around \u00a311, costing \u00a315 if you were to buy one at Next.\n\nREAD MORE: Sainsbury's \u00a34 loafers look perfect with jeans and dresses and 'always get compliments'\n\nREAD MORE: Sainsbury's 'perfect for autumn' \u00a319 quilted jacket could easily be mistaken for \u00a3140 Barbour\n\n\"Try the headband on, adjust it where it is too tight or too loose by bending it and then wear it comfortably all day long. Even more, it leaves just a few marks on your hair,\" a statement online reads.\n\nIt contiues: \"No pressure on the temples, no tension headaches and irritation of the scalp. The stylish hair accessory is a real eye-catcher for any time.\"\n\nAfter Kayleigh shared her bargain find, a lot of users joined the conversation with their thoughts. Liza commented: \"They are so nice\", reports the Mirror. Bec added: \"These look cool.\" Catherine simply put: \"Pretty.\"\n\nIn addition to Home Bargains, you can find these hair accessories at Boots, Next and Amazon, with prices ranging from \u00a38 to \u00a315. However, opting for Home Bargains can lead to some great savings.\n\nOn Amazon, one shopper left a review of Invisibobble's True Dark Sparkle headband. \"Game changer for me!\" They said. \"I can never wear a hairband for more than half an hour without pain. It's really comfortable to wear and looks stylish. It holds my hair back well all day, although I can see it may not hold back very thick or very fine hair. Luckily for me it works great on my hair type.\"\n\nAnother user penned: \"I have thick hair and using this hair band stops me having to clip it back or use a hair bobble.

On popular Facebook group, Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK, a member called Kayleigh left many others impressed with her bargain find.\n\n\"99p each in Home Bargains. RRP at \u00a310.95 each!\" She wrote in a post, which has garnered hundreds of likes and plenty of comments. Her post includes a picture of three Invisibobble Hair Halos.\n\nInvisibobble's Hair Halos are headbands that have been designed to 'not hurt your head' or 'give you a headache'. On Invisibobble's official website, most of the hairbands cost around \u00a311, depending which one you buy.\n\nA statement on the website reads: \"Try the headband on, adjust it where it is too tight or too loose by bending it and then wear it comfortably all day long. Even more, it leaves just a few marks on your hair.\"\n\nIn response to Kayleigh's post, many were quick to share their thoughts in the comment section. Liza wrote: \"They are so nice.\" Bec said: \"These look cool.\"\n\nCatherine added: \"Pretty.\" However Amy claimed: \"They hurt your head. It's like the wire is bent incorrectly...don't bother.\"\n\nYou can also buy the hair accessories at Boots and Amazon, from between \u00a38-\u00a315. So opting for the ones available at Home Bargains can save you plenty of money.\n\nOn Amazon, one review of Invisibobble's True Dark Sparkle headband reads: \"Game changer for me! I can never wear a hairband for more than half an hour without pain. It's really comfortable to wear and looks stylish. It holds my hair back well all day, although I can see it may not hold back very thick or very fine hair. Luckily for me it works great on my hair type.\"\n\nAnother says: \"I have thick hair and using this hair band stops me having to clip it back or use a hair bobble. It is the only one that has kept my hair in place without hurting my head. It doesn't dig in and doesn't cause me headaches.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_smith@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Bargains", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home Bargains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Couponing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme Couponing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boots (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33413130.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2157091711.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795560", "eventUri": "eng-9795560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, released a video this week reacting to a number of such clips, expressing outrage at the nuisance creators and facetiously branding them \u201cterrorists\u201d. Kjellberg claimed these YouTubers were acting as \u201cobnoxious as possible [to] get a bunch of attention, get a bunch of hate clicks\u201d, and that this growing trend had become an \u201cinfestation\u201d. \u201cYouTubers, they\u2019re the worst,\u201d he said in the video, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times. \u201cYouTubers ruin everything, and right now YouTubers are ruining Japan \u2026 and now it\u2019s come so far that Japan is actually starting to take action.\u201d The Swede, who was for many years the most subscribed creator on YouTube with 111 million followers, rose to fame streaming video games before semi-retiring in 2022, when he moved to Japan to live with his wife Marzia. Kjellberg highlighted multiple videos of streamers trying to create viral content and publicity by being a nuisance in the conservative country, such as refusing to pay a bus fee and a train ticket. He also reacted to another infamous streamer, Johnny Somali, who sparked outrage in Japan last year after filming himself harassing people in public and in the subway, as well as trespassing in a construction zone and repeating \u201cFukushima\u201d when he was caught and told to leave. The Somali-American streamer, whose real name is Ramsey Khalid Ismael, was eventually arrested and fined 200,000 yen ($1930) before leaving the country. Kjellberg was open with his disapproval, slamming Ismael as \u201csuch an idiot\u201d. He also had a message for anyone trying to replicate this behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to grow your channel, you\u2019re just going to make everyone hate you and you\u2019ll regret it. Don\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d Ismael later fired back, threatening to sue the multi-millionaire creator and calling him a \u201chypocrite\u201d and a \u201cracist\u201d. \u201cRacist against blacks, and a anti-Semite! This hypocrite has no room to even discuss me, especially with misinformation and lies!\u201d he wrote on X, referencing Kjellberg\u2019s past controversies. In 2017, Kjellberg was criticised for saying a racist slur while livestreaming. Ismael followed up by saying, \u201cHe called me a \u2018terrorist\u2019. Very interesting use of language that could be racially motivated. Definitely defamatory, and considered slander, and libel. See you in court FELIX.\u201d It comes as Japan increasingly cracks down on disruptive behaviour from tourists. Earlier this month, a Japanese town mounted a large 2.5-metre by 20-metre mesh barrier at a popular viewing spot for Mount Fuji, in an attempt to deter photo-taking by an ever-growing number of tourists. Japan\u2019s most famous sight can be seen for miles around, but Fujikawaguchiko locals were fed up with streams of mostly foreign visitors littering, trespassing and breaking traffic rules in their hunt for a photo to share on social media. Parking illegally and ignoring a smoking ban, they would cram a pavement to shoot the snow-capped mountain, which soars photogenically into the sky from behind a convenience store, residents said. And in April, a new tourist ban was established in a popular district of Kyoto. Tourists are now barred from entering certain alleys in Gion, the famous district where geisha work in teahouses, with Aussie travelers warned to take note. Local residents had become fed-up with hordes of tourists, saying their neighborhood \u201cis not a theme park\u201d, pleading with the city to take action. Reported incidents of unruly tourists included a maiko\u2019s kimono being torn and another having cigarette butt put in her collar. A maiko is an apprentice geisha. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this, but we\u2019re desperate,\u201d said Isokazu Ota, an executive member of a Gion residents\u2019 council, comparing tourists who crowd around geisha emerging from the narrow alleys to \u201cpaparazzi\u201d. One video shared on Reddit showed a female tourist aggressively running up to a geisha as she walked down a street to take photos, obstructing her path and forcing to her to go around. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with that idiot? How can anyone not understand how absolutely wrong that is? That level of stupidity is beyond measure!\u201d one commenter said. \u201cPeople think real places are similar to Disneyland,\u201d wrote another. More than 25 million international travellers visited Japan in 2023, according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation (JNTO), after the country\u2019s borders reopened to tourists following Covid. Japan has grown in popularity among Aussie travellers, rivalling Bali in some industry rankings, helped by the gradually increasing strength of the Australian dollar against the Japanese yen.", "summary": "\u201cYouTubers, they\u2019re the worst,\u201d he said in the video, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/lifestyle/youtube-star-pewdiepie-says-terrorist-streamers-ruined-japan/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/82732688.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Yg5c8sUP-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:26:25", "author": "News.com.au", "authors": ["News.com.au"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.271}

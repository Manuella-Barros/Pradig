China's Australian Open runner-up and seventh seed Zheng Qinwen won the match 6-1, 6-1 to reach the 2nd round of the French Open on May 28, Tuesday. She sent the Frenchwoman into retirement with this loss at her home Grand Slam. Cornet made her Roland Garros debut in 2005 at the age of 15 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the US Open in 2006.\n\nThe 34-year-old Cornet had earlier announced that she would bid adieu to tennis after the tournament. However, Cornet will still compete in the women's doubles and mixed doubles events before she brings the curtain down on her celebrated career of 20 years.\n\nDuring the post-match press conference, Cornet admitted that she was already quite emotional about Rafael Nadal's early exit from Roland Garros on May 27, Monday, and now she is even more tear-eyed.\n\n\"I was already in tears after Rafael Nadal's match (on Monday).

I was just really lucky to have the life I've had. It took a lot of efforts and sacrifices and questioning yourself. There were lot of ups and downs. But what an adventure.\"\n\nIt was a rainy day in Paris and the Frenchwoman gave it all under the Court Philppe Chartrier roof.

Zheng, however, was in no mood to become the 26th. The Australian Open finalist dealt with the occasion coolly to end Cornet's career 6-2, 6-1 in 1 hour and 23 minutes.\n\nFanfares from the Philippe-Chatrier stands greeted Cornet's last dance before even the first point had been played, but it was Zheng who controlled the tempo of the match throughout. The 21-year-old tallied 25 winners to 19 unforced errors, successfully using her raw power to keep Cornet at bay.\n\nThe Frenchwoman roused local hopes briefly in the first set as she pulled back from 4-0 down to 4-2, and was able to show of her array of defensive spins and angles as she dragged Zheng into some excellent exchanges.\n\nHowever, it was more often than not Zheng who came out on top of them -- she won 10 of the 15 rallies of nine shots or more -- frequently ending lung-busting points with delicate drop shots. Even some of the luck seemed to be on her side. As Zheng held a point to lead 3-1 in the second set, Cornet pulled off a superb half-volley that spun away from her opponent. Zheng, though, hared across the court to reach it, and found a backhand pass that clipped the net cord and bounced out of Cornet's reach.\n\nFanfares and chants to the tune of Seven Nation Army rang out again in the final game as Cornet boldly fended off the first three match points she faced. Appropriately, it took something special from Zheng to finally put the indefatigable 34-year-old away -- a beautifully angled forehand volley that cut of Cornet's attempted pass.\n\nWith that, the curtain was brought down on Cornet's career, which ended with her record 69th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, and something of a full circle moment. Cornet had started her her Hologic WTA Tour career as a 15-year-old wild card at Roland Garros 2005, where she reached the second round before falling to the No.3 seed that year, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo.\n\nNow the Roland Garros tournament director, Mauresmo was there again.

When faced with her opponent's strength and pressure, the Nicoise did what she does best--fight. She managed to achieve a double break, soon pulling away from the score. She was able to bounce back from a 4-0 deficit to a 4-2 one thanks to her excellent defence.\n\nAfterwards, reflecting on her legacy in the sport and her popularity with both fans and fellow players, Cornet said she wanted to be \"remembered as a genuine player.\"\n\n\"I'd like to be remembered as a genuine player who shared all her emotions with everyone all throughout her career with a fighting spirit. Someone who is a passionate tennis player, who likes to fight and who could die for it. I think I showed it several times, that it was actually my type of character. People may love me or not for that type of personality, actually, but this is what brought me here,\" Cornet said as quoted by WTA.\n\nBefore the first point was played, Cornet's final dance was met with cheers from the Philippe-Chatrier stands, but Zheng was the one setting the pace for the whole game. The 21-year-old effectively used her natural strength to hold Cornet at bay, tallying 25 victories to only 19 unintentional mistakes.\n\nIn the opening set, the Frenchwoman gave locals a small boost of confidence when she rallied from a 4-0 deficit to a 4-2. She also demonstrated her variety of defensive spins and angles by drawing Zheng into some superb exchanges.\n\n\"I was selected to take the balls during this tournament, and Amelie was playing there. There was Venus Williams, Patty Schnyder, Justine Henin. It was wonderful. It was a first experience where I was close to the players,\" she added.\n\n\"And when I think about it, when I think back now, Amelie Mauresmo is handing me the end-of-career trophy, and she's been there all the time. I think about all the journey behind me. Often we just don't go back in time. We don't think about what's happened. I will have time to do so in the weeks to come, and some nostalgia comes in as well,\" the Frenchwoman said.\n\nIn the decisive game, cheers and shouts to the tune of Seven Nation Army erupted once more as Cornet valiantly repelled the first three match points she encountered. The 34-year-old Zheng eventually put an end to Cornet's relentless play, and it required a brilliant angled forehand volley from him to cut off Cornet's attempted pass.\n\nThat marked the conclusion of Cornet's career, which culminated in a momentous occasion marking her 69th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance. At Roland Garros in 2005, Cornet began her career on the Hologic WTA Tour as a 15-year-old wild card. She advanced to the second round but was defeated by Amelie Mauresmo, the No. 3 seed, in that match.

I couldn't dream of anything better,\" she said.\n\n\"And to this 15-year-old: you didn't do too badly, kid.\"\n\nThe thirtysomething version of Cornet started the farewell abysmally. Zheng raced into a 4-0 lead before Cornet clawed her way back. But after squandering several chances to win a third successive game, Cornet succumbed anew.\n\nThe 21-year-old claimed the opener 6-2 and after both players held serve at the start of the second set, Zheng raced away to take it 6-1.\n\n\"Congratulations on a wonderful career,\" said Zheng after her 83-minute victory. \"We won't forget you. I hope you have a great life after tennis. Be happy.\"\n\nAs a 15-year-old Cornet was given an invitation by the French tennis federation to play in the main draw at the French Open in 2005.

Zheng, however, was in no mood to become the 26th. The Australian Open finalist dealt with the occasion coolly to end Cornet's career 6-2, 6-1 in 1 hour and 23 minutes.\n\nFanfares from the Philippe-Chatrier stands greeted Cornet's last dance before even the first point had been played, but it was Zheng who controlled the tempo of the match throughout. The 21-year-old tallied 25 winners to 19 unforced errors, successfully using her raw power to keep Cornet at bay.\n\nThe Frenchwoman roused local hopes briefly in the first set as she pulled back from 4-0 down to 4-2, and was able to show of her array of defensive spins and angles as she dragged Zheng into some excellent exchanges.\n\nHowever, it was more often than not Zheng who came out on top of them -- she won 10 of the 15 rallies of nine shots or more -- frequently ending lung-busting points with delicate drop shots. Even some of the luck seemed to be on her side. As Zheng held a point to lead 3-1 in the second set, Cornet pulled off a superb half-volley that spun away from her opponent. Zheng, though, hared across the court to reach it, and found a backhand pass that clipped the net cord and bounced out of Cornet's reach.\n\nFanfares and chants to the tune of Seven Nation Army rang out again in the final game as Cornet boldly fended off the first three match points she faced. Appropriately, it took something special from Zheng to finally put the indefatigable 34-year-old away -- a beautifully angled forehand volley that cut of Cornet's attempted pass.", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliz\u00e9_Cornet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliz\u00e9 Cornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tempo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Nation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seven Nation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Tractor_and_Truck_Pulling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Tractor and Truck Pulling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/05/28/c1fafd1e-c248-48e8-9b10-e3b83cfbe9b2/Zheng-R1-ANNE-CHRISTINE-POUJOULAT-AFP-via-Getty-Image.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604399", "eventUri": "eng-9604399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

She dominated the match, breaking Cornet early in the second set and swiftly building a 5-1 lead before closing out the match in style.\n\nAfter the match, Zheng shared a heartfelt hug with Cornet at the net, as the small crowd at the main stadium rose to their feet to applaud the local favorite.

AP\n\nFrenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended on Tuesday after her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance at the French Open, the tournament where she made her debut aged 15 and was once a ball girl.\n\nCornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng Qinwen on Court Philippe Chatrier in the first round, losing 6-2, 6-1.\n\nShe made her debut at Roland Garros in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.\n\nThe 34-year-old's run of consecutive appearances at the majors smashed the previous women's record of 62 set by Japan's Ai Sugiyama.\n\n\"Emotionally it was not easy,\" said Cornet on her decision to retire after a 20-year professional career.\n\n\"Some days I was really excited about retirement and some other days I was very scared and very uncertain. So overall, I feel in peace today about it, and so I'm very happy about that decision.\"\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals, beating Simona Halep along the way.\n\nCornet's career will also be remembered for a run of three successive wins over Serena Williams in 2014 - including dumping the 23-time Grand Slam champion out of Wimbledon in the third round.\n\n\"The quarter-finals in Australia was the source of a lot of emotions,\" she said on making the last eight at a Slam for the first time at the 63rd attempt.\n\n\"My win over Serena was strong, intense, it was a source of great joy. But the quarter-finals - I had been running after this quarter-final for such a long time, and also winning against Simona Halep with that heat, well, it was overwhelming.\n\n\"I think I will remember that.\"\n\nCornet ended her career on home soil with a 20th French Open appearance.\n\nShe was also a ball girl at the tournament as a child, including for a match featuring former world number one Amelie Mauresmo, now the tournament director who presented her with an award on Tuesday.\n\n\"It was wonderful,\" she said of being a ball girl.\n\n\"It was a first experience where I was close to the players. When I think back now, Amelie Mauresmo is handing me the end-of-career trophy, and she's been there all the time.

It marked a swift end in what was her 69th consecutive major main draw appearance, a record streak among women's players.\n\nHaving announced last month her decision to retire after this year's French Open, Cornet was reduced to tears when Rafael Nadal sent her a personal message. The Roland Garros legend contacted his peer in a video message, which clearly meant a lot given the status of the one sending it.\n\nUpon learning of her decision to retire after this year's tournament, Nadal paid tribute to her career in an interview with Canal+ (via the Express), where he said: \"Bonjour Alize, I just want to congratulate you for an amazing career. I just want to wish you the very best for whatever you decide to do in the future. You're going to be - for sure - doing very well, but it's your day, enjoy and all the best for the future, congratulations.\"\n\nThe emotional response from Cornet to Nadal's video message was captured on camera, as she was evidently touched by the words from the tennis great. And Nadal's own French Open journey has possibly reached its own end after his defeat to Alexander Zverev.\n\nZheng, 21, offered her own glassy gesture after defeating Cornet on Tuesday. Instead of celebrating, she dedicated her success to honour the French star and even gave away her interview slot to spotlight Cornet.\n\n\"I was already crying watching Nadal's match yesterday,\" she said after viewing a montage of her sports career. \"Never been prepared for this moment, when you have to say goodbye to a page in my book, which has been turning for 30 years.\"\n\nThe tennis icon retires after playing 20 consecutive French Open tournaments. A whopping count of 72 total Grand Slam appearances puts her behind only the Williams sisters, Venus (92) and Serena (81).\n\nThe ex-world No. 11 progressed to at least the fourth round in all four Grand Slams and debuted in a major quarter-final at the 2022 Australian Open. She also boasts six WTA Tour titles, the most recent of which was won at the Swiss Open in 2018.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It was her first Grand Slam tournament.\n\nShe lost to compatriot and third seed Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo in the second round after beating Alina Jidkova who was nearly 600 places above her in the WTA rankings.\n\nIn 2024, with her ranking at 106, motivation decreasing and retirement judicious, the federation invited her once again to the Roland Garros stadium in the leafy western fringes of Paris for her last outings as a professional.\n\nSeventh seed Qinwen Zheng made it a simple outing. The 21-year-old from China dispatched Cornet 6-2, 6-1.\n\nZheng offered a classy ovation to Cornet after the 83-minute annihilation.\n\nMauresmo was at the end too in her guise as French Open tournament director. The former world number one and tennis federation boss Gilles Moretton led the applause after Cornet was presented with a trophy to hail her career and extend to 69 the record streak of consecutive appearances at the Grand Slam tournaments in Melbourne - where the run started in 2007 - Paris, London and New York.\n\nChange\n\n\"Since I was 15-years-old and my first Roland Garros here, I've been living for tennis most of the time,\" Cornet reflected an hour or so after the defeat.\n\n\"I organized my whole life around it,\" she added. \"It's a lot of work, a lot of sacrifices so at the end when you have to turn that page and when you realize it's over, it's a void. And you have to fill it in another way and find some stuff that makes you happy.\"\n\nCornet, 34, has laid out the lines. Four years ago she published Sans compromis - a book about her life on the tour. She says she plans to write more.\n\n\"The lifestyle will change completely,\" she said. \"That frightens me, because I have been working as a tennis player for 20 years. I need to find purpose again in my life. I need to plan ahead, to see and understand what I'm going to become.\n\n\"I know that I can work on myself and that I can work out a new state of mind. I am a resourceful person. I know that I will find new projects where I can blossom again.\"\n\nBut even though she never breached the top 10, she upset a fair few of the leading ladies including Serena Williams on her way to six singles crowns. Three doubles titles also adorn her trophy cabinet.\n\nA run to the last eight at the Australian Open in 2022 remains her best showing at a Grand Slam event.\n\n\"The quarter-finals in Australia was the source of a lot of emotions,\" she said. \"My win over Serena was strong, intense, it was a source of great joy. But the quarter-finals ... I had been running after a quarter-final for such a long time.\n\n\"I was already 32-years-old. It was a great highlight of my career. It was a beautiful, beautiful moment of my life.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, bosses of the women's tour added their tribute.\n\n\"Thank you for an amazing career,\" the WTA said on social media and posted photographs of her career highlights on the WTA website.\n\n\"I'd like to be remembered as a genuine player who shared all her emotions with everyone all throughout her career with a fighting spirit,\" Cornet said.\n\n\"I'd like them to remember someone who is a passionate tennis player, who likes to fight and who could die for it.\n\n\"I think I showed it several times. People may love me or not for that type of personality but this is what brought me until here.\"\n\nThe standing ovation and cheers as she departed centre court for the last time as a player should leave her little room for doubt.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_myers@rfi.fr", "name": "Paul Myers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliz\u00e9_Cornet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliz\u00e9 Cornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alina_Jidkova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alina Jidkova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/1b15ff74-1d16-11ef-8a1e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/mauresmo%20and%20cornet.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604399", "eventUri": "eng-9604399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Zheng raced into a 4-0 lead before Cornet clawed her way back.

Three points later, a drive volley saved a third match point, and the brass band that willed compatriot Gael Monfils to victory last night struck up once more.\n\nThe first shot was a fitting reprise before the denouement for Cornet -- a player with absolutely masterful tennis IQ, a penchant for slaying top-10 players when they least expected it, and a self-knowledge that her talents, in the era she played, would never quite nudge her into the stratospheres of the game that she so often brought down to earth.\n\nBorn in Nice, the 34-year-old had her most celebrated sequence 10 years ago, when she beat Serena Williams three times in 2014, most notably at Wimbledon. In a rain-delayed epic on Court One, Cornet triumphed in three sets having never beaten a top-25 player at a Grand Slam in 13 previous attempts. Cornet's grandmother had passed away before that match, and she had spent the preparation time on journeys to-and-from France making arrangements.\n\nHer reaction was fitting: \"It's the biggest upset of the tournament. A dream. I cannot believe I did it myself - me!\"\n\nOthers on her list of upsets include current world No 1 Iga Swiatek, also at Wimbledon in 2022; compatriot Caroline Garcia twice, in 2018; and Garbine Muguruza, who retired herself in April, at the 2022 Australian Open. She has 25 wins over top-10 players during her career, and reached the second week of every Grand Slam tournament, winning six WTA Tour titles and being ranked as high as world No 11. Her remarkable consistency of fitness was also noticeable, appearing in a record 69 consecutive Grand Slam events since the 2007 Australian Open.\n\nA master of disrupting rhythm with speed and spin, luring opponents into parts of the court on which she found her feet and on which they looked lost, Cornet's tennis IQ -- like that of many players -- also extended into wringing every last sense of an edge out of every situation, often with a signature note of dramatic flair. One of her most memorable Roland Garros matches came in 2016, when she defeated Germany's Tatjana Maria in three sets. Having cramped multiple times, and having dropped ice out of a pack meant for her leg while getting treatment at the end of the second set, Cornet had to be helped off court -- visibly agitated -- when 2-1 up in the third. She recovered to win, but Maria was apoplectic after the match, telling Cornet that she \"knew what she did\" and threatening to sue tennis' governing bodies over the application of medical treatment rules.\n\nSpeaking on court after her defeat, Cornet said that she had given everything to the sport, and that despite wanting to \"do more things\" in tennis, she knew it was time to call it quits. Cornet is a published author, with not a bad average on Goodreads (easier said than done), having published fiction in French as well as \"Transcendence: Diary of a Tennis Addict\". When reflecting on her career and what she has given and had taken away by tennis, she said that \"the inner child within me still likes to play tennis.\"\n\n\"When you live it so many times for such a long time, then you grow weary after sometime,\" she said.\n\nThe match at which it came to an end was symbolic. Flanked by an adoring crowd, against a player who outmatched her for power, movement, and ranking, at times she was able to force Zheng Qinwen to play her game; just not for long enough.\n\nIt didn't matter.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- France's Aliz\u00e9 Cornet on Tuesday played the last singles match of her career, falling to No.7 seed Zheng Qinwen in the first round at Roland Garros, where the Frenchwoman was appearing for the 20th time. The 34-year-old Cornet remains in contention in the tournament's mixed doubles competition, partnering her countryman Nicolas Mahut.\n\nBorn in Nice, France on Jan. 22, 1990, Cornet first appeared on the ITF Circuit in 2004 and the following year she made her tour-level main-draw debut as a 15-year-old wild card at Roland Garros. On that occasion, she won her opening match before running into Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo; two years later, Cornet won the 2007 Roland Garros girls' singles title. She also cracked the Top 100 for the first time.\n\nThe crafty righthander reached the first three final of her career in 2008, at Acapulco, Rome and then Budapest, where she captured her first singles title and the first of three career doubles titles. She finished that season ranked No.16 -- one of five illustrious teenagers in the year-end Top 20, alongside Victoria Azarenka, Dominika Cibulkova, Agnieszka Radwanska and Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nMaintaining her momentum, a breakthrough run to the Round of 16 at the Australian Open saw Cornet attain her career-high ranking of No.11 on Feb. 16, 2009. Although she would wait four years for a second singles title, the Frenchwoman ultimately contested 15 finals, her Budapest win being the first of six victories at the WTA 250 level, taking in 2012 Bad Gastein, 2013 Strasbourg, 2014 Katowice, 2016 Katowice and 2018 Gstaad.\n\nBut it is at the Slams that Cornet truly made the record books. She did not fail to appear in a Grand Slam main draw for a 69-tournament streak that ran from the Australian Open in 2007 to Roland Garros in 2024 -- an achievement unmatched in the women's game. She became the record-holder at the 2022 US Open, her 63rd Slam in a row, surpassing Japan's Ai Sugiyama.\n\nAlong the way, Cornet reached at least the Round of 16 at all four majors, including a career best quarterfinal at the Australian Open in 2022 -- setting the record for most appearances at a Grand Slam (63) before reaching the last eight. Among WTA players, her overall total of 72 Grand Slam main-draw appearances is surpassed only by Serena Williams (92) and Venus Williams (81).\n\n\"Aliz\u00e9's distinguished WTA results and incredible record of Grand Slam participation reflect supreme dedication to the game and a fierce competitive spirit,\" said Steve Simon, Chairman and CEO of the WTA. \"She can also be proud of her contribution as a role model who helped to grow women's tennis by engaging with fans, sponsors and media in a special way. On behalf of the WTA family, I wish her much happiness and success as she takes on new adventures.\"\n\nDuring her career, Cornet posted 25 Top 10 wins, including seven victories over Top 3 opponents: No.1 Serena Williams (2014 Dubai, 2014 Wimbledon and 2014 Wuhan, via ret.), No.3 Agnieszka Radwanska (2014 Katowice), No.2 Simona Halep (2015 Madrid), No.3 Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza (2022 Australian Open) and No.1 Iga Swiatek (2022 Wimbledon, ending the Polish player's 37-match win streak). Her wins over Serena made Cornet the first player to defeat the American in three straight meetings since Justine Henin in 2007.\n\nA four-time Olympian from Athens in 2008 through Tokyo in 2021, Cornet was also a stalwart for France's Billie Jean King Cup team, earning 27 nominations over a 14-year span -- including a non-playing role in the team's 2019 finals defeat over Australia in Perth. Additionally, she teamed with Jo-Wilfred Tsonga to win the Hopman Cup for France in 2014.\n\nShe leaves the sport with a singles win-loss record of 545-457 (.544), including 76-72 at the Slams, and career prize money exceeding $10 million.\n\nClick here for more on Cornet's standout career and a gallery of memorable moments.", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In addition to six singles titles to her name, she holds the record for the number of Grand Slams played in a row (69), a series that began at the Australian Open in 2007.\n\nEmotion gripped Cornet, receiving a standing ovation as soon as she entered the Philippe-Chatrier court, covered due to the rain falling on Paris, her smile nevertheless managing to hold back the tears, which would sooner or later end up flowing . This indeed happened after the tribute ceremony planned by the organizers, by viewing the video retracing his life and career. \"I'already cried yesterday (Monday) watching Rafael Nadal, so... And today, I had held on until now, but the emotion overwhelms me, she declared.\n\nHis final meeting didn't really start well. The Frenchwoman had great difficulty not only extricating herself from the pressure but also containing the aggressive play of Zheng, who was obviously not there to show off feelings. The 21-year-old Chinese, more aggressive, more powerful too, quickly broke away 4-0. At which point Cornet finally rebuffed. She, who has always been characterized by her combativeness on the courts, was faithful to her reputation, finally returning blow for blow and pushing her young rival into error and rewarded with a break (4-2).\n\nFeeling the danger looming under the cheers of a suddenly much warmer audience, Zheng then managed to tighten up his game to once again seize the service of the Ni\u00e7oise, otherwise weighed down , by a mediocre first ball (47% success), and pocket the first round in 50 minutes. In the second set, Cornet, who had just been broken, again did her best to erase this delay, but without converting her two opportunities. And it was Zheng, on the contrary, who hit the nail on the head to lead 4-1.\n\nIn her chair at the change of ends, the Frenchwoman did not mask her frustration, talking to herself while miming a poorly executed forehand, proof that she was still in her match. But not for much longer, because her opponent proved intractable until the end despite saving three match points in a final show of resistance.", "source": {"uri": "bobrtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bobrtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliz\u00e9_Cornet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliz\u00e9 Cornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604399", "eventUri": "eng-9604399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

and Alize Cornet have been Grand Slam stalwarts.\n\nTennis fan favourite Alize Cornet bid an emotional farewell to the sport on Tuesday, with the former world No 11 playing her last career match at the French Open.\n\nThe French star was widely known for her giant-killing exploits at majors - famously beating both Serena Williams and Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon - but was also hailed for her longevity.\n\nCornet made her Slam debut at Roland Garros 19 years ago, and up until her retirement she played in 69 straight majors, an epic streak that started at the 2007 Australian Open.\n\nThe Frenchwoman's longevity puts her towards the top in terms of WTA players with Grand Slam main draw appearances in the Open Era, with only two all-time greats ahead of her.\n\nWe take you through the five women with the most major appearances in the modern game.\n\nOne of the most celebrated figures in tennis history, Venus is a true legend of the sport and no woman in the Open Era can match her 93 Grand Slam main draw appearances.\n\nThe former world No 1 made her first major appearance at the 1997 French Open, reaching the second round at Roland Garros, and made her most recent appearance at the US Open last year.\n\nA winner of seven Grand Slam singles titles - five at Wimbledon, and two at Flushing Meadows - and runner-up in a further nine events, she is one of the most accomplished players of all time.\n\nVenus has missed the opening two majors of 2024, but appearances in either SW19 or New York are possible.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of her older sister, Serena's longevity also sees her feature incredibly high up in this list.\n\nShe was just 16 when making her debut at the Australian Open in 1998 and memorably said goodbye to the sport with a run to the third round of the US Open 24 years later.\n\nNo woman in the Open Era has won as many Slams as Serena, with 23 major singles victories - a total that means she won almost 30% of the Grand Slam tournaments she played during her career.\n\nThe first of her Grand Slam victories came at the 1999 US Open while her last triumph was at the 2017 Australian Open.\n\nCalling time on her career at her home Slam, 34-year-old Cornet sits third on the all-time list with an impressive 72 major appearances.\n\nThe Frenchwoman made her debut as a 15-year-old at Roland Garros in 2005, and almost two decades later finished her career on Court Philippe Chatrier - a loss to seventh seed Zheng Qinwen.\n\nHer 69 consecutive Grand Slam appearances is an all-time record - and one unlikely to be broken in the near future.\n\nAfter a consistent career, Cornet famously reached her first and only major quarter-final at the 2022 Australian Open, beating Simona Halep in the fourth round.\n\nA stalwart of the WTA Tour throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, only three women have played in more Grand Slam events than eight-time WTA titleist Frazier during the Open Era.\n\nThe American, who reached a career-high of 13th in 1995, made her Slam debut at the 1987 US Open and though she never officially confirmed her retirement, last played at the 2006 US Open.\n\nFrazier's best Slam runs came at the 1992 Australian Open and 1995 US Open, reaching the last eight at both events, while she also reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times.\n\nOne of the most talented players of her generation, former world No 2 Kuznetsova epitomized consistency throughout her lengthy career.\n\nThe Russian is probably best remembered for her triumphs at the 2004 US Open and 2009 French Open, reaching two further Grand Slam finals throughout her career.\n\nHer major journey started at the Australian Open when she was just 16 years old, reaching the second round of the event in 2002.\n\nShe last played at Wimbledon in 2021, losing in round one: she has not yet officially retired, but a return looks unlikely.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors":

It's a 20-year page that I'm turning and I'm going to a new chapter in my life.\n\n\"I wish I could have played better, but I gave everything I could to this sport.\"\n\nFormer Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina won 10 games in a row and yet was still an unconvincing winner against unseeded Belgian Greet Minnen.\n\nAn uneven match saw the 24-year-old from Kazakhstan turn a 2-0 deficit in the first set into a commanding 6-2 4-0 lead.\n\nFourth seed Rybakina then dropped serve twice as Minnen threatened a comeback, but regained her composure to wrap up a 6-2 6-3 victory.\n\nShe cut a surly figure with journalists afterwards, responding with answers including \"the questions are quite the same, so I don't know what to say anymore\" and \"simple question, simple answers. So, guys, something else?\"\n\nSecond seed Aryna Sabalenka was far more chipper after making short work of Russia's Erika Andreeva 6-1 6-2.\n\n\"I'm trying to do well on clay.

The final set of first-round matches features no shortage of exciting matchups. A few French veterans will try to triumph as underdogs and send the French crowd into a frenzy. Furthermore, a player who has quietly been one of the strongest players on the WTA Tour in recent months will look to continue the good times, while a battle between compatriots from a country that produces many strong clay court players will likely lead to going the way of the younger man.\n\nAll Tennis Odds & Lines come from DraftKings Sportsbook, but you can sometimes find better odds on some of these matches by checking mobile sportsbooks such as FanDuel Sportsbook, BetMGM, Caesars Sportsbook or any of the other top sports betting sites. We offer exclusive sign-up bonuses for some of those sportsbooks in states where sports betting has gone live.\n\nAll men's singles matches at Grand Slams, such as the French Open, are best of five sets, while women's singles matches are best of three sets. A mix of players' previous results on clay, recent form and stylistic matchups can help identify intriguing betting opportunities, both among favorites likely to cruise to victory and underdogs poised to pull off upsets. The aforementioned underdogs are highlighted in the Upset Alert section, the Lock It In section covers players who can safely be seen as overwhelming favorites, while the Value Bets section recommends tempting options in matchups considered closer to toss-ups.\n\nAlize Cornet (+950) vs. Qinwen Zheng\n\nCornet is a huge underdog against seventh-seeded Zheng, but don't be too quick to write off the French giants-killer, who has racked up numerous major victories in a Grand Slam career dating back to the 2005 French Open and amassed 25 top scores . -10 wins in total. It would be fitting for the 34-year-old Frenchwoman to add another major scalp to her collection in what Cornet has announced will be the final tournament of her career. Cornet will swing freely and draw crowd support against Zheng, who has an 8-7 record since a breakout performance at the Australian Open, where Zheng reached the final without having to beat a top 50 opponent.\n\nAdrian Mannarino (+290) vs. Giulio Zeppieri\n\nMannarino is just 7-12 in 2024 as he appears to be losing weight at age 35, but the veteran Frenchman is a nice value here against an unknown opponent. Zeppieri is just 1-4 in ATP main draw level matches this year and 5-13 in his career. In total, the 148th-ranked Italian has suffered eight defeats against players outside the top 100 in 2024. Despite all of Mannarino's struggles this year, he showed he still has the peak fitness needed to excel in best-of-five set play by winning three. five-setters at this year's Australian Open. Mannarino's strong second half of 2023, combined with that run down under, has him ranked 22nd, which is 88 places above Zeppieri's career high.\n\nFew players on the WTA Tour are better at avoiding setbacks at majors than Mertens, who has reached at least the third round in 23 of 24 Grand Slam appearances since the start of 2018, with just one first-round defeat in that span. The No. 25 seed will likely avoid a disappointment against 82nd seed Carle, who has split her 2024 season between WTA Tour and ITF level events. Carle has struggled when faced with competition at a higher level. In 2024, he went 4-5 against top 105 players, with only two wins against top 88 players.\n\nPetra Martic (-550) vs. Kristina Mladenovic\n\nMladenovic is still a decent doubles player, but the 31-year-old Frenchwoman has been a non-factor in singles for some time, having fallen out of the top 200 in the rankings. For Mladenovic's last win over a top 70 opponent you have to go all the way back to July 2022, and her last top 50 win came more than a year before that, so she's a far cry from the player who reached the French Open. quarterfinals in 2017. Martic struggled to a 5-10 record in 2024, but the 81st-ranked Croatian is 15-5 in Grand Slam first-round matches since early 2019, the year Martic reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros . Despite Martic's poor form this year, there is still a significant gap between her and Mladenovic at the moment. These two veterans have met nine times before, with Martic leading 7-2.\n\nBautista Agut is the much more talented of these two Spanish compatriots, but Munar is the better player at this stage of their respective careers. Munar is a .500 career player on clay, including a 9-8 ATP Tour record on surfaces this year, which does not include a challenger in France last month, in which Munar defeated three top-51 players to reach the final before he lost to the red-hot Alejandro Tabilo. 36-year-old Bautista Agut is nine years older than Munar and has fallen to 80th in the rankings, 17 places behind Munar. Including challengers and qualifying, the RBA is just 7-12 against the top 80 opponents in 2024.\n\nYulia Putintseva (-135) vs. Sloane Stephens\n\nPutintseva has had a strong last two months, reaching the quarter-finals at WTA-1000 level in both Miami and Madrid, with the latter result coming on clay. She took down two top-10 finishes in Madrid, beating Qinwen Zheng and Daria Kasatkina. Putintseva added a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Stephens at the Italian Open after that run in Madrid, and she will be looking for a repeat result in this rematch less than three weeks later. Stephens has the better reputation as a former French Open finalist (2018), and the American is ranked 35th, four places ahead of Putintseva. However, recent trends suggest this is the match Putinseva must lose, as Stephens enters the French Open on a four-match losing streak.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news",

She made her debut at Roland Garros in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.\n\nThe 34-year-old\u00b4s run of consecutive appearances at the majors smashed the previous women\u00b4s record of 62 set by Japan\u00b4s Ai Sugiyama. \"Emotionally it was not easy,\" said Cornet on her decision to retire after a 20-year professional career.\n\n\"Some days I was really excited about retirement and some other days I was very scared and very uncertain. So overall, I feel in peace today about it, and so I\u00b4m very happy about that decision.\"\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals, beating Simona Halep along the way.\n\nCornet\u00b4s career will also be remembered for a run of three successive wins over Serena Williams in 2014 -- including dumping the 23-time Grand Slam champion out of Wimbledon in the third round. \"The quarter-finals in Australia was the source of a lot of emotions,\" she said on making the last eight at a Slam for the first time at the 63rd attempt.\n\n\"My win over Serena was strong, intense, it was a source of great joy. But the quarter-finals -- I had been running after this quarter-final for such a long time, and also winning against Simona Halep with that heat, well, it was overwhelming.\n\n\"I think I will remember that.\" Cornet ended her career on home soil with a 20th French Open appearance.

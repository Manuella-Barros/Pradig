The resolution may not be what many expected.\n\nFor the most part Cora - whose current contract is set to expire at the end of the season - did not discuss his future with the Red Sox this season. The most recent update came on Opening Day, when Cora said he hadn't discussed a new deal with the team.\n\nWhile nothing had been said publicly since then, clearly there were talks behind the scenes. That progress was finally made public on Wednesday, when ESPN's Jeff Passan was the first to report that Cora and the Sox were nearing an agreement on a long-term extension.\n\nIt only took a few hours for the details of the extension to come out. According to Jon Heyman of MLB Network, Cora is getting a three-year deal worth over $21 million per year. That would make Cora the second-highest-paid manager in baseball behind Chicago Cubs skipper Craig Counsell, who got a five-year, $40 million contract back in November.\n\nThat price reflects Cora's standing in the league. Had his contract run out, he was expected to be one of the most sought-after free agent managers in recent history. Instead, the Red Sox are now in line to keep him in the organization for the foreseeable future.\n\nCora's first stint with the Red Sox came as a player, from 2005-2008. After he retired he got into coaching and was the Houston Astros' bench coach in 2017 before being hired as the Red Sox manager in 2018. In his first year with the club the team won the World Series, but Cora and the Red Sox mutually parted ways following the 2019 season due to his involvement in the Astros' sign-stealing scandal.\n\nPrior to the 2021 season Cora was re-hired by the Red Sox, starting his current contract. Over his five-plus non-consecutive seasons, Cora has posted a 493-412 record with the Red Sox, with two trips to the playoffs and the one World Series win in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/07/USATSI_23614813-2_1721852799_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

It sounds like the two sides would like to change that, as there is reportedly \"momentum\" toward Cora receiving a multiyear extension from Boston.\n\nThat big news comes via ESPN's Jeff Passan and Buster Olney, who reported Wednesday that the Red Sox and Cora have engaged in recent extension talks. Cora didn't want to hold contract negotiations during the season and has side-stepped questions regarding his future in Boston throughout the year, but the skipper has apparently had a change of heart.\n\n\"There is momentum toward a deal,\" Passan and Olney reported Wednesday. \"After months of silence regarding Cora's lame-duck status, a multiyear contract is a real possibility.\"\n\nCora is one of the best managers in baseball, and currently has the Red Sox at 54-46 heading into Wednesday's rubber match against the Rockies in Colorado. Boston sits one game back of the Kansas City Royals for the final Wild Card spot in the American League.\n\nSitting in the thick of the AL playoff race is a surprising spot for a Boston team that didn't have much buzz entering the season. But Cora has been able to guide the squad through a litany of injuries, especially in the rotation, and has the Red Sox in playoff contention. Boston went 31-18 from May 19 to the All-Star break, which was the best record in baseball over that span.\n\nCora is in his sixth season as manager of the Red Sox and owns a career record of 494-416 in his managerial career.

He said in May that he didn't plan on discussing his contract openly during the season, leading many to believe he would hit the open market.\n\nAfter what happened with Craig Counsell and the Milwaukee Brewers last fall, Cora becoming a free agent could have driven his price through the roof. It also could have led to him joining another club, potentially even rivals like the Los Angeles Dodgers or New York Yankees.\n\nPer Passan and Olney, though, there is momentum building towards a multi-year deal that would keep Cora in Boston moving forward.\n\nCora initially joined the Red Sox ahead of the 2018 campaign. In his first year at the helm, he led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and their ninth World Series championship.\n\nAfter missing the postseason by 12.0 games in 2019, Cora was suspended for all of 2020 due to his role in the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal. The Red Sox welcomed Cora back on a new deal in 2021, immediately returned to the ALCS, then picked up the two option years on his contract for 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe next two seasons didn't go as smoothly for Cora, however, as Boston finished 2022 and 2023 with identical 78-84 records. Cora's seat was heating up accordingly heading into 2024 and ownership did not settle his contract situation before the season began.\n\nCora has helped the Red Sox get back on their feet this year, leading the team to a 54-46 record. A four-game losing streak coming out of the All-Star break bumped Boston out of an AL Wild Card spot, but the team is still just 1.0 game back of the Kansas City Royals with 62 games left on the slate.\n\nThe Red Sox own the best record in MLB since May 19 at 32-22. Their pitching staff ranks sixth in ERA on the season, while their lineup ranks fourth in both batting average and OPS.\n\nBack in Feburary, the 48-year-old Cora told reporters he would not be managing 10 years from now. As a result, it remains to be seen just how long he plans on staying in Boston, even with an extension potentially on the horizon.\n\nCora recently moved into fourth place on the Red Sox's all-time managerial wins leaderboard. If he does come back for 2025 and beyond, he is sure to pass Mike Higgins for third and trail only Joe Cronin and Terry Francona.\n\nWith a 494-416 career record to his name, Cora should become the 13th active manager to reach 500 wins within the next week or two.\n\nCora played 14 seasons in the big leagues from 1998 to 2011 - including seven with the Dodgers and four with the Red Sox - before he became the bench coach in Houston and the manager in Boston. He racked up 828 hits and a 7.0 WAR before calling it quits, serving as a key player on the Red Sox's 2007 World Series team.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_connon@si.com", "name": "Sam Connon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cronin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Cronin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Francona", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry Francona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8640,h_4860,x_0,y_306/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j3jzf803tbq2452jzk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-19", "textStart": 1896, "textEnd": 1902}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Nice to see a three year deal done by Craig Breslow and the front office. Cora is arguably the best manager in baseball. All of his players love him and would literally run through a brick wall for him. Such a smart move that will pay off long term for the organization as the Red Sox will continue to be competitive. Below is my quick take on this as seen in The Times Union:\n\nAlex Cora should win American League manager of the year and the Boston Red Sox won't allow Cora to manage elsewhere next season. Boston is locking Cora up for three more years with an extension that will pay him $7 million per year. Cora has earned it because this year's team is overachieving and it's because Cora knows how to motivate players and get them to play up to their expectations and in some cases beyond. His teams are always well prepared, and they play the game the way it's supposed to be played. If Boston makes the playoffs, it's because of Cora and the job he has done.\n\nCora won the Red Sox their last World Series back in 2018 and virtually all of the fanbase defends him as they should. He is a brilliant baseball mind and his approach to managing and understanding what it takes to win.

Boston trails Kansas City (56-46) by 1.5 games for the final American League wild-card spot prior to the Royals' game Wednesday night.\n\n\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job; that respect has only grown these last several months,\" Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said in a statement. \"He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching firsthand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future.\n\n\"I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow.\"\n\nCora's deal had set to expire after this season, his sixth as Red Sox manager.\n\n\"What this organization means to us is the world,\" Cora said Wednesday. \"They trusted me from day one, they doubled down on me in '21 after everything that happened in '17. There were a lot of conversations in the offseason, and I just want to be happy and comfortable.\"\n\nComing off back-to-back 78-84 seasons and last-place finishes in the American League East, the Red Sox have thrived despite carrying their lowest Opening Day payroll in a decade at just over $170 million. The steady production of star third baseman Rafael Devers and emergence of center fielder Jarren Duran and starter Tanner Houck have thrust the Red Sox into the playoff picture, and with a core of young position players nearing the big leagues, Boston's future is on the upswing.\n\nWhether that future would include Cora was a question that has hung over the organization all season. Regarded as one of the game's best managers, Cora has left Boston before -- after he was fired prior to the 2020 season following the revelation of his prominent role in the Houston Astros' 2017 sign-stealing scheme.\n\nBoston re-hired Cora in 2021, turning back to the manager who had won a World Series with the Red Sox in his first season as manager in 2018. The Red Sox made a surprising run to the ALCS in 2021 but the team has been turned over almost entirely since then, and their two big free agent signings -- shortstop Trevor Story and outfielder Masataka Yoshida -- have been injured and disappointing, respectively.\n\nThe deal keeps Cora from hitting free agency a year after Craig Counsell's contract with the Milwaukee Brewers expired and he joined the Chicago Cubs on a five-year, $40 million contract.\n\nCora said in March he didn't expect talks on an extension to continue during the season. But he said Wednesday discussions had been ongoing recently with Breslow.\n\n\"Sometimes I put an act on for (the media),\" Cora said with a chuckle. \"I was actually telling the truth.

Despite an insistence that he wasn't going to talk about his employment status while entering the 2024 season in a lame-duck status, the Sox put an offer in front of the longtime skipper that was too good to pass up.\n\nAs a result, the would-be hottest managerial candidate on the market this winter is now slated to call Fenway Park home at least through 2027.\n\nThe borderline shocking development answered a lot of questions Red Sox fans probably had as his current deal neared its end. Among them are:\n\nWill Alex Cora be the manager of the Red Sox in 2025 and beyond?\n\nA softball start. The answer, of course, is an emphatic yes. This would be a hard thing to look up and quantify, but anecdotally, it does seem rare that a manager or coach reaches the end of a deal as a lame duck and still returns. For that reason alone, there were legitimate questions about whether Cora would be in the Boston dugout on Opening Day in 2025. That calculus was complicated by uncertainty and lack of clarity about just how good the team would be in 2024 and beyond. Thanks in large part to Cora, this is a team ready to contend for a playoff spot this season, so it's pretty evident things are headed in the right direction.\n\nHow does Craig Counsell's baseball-altering contract affect Cora's negotiations?\n\nCounsell became the highest-paid manager in baseball when he defected from Milwaukee for the Cubs, a division rival. His five-year, $40 million deal was expected to be an industry-resetting standard. Cora actually has a World Series ring as a manager, and with him set to hit the market, the assumption was he'd get something that eclipsed Counsell. The Counsell deal probably was some sort of benchmark for negotiations, but it's still a little surprising the reported terms of Cora's deal -- three years, $21.75 million -- fell short of Counsell.\n\nWhat's the No. 1 priority for Cora when it comes to 2025 and beyond?\n\nKind of tied into the previous inquiry, but Cora made it clear both with his actions and then his words that money wasn't necessarily the primary motivator. Cora spoke Wednesday about how comfortable the Red Sox have made him dating back to his playing days, and it's clear that comfort in Boston was a major reason he's staying put.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable,\" Cora said. \"I love wearing this uniform. I love the passion this city brings on a daily basis whether we're winning or losing. ... I love everything that comes with this uniform. I love everything that comes with the Red Sox.\"\n\nWill Craig Breslow look elsewhere to hire \"his\" manager after Cora's contract ends?\n\nQuite frankly, Breslow and Cora started their professional relationship in a weird spot. Cora having to adjust to an entirely new baseball operations direction ahead of the final year of his deal is uncomfortable. Breslow, meanwhile, came in knowing how much sway Cora carried in the organization while being tasked with being the one responsible for determining his future. On top of that, it would have been perfectly understandable to believe Breslow would get a chance to bring in \"his guy\" at some point to take over in the clubhouse and dugout.\n\nThere's no reason to believe there's any sort of friction between the two, though. Breslow spoke very highly of Cora after the announcement, and just as important, it's what Cora said that speaks to the general effectiveness of the duo.\n\n\"There's more structure, and the philosophy's different, and it's going to keep growing,\" Cora said of Breslow's organizational pitching overhaul. \"The draft was kind of a very telling thing to what we were kind of a very telling thing of what we were trying to accomplish not only the present but the future.\"\n\nDoes Cora believe he can win (again) with the Red Sox?\n\nUltimately, this is the most important question for all involved. There's no guarantee the Red Sox win the World Series again with Cora at the helm, but you have to believe he wouldn't have been as keen on staying if he didn't believe in the direction of the franchise. That on its own should make Red Sox fans happy about the news.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_cole@nesn.com", "name": "Mike Cole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/Alex-Cora-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

While the players deserve credit for going out and performing at a high level, manager Alex Cora also deserves his due praise for helping turn a team that was widely expected to finish at the bottom of their division into a playoff contender.\n\nConsidering the fact that he's in the final year of his contract, questions about Cora's future with the team have been swirling throughout the season. And while he had previously been murky about his standing with the team, reports have surfaced suggesting that Cora and the Sox are making progress on a new extension that would see him remain the manager of the team for the foreseeable future.\n\nVia Jeff Passan:\n\n\"News: The Boston Red Sox and manager Alex Cora have engaged in recent talks on a contract extension, and there is momentum toward a deal, sources tell me and Buster Olney. After months of silence regarding Cora's lame-duck status, a multiyear contract is a real possibility.\"\n\nRed Sox hoping to secure Alex Cora's future with the team\n\nPrior to this report, it was fair to wonder whether Cora would stay in Boston past this season. He had been tight-lipped about a potential extension, and he hasn't appeared to be all that pleased with ownership's lack of financial commitment to building the roster. Rumors swirled that he could leave for another team over the offseason, and given the team's expectations entering the year, many fans assumed he was heading for the exit door after the 2024 campaign.\n\nInstead, the Red Sox have been one of the most surprising teams in the MLB this season, and it now seems like Cora could end up sticking around for a bit longer. While nothing is finalized yet, the same reports have suggested that the potential range for this deal could end up being three years, $21.75 million, which would be the second-highest yearly salary for a manager in the MLB.\n\nVia Buster Olney:\n\n\"The deal that the Red Sox and Alex Cora have been discussing, first reported by Jeff Passan, is in the range of three years, $21.75m. It would be the second-highest salary for a manager, behind Craig Counsell's 5-year, $40m deal.\"\n\nThis would be a huge win for the Sox, as Cora has established himself as one of the best managers in all of baseball. While his involvement in the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal is obviously a black mark on his legacy, he's managed to overcome that and find his way in Boston. And if he were to put pen to paper to this new deal, he would continue to try to bring the team back to the championship heights he led them to back in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Boston-Alex-Cora-contract-extension-talks-heating-up.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Rhona Wise-USA TODAY Sports / Rhona Wise-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Boston Red Sox may not need to find a new manager after the 2024 season despite rumors saying other wise.\n\nBoston currently boasts one of the best managers in baseball in Alex Cora. Cora has been a revelation since taking over the team's manager spot in 2018. The 48-year-old quickly developed into one of the league's most respected managers and immediately led Boston to the World Series in 2018.\n\nCora has proved time and time again that he knows how to get the best out of his team but there have been rumblings that he could end up leaving in the offseason. His contract will be up at the end of the 2024 campaign and initially, it seemed like the two sides were going to wait until after the season to see if they could come together on a new deal.\n\nWith the Chicago Cubs inking Craig Counsell to a five-year, $40 million, some have speculated that could be a range Cora will be in the market for and other teams would have interest after the season.\n\nWhile this is the case, other teams may not end up having a chance to land Cora after all as the two sides reportedly have been discussing a new deal recently and there's \"momentum\" for a multi-year deal, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan and Buster Olney.\n\n\"News: The Boston Red Sox and manager Alex Cora have engaged in recent talks on a contract extension, and there is momentum toward a deal, sources tell me and Buster Olney,\" Passan said. \"After months of silence regarding Cora's lame-duck status, a multiyear contract is a real possibility.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean a contract will get done, but it is a fantastic sign. Plus, when someone like Passan or Olney speaks, people should listen. They are two of baseball's best insiders and if they are saying there's a possibility a new contract gets done, there really is a chance.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoanDepot_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LoanDepot Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4146,h_2332,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_red_sox/01j3k0anp29e7f8jsner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

He's also said that he would like work in a front-office capacity, though he took himself out of consideration for the job that eventually went to Breslow.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Roenicke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron Roenicke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/b3/ab396c4f-fd4c-50c3-b108-e197eff4608c/66a156730fb9c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Cora had been in the final year of his contract and was expected to be a sought-after managerial free agent this coming offseason. The deal is worth roughly $21.75 million, according to ESPN, which makes him the second-highest paid manager behind Craig Counsell of the Cubs.\n\n\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job; that respect has only grown these last several months,\" said Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow in a statement released by the team. \"He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching firsthand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future. I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow. I congratulate him, Angelica, and their family.\"\n\n\"Today is about the Cora-Feliciano family,\" Cora said in that same statement. \"We love Boston and are very comfortable here. The Red Sox gave us a chance back in 2017 and doubled down on us prior to the 2021 season, and I'm happy to say our future is here as well. I'd like to thank John Henry, Tom Werner, Mike Gordon, Sam Kennedy, and Craig Breslow for their confidence in me. I'm excited about not only where we are as an organization, but also where we are going.\"\n\nCora, 48, is in his sixth season as Red Sox manager (2018-19, 2021-24). At 54-47, the club sits a game-and-a-half out of the third American League wild-card spot, and they are outperforming preseason expectations. Boston went 78-84 in both 2022 and 2023, and was a last-place team both years. The Red Sox went 92-70 in 2021 and made a run to the ALCS.\n\nThe Red Sox won a franchise record 108 games and the World Series title in 2018, Cora's first season as manager. They went 84-78 the next year, then Cora served his one-year suspension for his role in the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal in 2017. Cora was Houston's bench coach in 2017 and MLB's investigation revealed he was central to the scheme.\n\nBoston quickly rehired Cora once his suspension ended after the 2020 season. All told, the Red Sox are 494-416 (.543) with one World Series title and another ALCS trip under Cora. Those 494 wins are the fourth most in franchise history behind Joe Cronin (1,071), Terry Francona (744), and Pinky Higgins (560). A multi-year deal could put Francona's total within reach for Cora.\n\nThis past offseason, Counsell reset the managerial market with his five-year, $80 million contract with the Chicago Cubs.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_axisa@cbssports.com", "name": "Mike Axisa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kennedy_(baseball_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Kennedy (baseball executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John W.

Pegged by many to end the season with yet another last-place finish, Boston enters Wednesday's action with a 54-46 record. Not only are they just 1.0 game back of the third Wild Card spot, but they trail the first-place Orioles by just 6.0 games in the AL East. Crazier things have happened.\n\nWhile the players obviously deserve credit for exceeding expectations, Alex Cora's contributions cannot be overstated. The work he has done not only this season but in his six seasons with Boston is why he is considered one of the best managers in the game.\n\nCora being as elite of a manager as he is was why Red Sox fans have gone through this season terrified about the possibility of losing him after this season, particularly if their arch-rivals, the New York Yankees, got him.\n\nThankfully for Red Sox fans, ESPN's Jeff Passan came out with a bombshell report saying that Cora is nearing a multi-year extension to remain in Beantown.\n\nRed Sox fans don't have to worry about worst-case scenario with Alex Cora nearing multi-year extension\n\nTo get Cora to agree to sign now, the Red Sox would have to pay him handsomely. According to Buster Olney of ESPN, they're planning on doing just that, giving Cora one of the richest contracts for a manager.\n\nFor much of this season, it felt inevitable that Cora's tenure in Boston was all but over. The Red Sox had made little to no effort to get better last offseason and frankly have not spent like the big market giants that they are for years now. Cora had reason to at the very least test the free agent waters. He was sure to garner tons of interest, much like Craig Counsell did last offseason.\n\nHad Cora tested free agency, would there have been a more appealing destination than New York? The Yankees are a team that at the very least has more star power than Boston, and an argument could be made that playing for Aaron Boone has held the team back. Can you imagine this Yankees team with Cora in the dugout? Would they look as bad as they do right now?\n\nThere's nothing Red Sox fans despise more than seeing the Yankees win, and Cora landing in the Bronx would only help New York do just that.\n\nBarring a drastic shift, it sounds like the Red Sox have avoided their own version of the Craig Counsell situation.

What this organization means to us is the world,\" Cora said. \"They trusted me from day one. I still remember that meeting in the palace in New York with Dave (Dombrowski) and the group, they doubled down on me in '21 after everything that happened from '17. And we've been talking for a little bit here, talking to Angelica and Camila, and this is home for us.\"\n\nCora said he's been in talks with the front office for the past few weeks, and his main priority was putting his family in the best position possible.\n\n\"I just want to be happy and comfortable,\" Cora said. \"The boys are seven, Camila is going to graduate from college next year, Angelica loves the city, the support system that we have in the city and from people back home, it's very easy. We put everything on a scale and we decided this is a great opportunity for us to keep growing as a family, obviously to keep growing as a manager, the baseball part of it I feel very comfortable with where we're at right now and where we're going is what I want.\n\n\"I've been talking to Craig (Breslow) for a little bit here and there were two things I wanted, I wanted to win and I wanted security for my family,\" he continued. \"And we have accomplished both.\"\n\nCora went on to say his relationship with Breslow has grown since he was hired as Boston's new chief baseball office this past fall and that he's confident in the club's direction on the field. Breslow praised Cora and his leadership in a statement announcing the extension.\n\n\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job; that respect has only grown these last several months,\" Breslow said. \"He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching firsthand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future. I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow. I congratulate him, Angelica, and their family.\"\n\nCora's extension immediately resolves one of the biggest sources of uncertainty the Red Sox faced going forward. Cora's current deal in Boston was set to expire after this season, and if he had reached free agency Cora would've immediately become the most highly sought after managerial candidate of the offseason.\n\nAfter Craig Counsell reset the market for managers with his five-year, $40 million contract with the Chicago Cubs last winter, the expectation was Cora could command similar money. Given the club's recent frugality, it wasn't clear if the Red Sox would be willing to make that kind of commitment.\n\nFor his part, Cora had refused to discuss his contract status or his future in Boston publicly. The only major update he's provided since opening day was that he and the team had tabled any discussions and didn't plan to hold any negotiations until after the season.\n\n\"We're not talking about contracts during the season,\" Cora said on May 31. \"We'll play it out and whatever is decided is decided.\"\n\nCora has reiterated that stance on a number of occasions, but at some point over the course of the season things changed.\n\n\"At the end of the day there are probably a lot of places that are going to open up at the end of the season, and some of them may be very inconvenient for the family. I promise you this decision was more based on the comfort of my family than actually my professional career,\" Cora said. \"Life has taught me through the years that comfort and taking care of the family is more important and that's one of the reasons we decided to engage and finally we got it done.\"\n\nNow he and the Red Sox look set to stick together for years to come.\n\nCora already ranks as one of the most accomplished managers in team history, having won a World Series title in 2018 before climbing to fourth in franchise history with 494 wins. He initially managed two seasons between 2018-19 before he was fired ahead of the 2020 season due to his involvement in the Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal, but was rehired after his year-long suspension ended and has managed continuously since 2021.\n\nThis season the Red Sox have been among the biggest surprises in baseball. Coming off back-to-back 78-84 seasons, the Red Sox have surged back into playoff contention thanks in large part to the development of the club's young core, particularly first-time All-Stars Tanner Houck and Jarren Duran.\n\nThe news of Cora's extension was greeted with enthusiasm from his players.\n\n\"He's an awesome person, not just as a manager but as a personal friend so I'm so happy and thankful he's going to be here,\" Duran said.\n\n\"He's the leader of this team, he shows up every day for us and he's been tremendous since I've been here and even before,\" said right-hander Nick Pivetta. \"We're really lucky to have such a great manager like that and it's awesome for him to be able to feel comfortable moving through the next couple of years.\"\n\nBeyond providing a massive boost to the organization, Cora's extension could also be the first of several developments for the club, which is expected to pursue external reinforcements ahead of next week's trade deadline. The club has long spoken about building towards sustained success, and this deal ensures Cora will remain the one leading the club into the future as it seeks to turn that long-term vision into a reality.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Heyman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Heyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarren_Duran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarren Duran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Houck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Houck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/299/29923/2992309.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 3423, "textEnd": 3429}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The Red Sox have shaped a large portion of his life.\n\nThat brought him to an important decision that hit the public eye on Wednesday.\n\nCora and the Red Sox officially extended his contract for three more years through the 2027 season, as Boston confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nFrom his initial hire in the fall of 2017 to returning for after the 2020 season, Cora knows that outside of his home in Puerto Rico, Boston is where he belongs.\n\n\"We've been talking for a little bit here,\" Cora told reporters after Wednesday's loss, per NESN's postgame coverage. \"Talking to (my family), this is home for us. People can speculate whatever. There were a lot of conversations in the offseason that this might happen or he wants to get paid or whatever. I just want to be happy and comfortable.\"\n\nAs he always has and especially echoed in recent months, Cora is truly a family man. His close circle consistently shapes his decision-making and played a major role in his decision to keep his future with the Red Sox. He voiced his excitement for his children to keep growing in Boston in an extended chapter for his family.\n\nAs for his duties in the dugout, the Red Sox have taken steps forward with a franchise talent in Rafael Devers growing into a leader as the organization improves its internal pitching pipeline. Those factors are positive signs for a bright future that's arrived in Boston.\n\n\"The baseball part of it, I feel very comfortable with where we're at right now and where we're going,\" Cora said. \"It's what I want. ...

Finally, we got it done.\"\n\nCora didn't expect in-season negotiations, but improved relationships with Breslow and front office allowed an expedited process. Now, the 48-year-old gets to continue a rewarding path with the Red Sox with those who mean the most of him surrounding him.\n\n\"I love wearing this uniform,\" Cora assessed. \"I love the passion that this city brings on a daily basis, regardless if we're winning or losing. ... I love everything that comes with this uniform. I love everything that comes with the Red Sox.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, the Red Sox manager expressed a central theme on Wednesday: gratitude.\n\n\"I'm a grateful kid from Caguas, Puerto Rico,\" Cora said. \"Here I am.\"", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_crowley@nesn.com", "name": "Tim Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caguas,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caguas, Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caguas, Puerto Rico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/alex_cora.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

And for the past five months, it appeared that's what would happen. Across baseball, it was taken as a given, and it seemed that way to those involved, too: When Cora spoke with Boston Red Sox owner John Henry early this year, there was an understanding that whatever happened this season, any conversation about a new contract would be deferred until after this year.\n\nThat the Red Sox would wait made sense, given their recent context. They have slashed payroll and they brought in a new head of baseball operations in Craig Breslow, meaning that Cora was working for an executive who didn't hire him. Friends of Breslow have wondered how he would work with Cora, given some differences in their personalities.\n\nCora, too, had reason to wait; as one of the most respected men in the position, he had the chance to continue to push the salary ceiling, like Counsell did in signing a record deal with the Cubs.\n\nBut Breslow recently asked Cora to meet him at his home, and that conversation developed the first steps toward a three-year, $21.75 million contract that gives Cora the second-highest salary for any manager, behind Counsell. Cora, 48, is getting the first really big payday of his baseball life, and the peers who wanted the best for Cora were thrilled. \"He earned it!\" texted one.\n\nFor the Red Sox, the signing of Cora goes well beyond the dugout -- his retention is a symbol of organizational credibility for a team that needs that. No matter what happens before next week's trade deadline, the signing of Cora is likely to be the most difference-making move the Red Sox will make -- and certainly the most expensive.\n\nThe extension is also an endorsement of the way Cora manages, connecting with players through constant communication, regardless of their level of stardom or talent. When Rafael Devers was a young player, Cora worked to reward his efforts to get better defensively, encouraging him to improve his conditioning. He has been a big supporter of Jarren Duran, getting emotional when he announced to the team this month that Duran had been selected for the AL All-Star Game. When Duran hit a home run in the All-Star Game and was named the MVP, Cora texted him the same words he had told him over and over: \"I love you.\"\n\nWhen speaking about a poor performance, a mistake by one of his players, he'll acknowledge the problem through the use of the word \"we.\" \"We didn't make the pitch. We didn't make the play. We didn't catch the ball. We need to do better.\" But this is not to say Cora is soft. His starting pitchers know that getting caught on the phone when they retreat to the clubhouse between innings is a big no-no; he famously benched Alex Verdugo last year for not hustling.\n\nStill, Cora remains popular among his players in part because he has had a range of experiences, good and bad: a star collegiate player, a draftee of the Los Angeles Dodgers, a regular for a few years in L.A., then a part-time player. Terry Francona, the former Red Sox manager, asked him to mentor a young infielder named Dustin Pedroia, and this is how Cora became head counselor for a player who was effectively taking at-bats that might've otherwise gone to Cora. After 14 years as a player, Cora worked in television for ESPN, as a general manager for team Puerto Rico, and then as A.J. Hinch's bench coach with the Houston Astros.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Astros' sign-stealing scandal and Cora's one-season suspension for his role, he would open conversations with players new to the Red Sox by hitting that topic head on. \"He gave no excuses,\" said one player. \"He just owned it, and got it out of the way, and then moved on.\"\n\nCora won a championship with the Red Sox as a player in 2007, managed the team to its last title in 2018, and even with the team's struggles in recent seasons, he has been a constant, talking about winning and making adjustments in how he manages and in his own life. Late last season, Cora took up running and has talked about how much better he feels.\n\nThis offseason, the Red Sox made very few substantive moves (other than hiring Breslow), and what they do at the trade deadline is still to be decided. But they've been one of baseball's surprise teams, climbing closer in the wild-card chase and nearer the top of the AL East in recent weeks, and now they've made the first big move of late July.\n\nThere's plenty more to be done to remain competitive: Boston is in need of an injection of pitching, as borne out by Wednesday's horrific 20-7 loss to the Colorado Rockies; their rotation is thin and their bullpen could use a veteran or two. \"Right now, it's Kenley Jansen and a bunch of young guys,\" said one evaluator.\n\nIn the end, the Red Sox might not make the playoffs this year, and it's still unclear whether they will make the sort of aggressive player acquisitions -- \"full throttle\" -- that their unsatisfied fan base wants. But they have paid top-of-the market money to lock down their manager, and that will matter to a fanbase looking for something to cheer.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Verdugo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Verdugo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenley_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenley Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Hinch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.

That will make Cora the second-highest paid manager in baseball behind the Cubs' Craig Counsell, who is earning $8 million in the first year of a five-year, $40 million deal he signed last fall. In 2025, Cora will receive a raise of $4.5 million; he's making $2.75 million in 2024.\n\nThe news shocked many in baseball circles. Cora's current contract expires after the season and he previously said - quite adamantly, on numerous occasions - that he was not willing to discuss a contract during the season. It was thought Cora wanted to test free agency, as Counsell did last year, with big-market clubs like the Yankees, Phillies and Dodgers potentially looming if any of those jobs were to come open. In the end, Cora decided it was best for him and his family to stay in Boston, where he has managed for six seasons over two stints separated by a year-long suspension in 2020.\n\nIn a press release, both Cora and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow spoke about why the decision was made.\n\n\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job; that respect has only grown these last several months,\" said Breslow. \"He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching firsthand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future. I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow. I congratulate him, Angelica, and their family.\"\n\n\"Today is about the Cora-Feliciano family,\" said Cora. \"We love Boston and are very comfortable here. The Red Sox gave us a chance back in 2017 and doubled down on us prior to the 2021 season, and I'm happy to say our future is here as well. I'd like to thank John Henry, Tom Werner, Mike Gordon, Sam Kennedy and Craig Breslow for their confidence in me. I'm excited about not only where we are as an organization, but also where we are going.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCora was hired after the 2017 season and directed the Red Sox to the 2018 World Series title. After the 2019 season, he was implicated in the Houston Astros' 2017 sign-stealing scandal and eventually suspended by MLB for the 2020 season. He and the Red Sox \"mutually agreed\" to part ways, with Ron Roenicke hired to manage the Red Sox that season.\n\nOn the final weekend of the 2020 season, the Red Sox dismissed Roenicke, and in their search for a replacement, they returned to Cora, who directed the Red Sox to the 2021 ALCS before losing to the Astros in six games.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Red Sox finished out of the playoffs and in last place in the American League East.\n\nLast fall, when the Red Sox hired Breslow, the team's new chief baseball officer said he felt no urgency to address Cora's contractual situation, even as the manager neared the 2024 season as a potential lame duck.\n\nThat seemed OK with Cora, who in one of his first availabilities this past spring wouldn't answer a question about whether he wished to keep managing the club past 2024.\n\nThe team's surprising play through the first 100 games this season enhanced Cora's position, however.\n\nCiting the need to spend more time with his family, Cora has made no secret that he doesn't plan to be a managerial lifer, remaining in the dugout into his 60s and 70s. He's also said that he would like to work in a front office capacity, though he took himself out of consideration for the job that eventually went to Breslow.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nRockies match franchise scoring record in 20-7 rout of Red Sox Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_mcadammasslive_com@pressherald.com", "name": "Sean McAdammasslive.com", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kennedy_(baseball_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Kennedy (baseball executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John W.

He was hired before the 2018 season and led the Red Sox to a World Series title that year, his second with the franchise. He was a player on the 2007 championship team that swept the Rockies in the Fall Classic.\n\nCora was suspended by Major League Baseball for the 2020 season and fired by the Red Sox for his role in a 2017 sign-stealing scandal as bench coach of the Houston Astros. Boston rehired him in 2021 and he guided the club to a 92-70 record and a trip to the AL Championship Series.\n\nBoston endured consecutive 78-84 seasons in 2022 and \u00b423 but is 54-47 this year.\n\n\"What this organization means to us is the world,\" Cora said Wednesday. \"They trusted me from day one, they doubled down on me in \u00b421 after everything that happened in \u00b417.

But he said Wednesday discussions had been ongoing recently with team executive Craig Breslow.\n\n\"Sometimes I put an act on for (the media),\" Cora said with a chuckle. \"I was actually telling the truth. We\u00b4ve been talking for a few weeks and the relationship between me and Craig has grown the last six, seventh months.\"\n\nCora said his wife, Nilda, and their children are happy living in Boston.\n\n\"I promise you, this decision was more based on the comfort of my family than my professional career,\" he said.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora, right, chekcs in with home plate umpire Jeremie Rehak to make lineup changes in the eighth inning of a baseball game against the Colorado Rockies, Wednesday, July 24, 2024, in Denver.

But it's a welcome surprise because of what it means for the franchise.\n\nWith Cora signing on for three more seasons, the Red Sox have direction again. Craig Breslow wants to win, and he wants to win now, and Cora is on board for it. There is unity once again between the front office and the dugout.\n\nBreslow was in Colorado on Wednesday to finalize the deal, and received a hero's welcome from Boston players when they broke the news in the Red Sox clubhouse.\n\n\"How do you know that this was the right decision? When I walked into the clubhouse, I got a round of applause, which means obviously those players care about him,\" Breslow said, via RedSox.com. \"They know how special he is. I think the city of Boston knows how special he is. We're really excited about what we can do together.\"\n\nThe timing of the deal is surprising, and not just because it came on a day the Red Sox were trounced, 20-7, by the lowly Rockies. Cora said in spring training and at various times throughout the season that he didn't want to negotiate or talk about his contract. That created an uneasy feeling when it came to the beloved skipper in a lame-duck season, despite the team's success on the field. While the vibes were good on the diamond, there was a growing fear that Cora would be departing in the winter. Every Boston win just added to the dollar amount he would receive from a desperate contender in the offseason.\n\nIt led to speculation that Cora and Breslow -- the third head of baseball ops. during Cora's tenure as manager -- still weren't seeing eye-to-eye on things. If another trade deadline came and went without any help from the front office, it felt like Cora was as good as gone.\n\nThere had to be an indication from Breslow that the team will be active and aggressive at next week's trade deadline. Otherwise, Cora probably wouldn't have agreed to stick around.\n\n\"I've been talking to Craig for a little bit here,\" Cora said. \"There were two things that I wanted: I wanted to win, and I wanted security for my family. And we have accomplished both.\"\n\nCora praised Breslow for becoming a \"closer\" and getting the extension done. It sounds like their relationship has only grown stronger over the last several months, and the chief baseball officer and manager have a clear vision for the future -- together.\n\n\"Alex and I have had a relationship for a while, but it's developed over the last eight months or whatever it is,\" Breslow said of his skipper. \"I think in my position, you look for someone who's a partner in the manager's seat, someone who can question and challenge when it's appropriate, and do so in a productive way, who can champion what we're trying to do as an organization.\n\n\"I've seen that happen over the last several months. And beyond that, Alex is such a great connector of people. His ability to navigate a clubhouse and a front office and connect with veteran players and young players, and obviously being bilingual is an incredible benefit,\" he added. \"But I just think through time, we've grown much more comfortable with each other.

The team has not confirmed a new deal with Cora, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be a sought-after managerial free agent this offseason. The deal would be \"in the range\" of three years and $21.75 million, according to ESPN, which would make him the second-highest paid manager behind Craig Counsell of the Brewers.\n\nCora, 48, is in his sixth season as Red Sox manager (2018-19, 2021-24). At 54-46, the club sits a game out of the third American League wild-card spot, and they are outperforming preseason expectations.

The Red Sox went 92-70 in 2021 and made a run to the ALCS.\n\nThe Red Sox won a franchise record 108 games and the World Series title in 2018, Cora's first season as manager. They went 84-78 the next year, then Cora served his one-year suspension for his role in the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal in 2017. Cora was Houston's bench coach in 2017 and MLB's investigation revealed he was central to the scheme.\n\nBoston quickly rehired Cora once his suspension ended after the 2020 season.

His deal should make him baseball's second-highest paid manager behind Craig Counsell with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThat's deserved.\n\nTo the outside eye, Cora's tenure as the Red Sox manager has some areas that may have created doubt about that future. Boston has missed the postseason in each of the last two years and three times in five years. Those years, however, need deeper attention given how many injuries the ballclub endured and handcuffed Cora's ability to maximize the roster.\n\nTo that point, a healthy roster is all Cora's needed to create momentum in Boston.\n\n2018? The Red Sox won the World Series in the most dominant season in franchise history. 2021? Cora navigated the Red Sox from last place during his 2020 absence to an appearance in the American League Championship Series.\n\nFew managers in the sport can match the in-game impact that Cora provides. That's on full display as much as ever during this 2024 season.\n\nA young roster entered the season with a chance to grow and now sits right in the middle of a playoff race. Player relationships and choosing matchups drove the Red Sox to a hot stretch that turned the season around in June. Cora deserves plenty of credit.\n\nThe prime example? Pushing all of the right buttons in a thunderous comeback against the Toronto Blue Jays in June. Cora consistently talks about championship aspirations and set a tone that night with the NBA champion Boston Celtics looking on at Fenway Park.\n\nCora clearly connects well with the youthful bunch that's elevated the Red Sox this season. With the next core of young prospects being ready for a jump to Boston in 2025, Cora needs to be the one leading that group into the next chapter of contention. Now, he will be.\n\nCora is here to stay in Boston. He took care of his family. He's here to take care of his players.

My contract situation will be talked [about] after the last out, hopefully, of the World Series.\"\n\nIn that span of time, something seems to have changed.

He has been at the helm since.\n\nThe Red Sox retained Cora at the end of last season even as they fired chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom and hired Craig Breslow in his place. But Cora, who recently moved into fourth place all-time in franchise history in wins, entered 2024 in the final year of his contract with his future unknown.\n\nAt various points through this season when asked about returning as manager next season, Cora has demurred, but the news Wednesday marks a significant change in course.\n\nThe Red Sox, who battled a slew of injuries in the first half, forcing several rookies into prominent roles, have been one of the biggest surprises in baseball this season at 54-46 and one game back of the third American League wild card spot at the start of Wednesday.\n\nIf the extension does become finalized it also figures to be an indicator that the Red Sox are more solidly in the buyer's market as the deadline draws near.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jen_mccaffrey@nytimes.com", "name": "Jen McCaffrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Bloom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chaim Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/31185325/GettyImages-2151963245-scaled-e1717200350642.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 719, "textEnd": 725}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

With his previous contract set to expire at the end of this year, Cora has been asked about his future countless times over the last several months. He's deflected at nearly every opportunity, diplomatically answering that he didn't want to talk about contracts during the season, and was keeping his focus is on the team and their campaign. He's even asked the media why he kept getting the question. To the outside world, at least, it seemed there were no extension discussions happening at 4 Jersey Street during the ongoing season, let alone while the team was on a road trip to California and Colorado.\n\nExtending Cora makes sense. His players love and respect him. He's managed this club through the highest highs and lowest lows. He's shepherded this burgeoning young core of Rafael Devers - who debuted seven years ago Thursday and is the last remaining member of Cora's inaugural Red Sox team in 2018 - and Jarren Duran, Tanner Houck, among others. He's the fourth-winningest manager in franchise history, behind Joe Cronin, Terry Francona, and Pinky Higgins. He's led Boston to the postseason twice, including their MLB-leading fourth championship this century. And he played for the Red Sox and won a ring here, too; against the Rockies, coincidentally.\n\nWhether he wanted to stay in Boston, however, was unclear. After Francona's retirement announcement last October, Cora, one of several MLB managers who played for him, said he didn't plan on doing the job nearly as long as \"Tito.\" He's talked about doing baseball work back home in Puerto Rico, and not wanting to miss out on too much of his twin sons' childhood. (They turned seven while the Red Sox were on this week's road trip to Los Angeles and Denver.)\n\nThough Cora often speaks of his love for Boston, Fenway Park, and the Red Sox organization, he's admitted that last season took a toll on his mental and physical health. When he arrived at spring training 30 pounds lighter and announced he'd started running several miles every morning, he looked and sounded like a man ready for change. There's been speculation that several teams would make him offers if he became a free agent, including the Dodgers, Yankees, and Phillies, so if the Red Sox were going to continue not spending like a big-market team and be content finishing in last place again, he'd land on his feet.\n\nCora also knew that what he wanted would also be largely irrelevant if he wasn't the man the new Red Sox chief baseball officer wanted for the job; Craig Breslow could've chosen to ride out the year, thanked Cora for his contributions, and installed his own manager.\n\nIn flying to Colorado this week to ensure the deal got done, Breslow made it clear: this is his manager. Cora is the manager Breslow wants as the Red Sox prepare to add Marcelo Mayer, Kyle Teel, and Roman Anthony to the homegrown powerhouse they've been building, and the manager they see leading said powerhouse back to October.\n\nThe players certainly agree.\n\n\"How do you know that this was the right decision?\" Breslow told reporters. \"When I walked into the clubhouse, I got a round of applause.\"\n\nAccording to multiple sources in the organization, Cora has been talking about taking the team back to the World Series this year since the end of last season. But amidst a quiet offseason and an even lower payroll this year, it was unclear if ownership shared the skipper's goals and priorities.\n\nThat Cora not only agreed to discuss an extension midseason, but finalized one, is the strongest evidence we've seen in a long time that the Red Sox are prioritizing winning again.\n\n\"There were two things I wanted, I wanted to win and I wanted security for my family, and we have accomplished both,\" Cora told reporters. \"Where we're at, where we're going, is what I want.\"\n\nJust in time for the trade deadline this coming Tuesday, July 30. Breslow has confirmed the Red Sox plan to be buyers.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabrielle_starr@bostonherald.com",

The surprise success of the 2021 postseason run followed by the last-place finishes the next two years and now an upstart 2024 club.\n\nThe lone player left from that championship club, Rafael Devers, signed a $300 million-plus deal last year, but only after the team opted to trade a generational talent in Mookie Betts. In the midst of it all, there have been three changes in front office leadership over the last seven seasons, and \"full throttle\" declarations to spend only to reverse course.\n\nThat's why -- despite the odd timing a week before the trade deadline and despite a refusal all season to discuss contract talks -- the news of Cora's new deal with the Red Sox isn't all that surprising. The Red Sox on Wednesday officially announced a three-year extension with Cora that runs through 2027. Sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations told The Athletic that the deal is worth roughly $23 million.\n\n\"We're very happy, what this organization means to us is the world,\" Cora told reporters after Wednesday's season-worst 20-7 loss to the Rockies, which was another bit of odd timing. \"They trusted me from day one.\"\n\nThe $7.65 million average annual value of the deal comes in just shy of Craig Counsell's five-year, $40 million contract signed last winter with the Cubs, a record deal for a manager.\n\n\"We put everything on a scale and decided this is a great opportunity for us as a family and obviously to keep growing as a manager,\" Cora said on NESN. \"From the baseball part of it, I feel comfortable where we are at right now and where we are going is what I want. I've been talking to (chief baseball officer) Craig (Breslow) a little bit here, and there were two things I wanted: I wanted to win and I wanted security for my family, and we've accomplished both.\"\n\nIn recent years, following the direction of the Red Sox has often been like being stuck in a corn maze, the kind that stops being entertaining and the exit seems impossible to find. Ownership has said one thing and done another more times than can be counted. And yet through it all, their loyalty to Cora has been their clearest creed.\n\nCora's re-hiring after the 2020 suspension is the most obvious example of that relationship. But the fact that he's working for his third head of baseball operations says just as much about how he's viewed by ownership. New general managers typically have the luxury of hiring their own manager, but both Chaim Bloom and Breslow inherited Cora, with ownership seemingly saying: 'The job is yours, but Cora is staying.'\n\nNow they've extended Cora three more years.\n\nThat extension would give him nine seasons in Boston, making him the second-longest tenured manager in Red Sox history behind only Joe Cronin's 13-year tenure. In six years at the helm in Boston, Cora has already amassed 494 wins, fourth-most in franchise history.\n\n'\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job; that respect has only grown these last several months,\" Breslow said in a statement. \"He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching first-hand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future. I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow.\"\n\nCora managed the club to last-place finishes in 2022 and 2023. What he's done in 2024 with an injury-riddled roster that lost starters Lucas Giolito and Garrett Whitlock as well as shortstop Trevor Story early in the year, has put him in contention for the American League manager of the year award.\n\nAll season, Cora has been asked about returning to Boston, but he's demurred. As recently as three weeks ago, he said he would not engage in contract talks mid-year.\n\n\"We decided before the season that we're not going to talk about my contract,\" Cora said on July 9. \"My contract situation will be talked (about) after the last out, hopefully, of the World Series.\"\n\nBut over the last few weeks, the conversations picked up and an offer was made that Cora couldn't refuse.\n\n\"Sometimes I can put on an act for you guys and sometimes I was actually telling the truth,\" Cora said of the contract talks. \"We've been talking for a few weeks here, the relationship between me and Craig has grown the last six, seven months, obviously the relationship I have with ownership and (Red Sox CEO) Sam (Kennedy) is very important. And at the end of the day, like I said, there are probably a lot of (managerial jobs) that are going to open up at the end of the season and some of them may be very inconvenient for the family. I promise you this decision was more based on the comfort of my family than actually my professional career.\"\n\nThe timing of the deal may have seemed odd. The extension news came in the midst of one of the worst road trips of the season (1-5) on the day of a 13-run defeat, the worst loss of the season, to one of the league's worst teams in the Colorado Rockies. But the timing is key in another sense, too. It stands to reason that Cora would not have agreed to a long-term deal if he wasn't convinced the organization was willing to improve the club. With the deadline looming, it seems like a good indicator Cora's contract is the first major move of Boston's trade season.\n\nThis has long been Cora's team and now it figures to be for at least three more years. It's been hard to know where ownership stands on anything the last several years, except for the manager.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jen_mccaffrey@nytimes.com", "name": "Jen McCaffrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Bloom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chaim Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Whitlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Story", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Giolito", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Giolito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The skipper in March also said he wasn't expecting extension talks to occur amid the season, which led many to believe Cora was setting the stage for an exit.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the Red Sox shocked the baseball world when they finalized a three-year extension for Cora. After signing on the dotted line, the 48-year-old revealed the delay in negotiations wasn't out of a desire to keep his career options open.\n\n\"I promise you, this decision was more based on the comfort of my family than my professional career,\" Cora told reporters, per ESPN.\n\nSecurity for his family was one of the priorities Cora presented to the Red Sox before the sides struck their deal.

Heyman says the deal is being finalized now.\n\n1:50pm: The Red Sox and manager Alex Cora have recently engaged in talks about a contract extension, per Jeff Passan and Buster Olney of ESPN, as relayed by Passan on X. Passan says there is momentum towards a deal with a multi-year deal possible. In a subsequent tweet, he adds that the sides have talked about a three-year pact. Olney tweets that the discussed deals would pay Cora in the range of $21.75MM over those three years.\n\nCora, 48, has been the subject of speculation for a while since he is in the final year of his current contract. The club finished last in the American League East in both 2022 and 2023, which led the franchise to fire chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom. Cora stayed on with Craig Breslow replacing Bloom, but it wasn't clear if Cora would stay beyond the current season.\n\nSome had speculated that Cora might look to pivot to a front office role, something he has openly expressed an interest in. Others wondered if he might follow the path of Craig Counsell, who surprised many by becoming a free agent and signing with the Cubs for $40MM over five years, changing the landscape of salary expectations for high-profile managers.\n\nAfter those aforementioned last-place finishes, the Sox went on to have a fairly modest offseason. Their most notable deal in the winter was signing Lucas Giolito to a two-year deal, but they also traded away Chris Sale and then Giolito required season-ending surgery, seemingly leaving the club worse than where they were before.\n\nExpectations were therefore fairly low but the Sox have easily surpassed them. Thanks largely to breakouts from incumbent players like Tanner Houck, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu, Kutter Crawford and others, the Sox are 54-46, putting them just one game back of a playoff spot.\n\nAs recently as last month, Cora told reporters that he and the club had no plans to discuss a midseason extension, but it appears that has now changed. Perhaps that's due to the club performing better than expected or simply because Cora and Breslow have now had a few months to work together and become comfortable with one another.\n\nThe franchise has shown loyalty to Cora before. He managed the club in 2018 and 2019, winning the World Series in the first of those years, but he missed the 2020 season after being suspended by Major League Baseball. Cora was the bench coach for the Astros in 2017 and received that punishment for his role in their infamous sign-stealing operation. Ron Roenicke served as the bench boss in Boston that year but Cora was re-hired after his suspension was served, a two-year deal with club options for 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Sox then went on a surprise playoff run 2021, despite finishing in last in the East the year prior. On the heels of that strong season, the Sox preemptively exercised both of their club options, keeping Cora in the dugout through 2024. That contract is now nearing its completion but it sounds as though there's a good chance of a new deal getting done to keep him in Boston.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darragh_mcdonald@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Darragh McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Giolito", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Giolito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Bloom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chaim Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Abreu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Abreu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutter_Crawford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kutter Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarren_Duran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarren Duran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Houck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Houck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Roenicke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Roenicke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2024/07/Alex_Cora_Red_Sox-200x300.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

While the players deserve credit for going out and performing at a high level, manager Alex Cora also deserves his due praise for helping turn a team that was widely expected to finish at the bottom of their division into a playoff contender.\n\nConsidering the fact that he's in the final year of his contract, questions about Cora's future with the team have been swirling throughout the season. And while he had previously been murky about his standing with the team, it appears as if the two sides have in fact agreed to a new contract extension, with the final terms coming in at over $7 million per season for three years.\n\nVia Jon Heyman:\n\n\"Alex Cora and the Red Sox are in agreement at $7M-plus per year over 3 years. Just finalizing the deal now.\"\n\nRed Sox secure Alex Cora's future with the team\n\nPrior to this deal getting finalized from out of nowhere, it was fair to wonder whether Cora would stay in Boston past this season. He had been tight-lipped about a potential extension, and he hasn't appeared to be all that pleased with ownership's lack of financial commitment to building the roster. Rumors swirled that he could leave for another team over the offseason, and given the team's expectations entering the year, many fans assumed he was heading for the exit door after the 2024 campaign.\n\nInstead, the team has been relatively successful this year, and that may have just convinced Cora to stick around and continue to help them out. This deal came to fruition pretty quickly, but there's no doubt that this was something that Boston and their fans had been hoping to see happen given how successful Cora's stint with the team has been\n\nThis is a huge win for the Sox, as Cora has established himself as one of the best managers in all of baseball during his time in Boston. While his involvement in the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal is obviously a black mark on his legacy, he's managed to overcome that and find his way with the Red Sox. And now that he's put pen to paper, he's going to try to lead his team back to the top of the mountain just like he did back in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Boston-Alex-Cora-contract-extension-talks-heating-up.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Currently in his sixth season as manager, he has recorded a 494-417 (.542) record. His 494 wins rank fourth in franchise history, while his .542 winning percentage ranks fourth among the 13 individuals to manage at least 500 games with the Red Sox. He is one of only six individuals to manage at least six seasons with the Red Sox, joining Joe Cronin (13), Terry Francona (eight), Mike Higgins (eight), Bill Carrigan (seven), and Jimmy Collins (six).\n\nNamed the 47 manager in Red Sox history on October 22, 2017, Cora in 2018 led Boston to a franchise-record 108 regular-season wins, an American League East title, an 11-3 record in the Postseason, and a World Series championship. After a 2019 season that featured an 84-78 record, the club and Cora mutually parted ways on January 14, 2020. On November 6, 2020, the Red Sox and Cora agreed to a two-year contract through the 2022 season with a two-year club option for the 2023 and 2024 seasons, an option the club exercised on November 22, 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Cora led the Red Sox to a 92-70 record in the regular season, including a Major League-best 47 come-from-behind wins. Boston advanced to the American League Championship Series, after defeating the New York Yankees in the AL Wild Card Game and the Tampa Bay Rays in the AL Division Series. Following consecutive 78-84 seasons in 2022 and 2023, the Red Sox went 54-47 in their first 101 games of 2024, recording the majors' best record from May 19-July 14 (31-18, .633).\n\nCora has led the Red Sox to a 17-8 Postseason record, including 5-0 in potential series-clinching games. He is one of only six managers to lead the Red Sox to multiple Postseason appearances, joining Bill Carrigan (1915-16), Joe Morgan (1988, '90), Jimy Williams (1998-99), Terry Francona (2004-05, '07-09), and John Farrell (2013, '16-17).\n\nDuring his playing career with the Red Sox (2005-08), Cora batted .252 (176-for-698) in 301 games, splitting time primarily between second base and shortstop. He was part of Boston's Division Series roster in 2005 and appeared in four games during the club's 2007 World Series title run, including two games in the Championship Series and two in the Fall Classic. He also served as the Red Sox' starting shortstop in three games during the 2008 Postseason.\n\nCora resides in Caguas and has four children: Jeriel, Camila, Xander, and Isander.

After all, Cora has a World Series win on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Counsell did not. When pressed in spring training, Cora wouldn't even commit to wanting to return to the Red Sox dugout in 2025.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWHO: New York Yankees (Cortes 4-9) at Boston Red Sox (Bello 10-5)\n\nWHEN: 7:10 p.m. Friday\n\nTELEVISION: NESN\n\nWas that strategic or defiant?\n\nAt the same time, Craig Breslow, new to the position of chief baseball officer last fall, felt little urgency to address Cora's managerial future.\n\n\"Those conversations will take place between Alex and me when the time is right,\" said Breslow at last November's GM Meetings. \"He is preparing for the 2024 season; I'm preparing for a 2024 season. Beyond that, I don't think it makes a ton of sense to speak to.\"\n\nYet somehow, in recent days and weeks, the two came together on an extension that will make Cora the game's second-highest paid manager behind Counsell -- a three-year, $21.75 million deal that was announced Wednesday, minutes after the Sox absorbed their worst loss of the season in Denver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat changed?\n\nSlowly, Breslow and Cora have built a relationship in the last seven or eight months. It began over the winter during the team's roster construction, continued in the more relaxed atmosphere of spring training, and flourished further as the season progressed.\n\nThere was no way to speed up the learning curve that needed to be navigated. Cora needed to know that his input would not only be solicited, but valued when it came to personnel. Breslow, for his part, needed time to learn how to best communicate with Cora, and be convinced that he and the manager could work together.\n\nCould Cora implement Breslow's vision? Were the two on the same page philosophically?\n\nThe more Breslow watched, the more he gained fresh respect for Cora's ability to relate to players and earn their trust. Breslow saw the buy-in that Cora was getting from the players, many of whom spoke far more positively on the team's prospects for 2024 than seemed warranted. From his first address to the full squad in February, when Cora told his players that they were being underestimated, through a rough April that saw the team revert back to some issues from a year ago, Cora didn't waver in his positive approach.\n\nCora showed patience with the likes of Ceddanne Rafaela and David Hamilton, both of whom struggled mightily in the opening weeks of the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when devastating injuries hit the club -- to Lucas Giolito in spring training, and later, to Trevor Story in the first week of the regular season -- Cora was resolute. He had a message for the players, which he repeated to the media: He made it clear that while the loss of such key players was, indeed, devastating, the team couldn't afford to wallow in self-pity. By tackling the issue head-on, Cora made sure that wouldn't be the case.\n\nHe also saw how Cora was quick to adapt to the new pitching program, which Breslow, with the help of pitching coach Andrew Bailey and director of pitching Justin Willard, designed.\n\nUnder the program, Tanner Houck has grown into an All-Star and a legitimate front-of-the-rotation starter. Not far behind is Kutter Crawford, who has become both more durable and more dominant.\n\nFinally, Breslow watched Cora oversee the continued improvement and maturation of Rafaela, Hamilton, and Jarren Duran.\n\nIt's an accepted fact of modern baseball that some player development now takes place at the big league level. Players get to the majors faster than ever, but often without being finished products. Additionally, thanks to analytics and pitching labs, the quality of pitching is often far better in the big leagues when compared to Triple-A. Even the most talented prospects are going to meet with some failure, and with his strong communication skills and teaching ability, Cora is better equipped than most to smooth the transition.\n\nEven as ownership and upper management vow that they will again be willing to spend big on necessary free agents when the times comes, it's clear that much of the organization's future will rely on contributions from homegrown players: not just those who've already begun their big league careers (Houck, Crawford, Duran, Rafaela, Brayan Bello), but also, those who've yet to arrive (Marcelo Mayer, Kyle Teel, Roman Anthony, Kristian Campbell, Braden Montgomery).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCora offers steadiness, direction and continuity.\n\nAs for the manager, he got what he sought, too.\n\nFirst, he saw an executive with whom he could work and who welcomed his thoughts. It didn't hurt that the on-field improvement shown by the team this year will likely result in a more aggressive approach to spending -- starting this winter. After experiencing back-to-back last-place finishes in 2022 and 2023, Cora needed to know he wouldn't be trapped in a cycle of low-payroll losing seasons.\n\nSecondly, he got the payday he believed he deserved. Cora has made it known that he has little interest in managing forever, and this year represented his best case to cash in. His new contract doesn't match Counsell's in length, but it's close when it comes to average annual salary: Counsell will make $750,000 more annually, but he had to go through the uncertainty of free agency to find it.\n\nIn the process, Counsell, who has deep Wisconsin roots, had to move his family to achieve his industry-leading contract. Cora does not. His daughter has a year remaining at Boston College, and both his partner, Angelica, and their twin grade-school sons enjoy Boston. Now, they get to remain here.\n\nCora, then, got the best of both worlds: he tripled his salary, while staying in a place where he and his family were already comfortable.\n\nCopy the Story Link

turnaround.\n\nCora has been the Red Sox manager since 2018, winning the World Series after a 108-win season in his first year and going 84-78 in 2019.\n\nHe was suspended by Major League Baseball for the 2020 season for his involvement in the Astros' sign-stealing scandal and later re-hired by Boston ahead of the 2021 season, when the team reached the ALCS after going 92-70 in the regular season.\n\nHad he entered the open market, Cora would have been one of the most sought-after managers available, with the Yankees recently rumored as a potential destination depending on Aaron Boone's future.\n\nCora's deal follows the record-setting five-year, $40 million contract the Cubs gave former Brewers manager Craig Counsell last offseason, which reset the market for big league managers.",

That ran counter to the desires of team brass, which had identified locking up Cora and not letting him hit free agency as a major, pressing priority that needed to be taken care of as soon as possible.\n\n\"That position was not in the best interest of the Boston Red Sox,\" laughed team president Sam Kennedy in a conversation with MassLive on Thursday. \"We fully respected Alex's position but Bres went to him and said, 'Listen, can we re-visit this? We have so many priorities we're going to have in the offseason and we want to try to get this done and get it done quietly and between the two of us.' They were able to work it out, which was great.\"\n\nWork it out they did. On Wednesday, the Red Sox officially announced they had signed Cora to a three-year deal that is reportedly in the range of $21.75 million ($7.25 million annually). The deal, which makes Cora the second highest-paid manager in baseball behind the Cubs' Craig Counsell, came as a shock to many in baseball who believed Cora had his eye on landing elsewhere in free agency this fall. When push came to shove, the Red Sox stepped up and made a financially competitive offer to ensure their highly regarded manager was in Boston to stay.\n\n\"(The value of the commitment) speaks to what Alex means to us and what he means to the Red Sox organization,\" Kennedy said. \"Yes, he's our manager but he's so much more than that. He rightly has become the face of the franchise in so many ways. He just cares so much. He connects with our fans in the most authentic way. Equally as important, he connects with our players. He connects with every member of the front office and that's just a huge testament to him.\n\n\"He's an all-in kind of guy. We wanted to express the all-in nature of our feelings for him. That was only possible once he and Bres had time to work together and Bres made the decision that this was indeed the guy he wanted for the long-term. We couldn't be happier that it worked out.\"\n\nWhile going through the process that led to Breslow's hiring in October, Kennedy made clear to his new chief baseball officer -- and the other candidates that interviewed for the position -- that Cora would remain as manager for 2024 and that the new baseball operations chief would have the final say on his future beyond that point. All parties entered the season comfortable with Cora's lame-duck status knowing that the relationship between Cora and his new boss (eventually, Breslow) would develop, positively or negatively, in an organic manner. Because tensions between Cora and Breslow's predecessor, Chaim Bloom, played a part in Bloom's firing, that was no sure thing. But Cora and Breslow, who briefly played together in Boston in 2006, have gotten off on the right foot.\n\n\"We created an awkward dynamic when we made the change,\" Kennedy said. \"We were committed to that. We made it clear to Alex how that was our plan. We made that clear to the candidates who were interviewing, how that was our plan. We held to that. I had a strong feeling from the beginning that the working relationship with Bres and AC would be a good one, just given the underlying relationship they had from their playing days and being a part of the Red Sox. But we really needed to stay out of it and let those two either develop the type of relationship working together where things were going to work out long-term or not.\"\n\nIn that vein, Kennedy -- along with principal owner John Henry and chairman Tom Werner -- gave Breslow the ultimate decision on the future of the managerial position. Breslow methodically let things play out and watched Cora lead the Red Sox to a strong first half before making an approach to ownership a couple weeks ago, according to Kennedy.\n\n\"We really needed to let things just develop on their own through the course of last offseason, spring training and the first half of this season,\" Kennedy said. \"And it was great when Bres came to us and said, 'Look, I've had enough time to evaluate. Given the past history, I feel really good about this and want to try to make something work.'\n\nKennedy reiterated that ownership didn't push Breslow to get a deal done with Cora despite the Henry-led group being known fans of the manager, having hired him twice before (2017, 2020).\n\n\"We were involved to the extent where we offered our opinions and our thoughts, and really, support, in the end, given what it took from a contractual perspective,\" Kennedy said. \"Bres worked with us on the financial parameters of the contract and the working relationship between him and AC. We supported his efforts. He came to us along the way, throughout the process, but it was a process he conducted on his own. We were there when he needed us in terms of the financial resources and making sure everybody was on board.\"\n\nKennedy acknowledged future competitiveness was a topic of conversation between Cora and the club during negotiations but said Cora's contract does not include any sort of stipulations or language involving competitiveness or payroll -- \"Not at all. I'm glad I could dispel that,\" Kennedy said -- that would allow him to leave if the club didn't contend during the course of the deal.\n\n\"He did make that (an interest in winning) clear to Bres along the way and that commitment was reciprocated by us and by Craig,\" Kennedy said. \"We're going to continue to do everything in our power to get back to October baseball ... We're all in this together and the commitment has never wavered in terms of trying to build a sustainable winner.\"\n\nNext on Kennedy's agenda is the July 30 trade deadline, which will provide the best chance for the 54-47 Red Sox to improve their roster for the stretch run. One day after Breslow told The Boston Globe that the team planned on buying, Kennedy reiterated those plans while somewhat tempering expectations about what to expect in the next four days.\n\n\"We're obviously looking to try to improve where we can,\" he said. \"You never want to publicly make bold proclamations or assurances because I just don't know how this market's going to develop. But we stand behind Bres and his comments.

However, he ultimately decided staying in Boston was best for him and his family.\n\nHe opened up about his decision after Wednesday's series finale vs. the Colorado Rockies.\n\n\"We're very happy,\" Cora told reporters. \"What this organization means to us is the world. They trusted me from day one. I still remember them meeting in the palace in New York with Dave (Dombrowski) and the group. They doubled down on me in '21 after everything that happened from '17. We've been talking for a little bit here, and talking to (partner) Angelica and (daughter) Camila, this is home for us.\n\n\"People can speculate, whatever. And there were a lot of conversations in the offseason and this season that this might happen or he wants to get paid, whatever. I just want to be happy and comfortable. The boys are seven, Camila's gonna graduate from college next year, Angelica loves the city. The support system that we have in the city and from people back home, it's very easy. We put everything on the scale and we decided that this is a great opportunity for us to keep growing as a family. Obviously, to keep growing as a manager.\n\n\"The baseball part of it, I feel very comfortable that where we're at right now and where we're going is what I want. I've been talking to Craig (Breslow) for a little bit here and there were two things that I wanted. I want to win and I want security for my family, and we have accomplished both.\"\n\nCora led the Red Sox to a World Series title in 2018, his first season as manager. He was fired prior to the 2020 season as a result of his involvement in the Houston Astros' 2017 sign-stealing scandal. The club re-hired him ahead of the 2021 campaign.\n\nWith Cora leading the charge, Boston made a surprising trip to the ALCS in 2021 but followed with last-place seasons in 2022 and 2023.

The report comes after ESPN's Jeff Passan and Buster Olney reported the two sides were in negotiations and that there was \"momentum toward a deal.\"\n\nCora wasn't signed beyond the current season, and he declined to go into detail about his future when asked in May.\n\n\"Out of respect to the organization and the players, and the season, we're not going to talk about contracts,\" he told reporters. \"We'll play it out and then whatever is decided is decided.\"\n\nPerhaps ownership wanted to see how the team performed in 2024 on the heels of back-to-back 78-84 campaigns before it recommitted to Cora. If that were the case, then the Red Sox's 54-46 record has provided a compelling reason for him to stay.\n\nBoston trails the first-place Baltimore Orioles by six games in the American League East but is just one game off the final wild-card spot. That's not bad considering the organization didn't go \"full throttle\" this past offseason.\n\nCompounding matters, two of the Red Sox's veteran additions have yet to even suit up. Starting pitcher Lucas Giolito had elbow surgery that will probably keep him out all season, while three-time All-Star reliever Liam Hendriks was recovering from Tommy John surgery when he signed.\n\n\"Unless Rafael Devers or Triston Casas secretly learned how to pitch over the winter, that's about it for the club's playoff chances,\" The Ringer's Zach Kram wrote in March.\n\nInstead, postseason baseball is a very real possibility in Boston. FanGraphs gives the team 40.7 percent odds of getting there.\n\nThe Red Sox won 108 games and claimed a World Series title with Cora in 2018 and then advanced to the ALCS in 2021, giving him plenty of equity with ownership already.

Alex Cora just got an absolutely huge contract from the Craig Breslow-led organization as a sign of this.\n\nThe Red Sox will have Alex Cora as their manager up until the 2027 season because of this contract. He is estimated to earn around $7 million per year which will make his total contract valuation roughly $21 million. It was very clear that he wanted to bring the squad back to their winning ways after their mid-season turnaround. He also feels the most comfortable working for John W. Henry and Craig Breslow, via Ian Browne of the MLB.\n\n\"Today is about the Cora-Feliciano family. We love Boston and are very comfortable here. The Red Sox gave us a chance back in 2017 and doubled down on us prior to the 2021 season, and I'm happy to say our future is here as well. I'd like to thank John Henry, Tom Werner, Mike Gordon, Sam Kennedy, and Craig Breslow for their confidence in me. I'm excited about not only where we are as an organization, but also where we are going,\" the Red Sox manager declared.\n\nUnder Cora, the Red Sox have found their new core of stars for the future. Jarren Duran and Tanner Houck have both developed into All-Stars. Some rotational issues can still be seen in the Red Sox system. The evidence of this was their most recent 20-7 loss against the Rockies. However, this continued growth is clearly better than having another hopeless season of not winning a lot of games in the competitive AL East.\n\nRed Sox happy to have Alex Cora for the long-haul\n\n54 wins after losing to the Rockies and before the MLB Trade Deadline is not much but it is a lot of progress for the Red Sox. Clearly, Breslow knows that Cora has a lot more to give in terms of training up-and-coming talent. He even outlined how great the feeling was after they extended their manager for another three seasons.\n\n\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job. That respect has only grown these last several months. He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching firsthand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future. I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow. I congratulate him, Angelica, and their family,\" the former Red Sox pitcher turned front office executive said.\n\nThere is still a lot of work that the Red Sox need to do in order to go back to contending for a World Series.

After all, Cora has a World Series win on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, while Counsell did not. When pressed in spring training, Cora wouldn't even commit to wanting to return to the Red Sox dugout in 2025.\n\nWas that strategic or defiant?\n\nAt the same time, Craig Breslow, new to the position of chief baseball officer last fall, felt little urgency to address Cora's managerial future.\n\n\"Those conversations will take place between Alex and me when the time is right,\" said Breslow at last November's GM Meetings. \"He is preparing for the 2024 season; I'm preparing for a 2024 season. Beyond that, I don't think it makes a ton of sense to speak to.\"\n\nYet somehow, in recent days and weeks, the two came together on an extension that will make Cora the game's second-highest paid manager behind Counsell -- a three-year, $21.75 million deal that was announced Wednesday, minutes after the Sox absorbed their worst loss of the season in Denver.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nSlowly, Breslow and Cora have built a relationship in the last seven or eight months. It began over the winter during the team's roster construction, continued in the more relaxed atmosphere of spring training, and flourished further as the season progressed.\n\nThere was no way to speed up the learning curve that needed to be navigated. Cora needed to know that his input would not only be solicited, but valued when it came to personnel. Breslow, for his part, needed time to learn how to best communicate with Cora, and be convinced that he and the manager could work together.\n\nCould Cora implement Breslow's vision? Were the two on the same page philosophically?\n\nThe more Breslow watched, the more he gained fresh respect for Cora's ability to relate to players and earn their trust. Breslow saw the buy-in that Cora was getting from the players, many of whom spoke far more positively on the team's prospects for 2024 than seemed warranted. From his first address to the full squad in February, when Cora told his players that they were being underestimated, through a rough April that saw the team revert back to some issues from a year ago, Cora didn't waver in his positive approach.\n\nCora showed patience with the likes of Ceddanne Rafaela and David Hamilton, both of whom struggled mightily in the opening weeks of the season.\n\nAnd when devastating injuries hit the club -- to Lucas Giolito in spring training, and later, to Trevor Story in the first week of the regular season -- Cora was resolute. He had a message for the players, which he repeated to the media: He made it clear that while the loss of such key players was, indeed, devastating, the team couldn't afford to wallow in self-pity. By tackling the issue head-on, Cora made sure that wouldn't be the case.\n\nHe also saw how Cora was quick to adapt to the new pitching program, which Breslow, with the help of pitching coach Andrew Bailey and director of pitching Justin Willard, designed.\n\nUnder the program, Tanner Houck has grown into an All-Star and a legitimate front-of-the-rotation starter. Not far behind is Kutter Crawford, who has become both more durable and more dominant.\n\nFinally, Breslow watched Cora oversee the continued improvement and maturation of Rafaela, David Hamilton, and Jarren Duran.\n\nIt's an accepted fact of modern baseball that some player development now takes place at the big league level. Players get to the majors faster than ever, but often without being finished products. Additionally, thanks to analytics and pitching labs, the quality of pitching is often far better in the big leagues when compared to Triple A. Even the most talented prospects are going to meet with some failure, and with his strong communication skills and teaching ability, Cora is better equipped than most to smooth the transition.\n\nEven as ownership and upper management vow that they will again be willing to spend big on necessary free agents when the times comes, it's clear that much of the organization's future will rely on contributions from homegrown players: not just those who've already begun their big league careers (Houck, Crawford, Duran, Rafaela, Brayan Bello), but also, those who've yet to arrive (Marcelo Mayer, Kyle Teel, Roman Anthony, Kristian Campbell, Braden Montgomery).\n\nCora offers steadiness, direction and continuity.\n\nAs for the manager, he got what he sought, too.\n\nFirst, he saw an executive with whom he could work and who welcomed his thoughts. It didn't hurt that the on-field improvement shown by the team this year will likely result in a more aggressive approach to spending -- starting this winter. After experiencing back-to-back last-place finishes in 2022 and 2023, Cora needed to know he wouldn't be trapped in a cycle of low-payroll losing seasons.\n\nSecondly, he got the payday he believed he deserved. Cora has made it known that he has little interest in managing forever, and this year represented his best case to cash in. His new contract doesn't match Craig Counsell's in length, but it's close when it comes to average annual salary: Counsell will make $750,000 more annually, but he had to go through the uncertainty of free agency to find it.\n\nIn the process, Counsell, who has deep Wisconsin roots, had to move his family to achieve his industry-leading contract. Cora does not. His daughter has a year remaining at Boston College, and both his partner Angelica and their twin grade-school sons enjoy Boston. Now, they get to remain here.\n\nCora, then, got the best of both worlds: he tripled his salary, while staying in a place where he and his family were already comfortable.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Houck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Houck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Story", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Giolito", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Giolito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brayan_Bello", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brayan Bello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutter_Crawford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kutter Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarren_Duran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarren Duran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/NO53R2JIJBCB5GWR2RTEXIU52I.jpg?auth=9d90e16532ce5a4945d50f12671887cfe687ecb98991c0892d53b2757b561348&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

These people trusted me. I'm glad and I'm a grateful kid from Caguas, Puerto Rico, and here I am.\"\n\nIt's been a rough three-year stretch for Cora and the organization. In 2021, the Red Sox showed an encouraging sign by clinching a wild-card spot, eliminating the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays before falling short in the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros. The patience of the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season paid off, Cora's managerial impact returned to its rightful place at Fenway Park's helm and Boston was back in contention. However, the Red Sox lost their grip, slipping to dead-last in the American League East in 2022 and 2023, resulting in the franchise switching its leadership by parting ways with Chaim Bloom and naming Breslow as the team's chief baseball officer this past offseason.\n\nBoston's flip-of-the-switch (clearly) needed to span beyond the front office and trickle its way into the locker room, but the pendulum of luck didn't swing in favor of the Red Sox. Starting pitcher Lucas Gioltio, who's among the most durable arms in MLB, suffered a season-ending right elbow injury during spring training. Garrett Whitlock, another rotational righty, suffered the same fate -- a right ulnar collateral ligament injury -- which left Cora and the coaching staff to, once again, get creative and keep the ship afloat despite the unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe Red Sox had a grocery list of doubters entering the season, yet Cora's trust in the young core has paid dividends. Ceddanne Rafaela is a legitimate Rookie of the Year candidate, Jarren Duran is an electric All-Star and Tanner Houck is among the most dominant right-handed arms in baseball -- and it's all translating to the standings. Boston's in the mix of teams with a shot at knocking on the contention door in October, and a critical part of it is Cora, who'll stick around through the 2027 season.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caguas,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caguas, Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caguas, Puerto Rico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Bloom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chaim Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Houck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Houck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/Alex-Cora-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

That will make Cora the second-highest paid manager in baseball behind the Cubs' Craig Counsell, who is earning $8 million in the first year of a five-year, $40 million deal he signed last fall. In 2025, Cora will receive a raise of $4.5 million; he's making $2.75 million in 2024.\n\nThe news shocked many in baseball circles. Cora's current contract expires after the season and he previously said -- quite adamantly, on numerous occasions -- that he was not willing to discuss a contract during the season. It was thought Cora wanted to test managerial free agency, as Counsell did last year, with big-market clubs like the Yankees, Phillies and Dodgers potentially looming if any of those jobs were to come open. In the end, Cora decided it was best for him and his family to re-up in Boston, where he has managed for six seasons over two stints separated by a year-long suspension in 2020.\n\n\"This is home for us,\" Cora said (via NESN's postgame show). \"People can speculate or whatever. There were a lot of conversations in the offseason and during the season that this might happen or, 'He wants to get paid' or whatever. I just want to be happy and comfortable.\n\n\"We put everything on the scale and we decided that this is a great opportunity for us to keep growing as a family and to keep growing as a manager. Obviously, the baseball part of it, I feel very comfortable with where we're at right now and where we're going is what I want. I've been talking to Craig for a little bit here and there were two things I wanted. I wanted to win and I wanted security for my family. We have accomplished both.\"\n\nChief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Denver on Tuesday night to close the deal with Cora.\n\n\"I had a tremendous amount of respect for Alex long before I took this job; that respect has only grown these last several months,\" said Breslow. \"He is an incredible people connector, something I have enjoyed watching firsthand. He has embraced Boston's passionate fans and we share a desire to win as much as they do, both in 2024 and in the future. I'm happy to be able to extend our commitment to Alex, and I look forward to our partnership continuing to grow. I congratulate him, Angelica, and their family.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/NK5FW2G67NEPBFYNXR6PPRDPSQ.jpg?auth=04e77009c64599d46f591745276090a58be6a80dbdafa851ba5a71e5becdda94&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Why? He never gave much of an explanation, save for tossing the \"distraction\" tag on in-season contract chatter a few times. It always felt like there was something missing to that, though, with many believing potential openings in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York might be of interest to the 48-year old.\n\nThe Phillies, Dodgers and Yankees will instead be stuck with their underperforming skippers, as Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow helped change Cora's mind and pushed things across the finish line by taking a flight to Colorado and finalizing the deal in person.\n\n\"I've been talking to Craig for a little bit,\" Cora told reporters, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage Wednesday. \"There were two things that I wanted: I want to win and I want security for my family, and we have accomplished both. ... These people trusted me. I'm glad and I'm a grateful kid from Caguas, Puerto Rico, and here I am.\"\n\nWhy was Breslow so focused on getting the extension done? Why did Cora change his mind? What comes next?\n\nOne answer will do for all of those questions. The Red Sox are buying.\n\n\"At some point, we need to stop with the stupid analogies and put the turn signal on,\" Breslow told reporters in Colorado, per The Boston Globe. \"We've played really good baseball for the last few months. We've put ourselves in this position where we're going to look to improve the team. That's where we would want to be.\n\n\"I think everybody who takes this job does so with an eye on being in a place where not only can you add to the team but it's the right decision. We obviously have to be mindful of the future. In a perfect world, we can improve our 2024 team and also our '25 and beyond. That's my job. But I think as things stand right now, we're looking for ways to improve the club.\"\n\nBoston obviously wasn't playing its best baseball at the time of the deal, but what it did before the All-Star break clearly has the club in contention for an American League Wild Card spot -- far ahead of where many thought they'd be this season.\n\nCora can take a large chunk of the credit for that, and with the timing of when the deal ultimately got done, it can be presumed the two sides re-engaged during the Midsummer Classic about lengthening their partnership.\n\nThe Red Sox were never going to push any chips to the middle of the table without knowing who would lead their club into the future. Breslow knew that, and can now move freely with an eye on improving the current team as well as the future before the clock strikes 6 p.m. ET on July 30. It doesn't just stop at the end of July, either. Breslow can now enter the offseason with a relatively clean plate, and while the Red Sox will have to prove they're once again willing to spend, his options are wide open on paper.\n\nCora is here to stay, meaning he'll have a hand in developing Marcelo Mayer, Roman Anthony and Kyle Teel -- just as he has with guys like Jarren Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela and Connor Wong.

I'm not ruling out that the Red Sox are not going to employ Alex Cora next year. We can look at a number of teams that could have openings if things don't go the way they want them to, and I'm talking about big teams. The Dodgers are one, the Yankees are another, and the Cardinals are a third, and there are more as well.\n\n\"It's going to be really interesting to see what Alex Cora decides. He's talked a lot about wanting to be with his family and his kids. Could he take a year off? Yeah, I think he could take a year off, or maybe even move to a front office role.\n\n\"But he's going to be this year's Craig Counsell, it certainly seems that way. ... Cora will be out there, he's going to be an interesting name. If one of those big teams, the Dodgers or Yankees, somehow flames out in the playoffs, could I see changes taking place? Yes I could.\"\n\nCora has managed the Red Sox for six seasons now, posting a .543 winning percentage with a World Series title in 2018. Since he was speculated as a potential candidate to be the next Dodgers manager, Cora and the Red Sox agreed to a three-year contract extension.\n\nWhile the Red Sox have played well under his leadership, Cora was also part of the Houston Astros' 2017 sign-stealing scandal, which could have made him a questionable fit for Dodgers manager.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers have not made it past the NL Division Series in back-to-back years, which led to some calls for the team to fire Roberts after they were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nExpectations for the Dodgers are higher than ever after they spent more than $1 billion this past offseason on the likes of Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nRoberts has one year remaining on the contract extension he signed before the 2022 season, putting him in position to be a lame-duck manager next year.\n\nEven with some uncertainty looming, Roberts said he is currently focused on the 2024 season but hopes to continue managing the Dodgers for many years to come.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_borelli@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Borelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Division Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Alex-Cora-Dave-Roberts-2018-World-Series.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Even though the Red Sox have logged back-to-back last-place finishes, Cora's kept the team's young core competitive.

We're sitting at home, we're watching this season play out. A season where everyone, myself included, I'm guilty, came in saying, 'Well, I'm not expecting much from the Red Sox this season. ...

It's wide open.\"\n\nNext Tuesday's 6 p.m. ET MLB trade deadline could determine what to expect for the remainder of the season from the Red Sox.

They've also won six out of seven division titles during this span, with their only second place finish coming during the COVID-shortened 2020 season.\n\nThat's why it was so shocking to see this group struggle for the majority of this year.\n\nThey've stabilized things and are now back at the top of the AL West, but for a long time many people were wondering if they would have to sell off some of their assets at the trade deadline if they were still under .500.\n\nBecause of that, a lot of criticism was being placed on first-time manager Joe Espada.\n\nIt's never easy to take over for a legend, but not only did he have to follow Dusty Baker who won a World Series with this franchise, he also had to follow AJ Hinch who won before Baker took over for him.\n\nWhen Houston was struggling with largely the same players on the team, Espada was the scapegoat.\n\nIt even got to the point where some people in the baseball world were suggest the Astros might move on from him after one season and turn to their former bench coach Alex Cora to come in and take over the job when his contract with the Boston Red Sox expired at the end of this year.\n\nCora was with Houston when they won the World Series in 2017, leaving to become manager of the Red Sox in 2018, but it was revealed he was a major part of the cheating scandal that rocked this franchise, so bringing him back would have felt a bit strange.\n\nThe Astros wouldn't have been able to pursue their former bench coach even if they wanted to, though.\n\nBuster Olney of ESPN reported that Boston and Cora have agreed on a three-year extension that will pay him $21.75 million. This will make him the second-highest paid manager in the MLB behind Craig Counsell of the Chicago Cubs who signed a $40 million deal this past offseason.\n\nHouston is likely very happy with Espada, so this news didn't affect them one bit.\n\nHe'll attempt to keep his team heading in the right direction as he pursues his first AL West crown that will secure their fourth in a row.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Baker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Baker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Espada", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Espada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Olney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buster Olney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7937,h_4464,x_0,y_18/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_astros/01j3kw8j7s3w1vr98mms.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760697", "eventUri": "eng-9760697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

He just cares so much. He connects with our fans in the most authentic way. Equally as important, he connects with our players. He connects with every member of the front office and that's a huge testament to him.\"\n\nCora's initial contract was set to expire at the end of 2024, which could've allowed the 48-year-old to explore the open market. And considering the job he's done from the helm working with Boston's young core to avoid sinking in the American League East standings, it's likely Cora's phone would've been buzzing had he entertained free agency. There aren't many MLB skippers capable of tapping into a young up-and-coming roster's strengths, like Cora, while also positioning the franchise to buy before the trade deadline with a legitimate chance at clinching a playoff berth.\n\nUnder Cora's leadership, the Red Sox have witnessed Jarren Duran go from being left off the 2023 Opening Day roster to winning the All-Star Game MVP a few weeks ago in Texas. Boston's watched Tanner Houck blossom as the unofficial rotation's Ace, putting together a Cy Young-worthy season. Aside from the post-Midsummer Classic (1-5) hiccup, which can be attributed to the instability of injuries haunting the rotation, lineup and infield, the Red Sox have done a tremendous job staying competitive through their ups and downs -- due in large part to the patience and trust Cora's exhibited from the get-go.\n\n\"I had a strong feeling from the beginning that the working relationship with (Craig Breslow) and AC would be a good one, just given the underlying relationship they had from their playing days and being a part of the Red Sox,\" Kennedy explained, per Cotillo. \"But we really needed to stay out of it and let those two either develop the type of relationship working together where things were going to work out long-term or not.\"\n\nCora and Breslow never shared the dugout as teammates with the Red Sox, but the two ex-big leaguers did undergo the ultimate experience during their respective tenures with the organization: Winning the World Series. After back-to-back last-place finishes in the division, Boston's worked to re-stabilize its winning ways and contend, again. Up next, the Red Sox have their sights set on a vital three-game series against the second-place New York Yankees at Fenway Park, which could drastically give the entire franchise a much-needed boost moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

As much as he appreciates the tradition of the Red Sox and the passion of the fan base, he likes winning more.\n\n\"We put everything on the scale. We decided that this is a great opportunity for us,\" Cora said after the deal was announced.\n\nCraig Breslow had only eight career saves. But he proved to be an effective closer as an executive, flying to Denver to finalize the agreement.\n\nLetting Cora escape would have been a disaster. Instead the Sox are set up for what should be a period of prosperity.\n\nRafael Devers, Brayan Bello, and Ceddanne Rafaela are signed to long-term contracts. Kutter Crawford, Jarren Duran, Tanner Houck, and Connor Wong are all under team control through at least 2027.\n\nWilyer Abreu, Brennan Bernardino, David Hamilton, Zack Kelly, and Justin Slaten are among the second-line players who won't be free agents any time soon.\n\nThe Sox also have well-regarded prospects Roman Anthony, Kristian Campbell, Marcelo Mayer, and Kyle Teel moving closer to the big leagues.\n\nThe young, cost-controlled talent should allow for the Sox to pursue any free agents needed to fill the gaps in their roster. If Japanese star Roki Sasaki is made available after this season, the Sox are set up to compete for him. The same would be true for free agents Corbin Burnes and Max Fried.\n\nFree agents make decisions based almost entirely on money. But it's an excellent perk that pitching coach Andrew Bailey has shown the ability to enhance the skills of already established pitchers.\n\nAs Baltimore rises in the American League East and the Yankees continue to swing a financial cudgel, the Sox are positioned to stay in contention.\n\nBreslow has only been on the job for nine months but has the Sox going in the right direction after consecutive last-place finishes.\n\nGreat. What's next?\n\nThe trade deadline is 6 p.m. on Tuesday and the Sox have three needs: a righthanded hitter, a starting pitcher, and relief help.\n\nThe Sox have a .767 OPS against righthanded starters, third highest in the game. It's .721 against lefthanded starters, 15th in the league. A righthanded-hitting second baseman such as Luis Rengifo of the Angels would balance the lineup.\n\nOr the Sox could seek a DH to platoon with Masataka Yoshida. A reunion with Justin Turner would fill that need.\n\nThe only two starts the Sox have had from a lefthanded pitcher this season came from Bernardino when he was used as an opener.\n\nGarrett Crochet (White Sox), Yusei Kikuchi (Blue Jays), and Tarik Skubal (Tigers) are trade candidates.\n\nBut Crochet has already thrown 111\u2153 innings in his first season as a starter, and the Tigers would expect top-level prospects for Skubal, who won't reach free agency until after the 2026 season.\n\nKikuchi is durable and has pitched better than his 4-9 record and 4.54 ERA would indicate. His walks are down and his strikeouts are up.\n\nThe Angels would want a good return for All-Star Tyler Anderson, who is signed through 2025.\n\nBullpen help could come from most anywhere. This need is less defined in the sense that the Sox simply need another good option or two in the late innings. Of course, the same is true for every contender.\n\nThere hasn't been much action across the game but that should change this weekend.\n\nThat the Sox are better than expected this season and have built a base of talent for their manager are all positives. Now the Yankees arrive at Fenway Park on Friday for a three-game series.\n\nThe Sox were outscored by 35 runs by the Dodgers and Rockies on their 1-5 road trip. The trip left the Sox a game out of a playoff spot.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

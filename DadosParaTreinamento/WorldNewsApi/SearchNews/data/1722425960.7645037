Let's discuss with Bryan Lanza. He was deputy communications director for Trump's 2016 campaign. And, Bryan, I mean, the president sort of let Donald Trump off the hook last night with a shaky performance because Trump, over and over again, he was lying, he was pushing these widely debunked conspiracy theories. Why does he keep doing that? BRYAN LANZA (FORMER SENIOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE): Listen, I wouldn't say Joe Biden let Donald Trump off the hook at all last night. I think what we saw last night was the mental deterioration of Joe Biden. And we can talk about, you know, Donald Trump said this, we can talk about, you know, Joe Biden's lie here. But what the American public saw was a president who just doesn't have the cognitive fitness to be president. And we'll have a conversation in next month, you know, whether the 25th Amendment is exercised, where the Democratic Party tries to find a new candidate. I think Joe Biden should be on the ballot through November. I don't think they shouldn't be allowed to switch candidates at this point. They voted. They want him there. We're running. We spent resources. It feels cheating to try to change it at this point. ACOSTA: Well, you don't want that to happen because you want your candidate to win, obviously. But, I mean, let me ask you about -- LANZA: I want the American public to be in a better position tomorrow than they are today. ACOSTA: But let me ask you about some of these -- let me ask you, why does Trump keep saying that Democrats want to execute babies after birth? That's a lie. It's not true. LANZA: Sure, I think what you have to do is you have to sort of have the conversation with the campaign to see where they lie. I think the most important thing that I walked away from the abortion conversation last night was that President Trump was proud of nominating Supreme Court justices who did overturn Roe v. Wade and returned it to the states, which is where the American public has wanted it for a significant amount of time. Now, sure, CNN can sort of cover, or MSNBC and Atlas can try to sort of focus on the lies. ACOSTA: Don't go after-- don't talk about the press. Come on. He's lying over and over again. LANZA: You have to talk about the press. ACOSTA: No, Bryan, he said that January 6th defendants are, quote, \"so innocent.\" LANZA: Correct. ACOSTA: These are people who are criminals. LANZA: And what did voters decide on that? And what did voters decide on that? ACOSTA: They stormed the Capitol. LANZA: Yes. ACOSTA: They broke the law. That would have never happened had Donald Trump just accepted the results of the 2020 election, and you know that. LANZA: Sure. But what have voters decided on that? The voters decided that is not their priority when they're voting this election. They're deciding \u2013 ACOSTA: Republican voters decided it. LANZA: Sure. And he's winning independent voters and he's winning the general election in these swing states. So, all voters at this particular-- at this point made a decision that January 6th is not relevant to their lives. They're saying inflation is relevant to their lives. They're saying immigration is relevant to their lives. They're saying two wars are relevant to their lives with a third one about to start. I get it that the media wants to give cover to Joe Biden and focus about the past, but the future is green. ACOSTA: The media wants to give cover to Joe Biden? Everybody is reporting, we just went through all the headlines and all the major newspapers, all the networks are all saying that the president had a shaky debate performance last night. LANZA: And you want to focus on January 6th. The voters aren't focusing on January 6th. ACOSTA: We're focusing on what Donald Trump said last night-- LANZA: Let me tell you-- ACOSTA: -- because he lied repeatedly over and over again. And the president went after Trump at one point on his character. Let's listen to that because I think that's an important part of this too. (...) ACOSTA: Does anybody believe that? LANZA: Listen, what everybody believes is that the economy today, inflation is ruining their lives. And so sort of focusing -- I think that's the problem that Joe Biden and his campaign have, is they can't focus on their accomplishments of the past that address immigration, that address inflation, that address the wars. They have to focus on these other things. And so going forward, Jim, you tell me what's better for the country? Having a conversation about January 6th or having a conversation about immigration and inflation? The voters are making that choice. ACOSTA: Well, I mean, accepting election results is awfully important. LANZA: Listen, I encourage Joe Biden to keep talking -- ACOSTA: I mean, and the former president last night did not accept the election results. [CROSSTALK] LANZA: -- under a second President Trump term, and we both know it today. ACOSTA: But let me ask you this, if Joe Biden is somehow not on the ticket, the Trump campaign is worried. LANZA: Joe Biden. ACOSTA: They're worried if there's another candidate that rises up and becomes the Democratic nominee? LANZA: No. Listen, if Joe Biden were to step down, it's clearly going to be Kamala Harris. We're not worried about Kamala Harris. In fact, that's what the voters need to understand. This performance last -- ACOSTA: Can Trump beat Gavin Newsom? Gavin Newsom's not the candidate. He's in a -- it's not about Gavin. The next candidate, if Joe Biden were to drop out, is going to be Kamala Harris. And the voters have made the decision that they trust President Trump far more than Kamala Harris. ACOSTA: All right. Bryan Lanza, thanks for coming in.

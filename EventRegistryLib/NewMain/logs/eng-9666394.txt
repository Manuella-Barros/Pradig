We represent less than 1% of the state's population. So having a time and a place for all of us to come together and fellowship, it's been amazing,\" said Pamela Smith, an Educator and a guest speaker, when talking about the celebration.\n\nA new element to this year's celebration was the acclimation of the Juneteenth flag. The star in the middle of the flag represents the emancipation of slaves in Texas, and it ties the history of America to the Juneteenth holiday.\n\n\"I'm thinking and envisioning that at some point in time, Montana will be flying the flag over its capitol building,\" said Dexter Royes, a founding member of Black Montana Collective.\n\nThe main message from the event was to celebrate the end of slavery, but also to educate people about current economic inequality and African American's ongoing struggle to overcome racial biases.\n\nMore from this section Fire Breaks Out Near Manipur CM's

we have, a sincere and caring community in Missoula, that are interested in understanding, and up the awareness to start the healing process with so many marginalized Americans,\" said Andrea Davis,

He saw a woman standing near Yearboro, who was falling to the ground. The witness reported seeing what he thought was a revolver-style handgun in the woman's hand. The suspect then walked up the stairs to the fourplex. Law enforcement identified the suspect as Eikens.\n\nOfficers set up a perimeter around the crime scene and started evacuating other residents of the fourplex. Hours later, Eikens came out and was placed into custody.\n\nThursday's hearing was brief. Eikens' defense attorney is Missoula lawyer Jordan Kilby. She said she's saving bail arguments for a later time.\n\nEikens is currently in custody at the Missoula jail on a $1,000,000 bail.

This history is important.\"\n\nShe said that history is being erased all over the country by groups who want to try to sanitize the horrendous parts of America's past.\n\n\"We are free-ish, trapped in the matrix being controlled by those who want to remain in control,\" she said. \"Those in control say 'we don't need affirmative action,' right? They say 'we don't need it, we've achieved equality.' There are some that say we have achieved equality. Equality assumes that everyone is operating at the same starting point and will face the same challenges.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nShe noted that her Black ancestors, and many formerly enslaved people, were lied to by the American government when they were promised land. Smith said that white settlers, who took land from Indigenous people, built up great generational wealth for white people today by passing down land from generation to generation.\n\n\"This is wealth that we as African Americans don't have,\" she said.\n\nSylvie Tower, an undergraduate student at the University of Montana studying biochemistry and health science, gave a speech on the importance of learning history accurately.\n\nShe said many stories of Black women have been overlooked, inaccurately recounted or silenced.\n\nTower said Rosa Parks is known in popular American history as a quiet seamstress who was \"too tired\" to get up from her seat on the bus.\n\n\"Rosa Parks' true self has been distorted over the course of 70 years,\" Tower explained. \"She in fact was not tired. She was intentional, angry and unwilling to be pushed around again.\"\n\nParks' philosophies on Constitutional rights clashed so heavily with other Montgomery, Alabama leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. that Parks felt compelled to leave the city, Tower said.\n\n\"Rosa Parks was an action-driven, pro-militant supporter of the Black Power movement,\" Tower said. \"Rosa Parks was not quiet. She was outspoken, well-written and highly active in politics. That is her truth.\"\n\nThe event also featured speakers from the Montana Black Collective Missoula talking about what Juneteenth means to them.\n\nThe Montana Black Collective Missoula was \"born out of a need to address the emotional impact of an incident that occurred during a rally at the Missoula courthouse,\" the group said in the event flyer.\n\n\"This incident, which involved the police and an African American youth, left many participants feeling fearful and unsupported,\" the statement continued. \"Long-standing members of the African diaspora in the community recognized the need for an organization that could empower people of African ancestry and foster ways for support. As a result, they continued to meet and discuss forming an organization to help those in need.\"\n\nFor more information, visit Montanablackcollective.org/.\n\nDavid Erickson is the business reporter for the Missoulian.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

His op-ed on June 11 was so full of gaslighting that I don't know where to start! So let's talk electric vehicles. According to Thielman, they don't work in Montana. Tell that to all the Tesla drivers I see in the Rattlesnake and around town. Or how about the electric buses have been operating in Missoula for years? I believe they work. Or the electric school buses in Havre that according to the school system functioned better in last winter's cold snap than diesel buses. Now schools in Clinton, Bigfork and Fairfield have EV buses.\n\nIn 2023, 83% of Norway's new car sales were electric! I seem to recall that Norway's winters are not exactly balmy. Instead of criticizing the Biden administration over its efforts to mitigate disastrous climate change impacts, Mr. Thielman should be grateful that through the Inflation Reduction Act and other legislation we are finally making some real changes to get us weaned from fossil fuels.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nGroup intends to sue over Montana grizzly bear translocation Blackfeet Nation closes Chief Mountain to public Business Buzz: One coffee shop closes, another opens; fund set up for mobile home park Business Buzz: New cafe, new hotel, new barbecue supply store, new mural UPDATED: One person wounded, one arrested following incident at Sha-Ron on Friday Montana Army National Guard loses load on Helena street Community Medical Center CEO resigns Heart Butte School District welcomes a new superintendent New 445-housing unit 'agrihood' subdivision proposed west of Missoula Missoula County loosens permitting process for residential decks, gazebos, greenhouses Commissioner: GOP candidate was not qualified for attorney general race New conservation easement outside of Victor protects 80-year legacy Group caught on camera vandalizing Pride flag at downtown Missoula business Fundraiser launched for Missoula 4-year-old's medical bills after crash Report finds flaws in Montana Board of Housing's tax credit distribution\n\nThank you to Sen.

All data is from 2019 unless otherwise specified.\n\nMissoula County renewed its contract this week with a national provider for all-encompassing medical services at the jail.\n\nCounty commissioners voted on Tuesday to approve a five-year contract with Wellpath, the same company the jail has been using in past years for medical, dental and behavioral health care. The fixed annual cost is $2,804,088 billed monthly to the county.\n\nWellpath is a Tennessee-based corporation that provides medical care at jails around the nation.\n\nThe jail issued a request for proposals for medical service providers, said jail commander Sheryl Ziegler at Tuesday's meeting, looking for vendors who provide comprehensive care to anyone housed at the detention center.\n\nWellpath had a few competitors this year -- two other groups put in applications.\n\n\"Through a competitive process, Wellpath was selected for that, for the quality of care they bring, the options they have on the table for us and including the cost of providing those services,\" Ziegler said. \"They were our provider previously, and they had some competition this year, but ultimately were the best option for the Missoula County Detention Facility moving forward.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

If someone is on Medicaid, their coverage is paused when they're booked into the jail and the county covers any medical or dental expenses they incur.\n\nThe current daily rate for a person incarcerated at the Missoula jail is $125, according to Missoula Sheriff's Office Spokesperson Jeannette Smith.\n\nWellpath's services cover people held at the jail by the state, too, but the state pays back a daily rate for some, but not all, of their medical costs, Ziegler said.\n\nCounties paying the bill to hold state inmates has been a long-standing issue in Montana, the Helena Independent Record reported. In 2020, Missoula County filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Corrections to recoup the funds footed by county taxpayers for state inmates.\n\nZo\u00eb Buchli is the education reporter for the Missoulian.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Jon Tester shows that Jason can't distinguish partisan politics from common sense.\n\nHe disparages Tester's environmental organization campaign contributions, along with climate change advocates generally. The fact is dozens of environmental and conservation organizations employing and involving thousands of Montanans call Montana home. Most, or all, rightly see climate change as a top national priority. The plaintiffs who won their climate change lawsuit against the state several months ago are all Montanans, as are their parents.\n\nJason insults their commitment, but this is hardly surprising when his longtime former boss, Sen. Steve Daines, has his own head stuck in the sand on the issue. As for lobbyist contributions, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which Jason directs, has received over $133 million since January 2023, with another $40-50 million projected after the June 30 reporting period ends.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nGroup intends to sue over Montana grizzly bear translocation Blackfeet Nation closes Chief Mountain to public Business Buzz: One coffee shop closes, another opens; fund set up for mobile home park Business Buzz: New cafe, new hotel, new barbecue supply store, new mural UPDATED: One person wounded, one arrested following incident at Sha-Ron on Friday Montana Army National Guard loses load on Helena street Community Medical Center CEO resigns Heart Butte School District welcomes a new superintendent New 445-housing unit 'agrihood' subdivision proposed west of Missoula Missoula County loosens permitting process for residential decks, gazebos, greenhouses Commissioner: GOP candidate was not qualified for attorney general race New conservation easement outside of Victor protects 80-year legacy Group caught on camera vandalizing Pride flag at downtown Missoula business Fundraiser launched for Missoula 4-year-old's medical bills after crash Report finds flaws in Montana Board of Housing's tax credit distribution\n\nThese are much larger amounts than what the Democratic counterpart committee has gotten and come heavily from big corporate interests. Anyone who ever worked in the Washington, D.C., political arena like I did knows that lobbyists give big dollars to these committees formed to elect their party candidates to the Senate; and even bigger dollars directly to the candidates, especially incumbents. Daines himself likely never rejected a lawful lobbyist contribution; and he'll be getting many more of these, especially from fossil fuel lobbyists, when he runs again in 2026.\n\nJason's job requires him to attack Tester, but he may have picked the wrong issue to do so this time.\n\nDavid Aronofsky,\n\nMissoula", "source": {"uri": "missoulian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "missoulian.com"},

They said they've all watched people struggle to access essential services such as Medicaid and food programs.\n\n\"Thousands of Montana families encounter periods of difficulty when they need access to a secure and manageable safety net,\" the letter said.\n\nDated June 17, the letter asks the Republican governor to allocate more funding to the Department of Public Health and Human Services, the state's largest agency that oversees the vast majority of public assistance programs, so it can hire more staff and modernize systems.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nGroup intends to sue over Montana grizzly bear translocation Blackfeet Nation closes Chief Mountain to public Business Buzz: One coffee shop closes, another opens; fund set up for mobile home park Business Buzz: New cafe, new hotel, new barbecue supply store, new mural UPDATED: One person wounded, one arrested following incident at Sha-Ron on Friday Community Medical Center CEO resigns Montana Army National Guard loses load on Helena street Missoula County loosens permitting process for residential decks, gazebos, greenhouses New 445-housing unit 'agrihood' subdivision proposed west of Missoula Heart Butte School District welcomes a new superintendent Commissioner: GOP candidate was not qualified for attorney general race New conservation easement outside of Victor protects 80-year legacy Report finds flaws in Montana Board of Housing's tax credit distribution Group caught on camera vandalizing Pride flag at downtown Missoula business Fundraiser launched for Missoula 4-year-old's medical bills after crash\n\nAlthough difficulty navigating the public benefits process isn't necessarily new, Medicaid redetermination made these problems more glaring, said Jackie Semmens, a policy analyst at the Montana Budget and Policy Center, which signed the letter.\n\nWhat started as a few organizations sharing their experiences organically grew to a much larger group.\n\n\"It spread out to a larger community of advocates, providers and social service groups who end up seeing the brunt of what happens when the state isn't able to process benefits in a timely manner,\" Semmens said. \"I think if we had kept it open, it would have kept getting forwarded.\n\nThe letter suggests four major areas of investment: to increase options for in-person assistance; improve phone and website accessibility; increase critical agency personnel to support families; and improve communications with clients.\n\nAs part of the state's widespread spending reductions in a 2017 special legislative session under then-Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, DPHHS was tasked with cutting $49 million. It laid off a slew of staff and closed 19 Offices of Public Assistance. The letter urges Gianforte to fund re-opening offices in areas without adequate services.\n\nFewer in-person offices put more pressure on community-based organizations like the ones that authored the letter. It also jammed up the telephone help line. Long wait times and inconsistent callback procedures became commonplace.\n\nCharlie Brereton, director of DPHHS, acknowledged that a surge in call volumes during Medicaid redetermination has put more pressure on the help line at an interim budget meeting Thursday discussing the health department's finances.\n\n\"We are working to understand what we can do to improve (it) for the Montanans we serve moving forward,\" he said. \"We do have some proposals moving forward as part of the governor's budget planning process.\"\n\nSpending on staffing would address a number of the barriers people face, according to the letter. It says that employing more people would reduce procedural delays and streamline application processes. Additionally, the letter's authors believe that having more people on staff would allow the department to update its website and phone capabilities.\n\nAs of May 1, about 85% of the 2,805 full-time positions budgeted for DPHHS were filled, according to agency data.\n\n\"We just want to be clear that we know the staffers working on these issues are doing everything they can,\" Semmens said. \"We know it's a matter of adequate funding, not that anyone wants to see people fall through the cracks.\"\n\nGianforte's office declined to comment, instead directing the Montana State News Bureau to the health department.\n\n\"The letter makes specific budget requests, and at this time, DPHHS is in the preliminary stages of the executive budget planning process for the upcoming legislative session,\" said agency spokesperson Jon Ebelt. \"DPHHS appreciates the feedback and suggestions included in the letter and will consider them.\"\n\nCarly Graf is the State Bureau health care reporter for Lee

The state-run initiative reimbursable through Medicaid brings licensed practitioners straight to the classroom to support students experiencing mental health crises.\n\nProgramming always declines in the summer for WMMHC as fewer students rely on the school for their support services, but its mental health care teams are typically put on \"variable status,\" meaning they work a reduced load of 10 to 20 hours per week.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead, it placed teams with heavier summer workloads on the reduced schedule, putting the remaining providers on \"reduction in force status,\" interim Executive Administrator Colleen Rudio told the Montana State News Bureau.\n\nAccording to Rudio, there are five full teams across multiple school districts that will remain in place during the summer months, serving about 60 students with another 10 who said they might participate. Those teams account for about 13 staff members.\n\nAnother 16 WMHCC employees will be placed on the reduction in force status. Employees whose roles have been suspended do not have work and will not receive pay. Should WMMHC restart the school-based program or some version of it within 13 weeks, the clinic is required to give these former staffers the right of first refusal to have their jobs back.\n\nRudio said she could not say how many students would be affected by the service lapse since the number of students for summer programming wasn't confirmed. She did say that the teams suspended for the coming months were those with smaller caseloads.\n\nAdditionally, Rudio did not provide a list of all the impacted school districts. The Montana State News Bureau confirmed that Missoula County Public Schools has lost services at one school at least. NBC Montana reported that Lolo School District was having services cut.\n\nWMHCC plans to re-evaluate the CSCT program and determine how it can provide essential services for young Montanans while remaining sustainable, something it has struggled to achieve in recent years.\n\n\"We are simply using this time to make the most efficient and best decisions we can,\" Rudio said.\n\nAccording to correspondence obtained by the Montana State News Bureau, families were given 10 days' notice of the forthcoming change. Students who have been receiving services through the program will be referred to other community providers effective June 21 if their school's care team is suspended.\n\n\"I don't think there's ever an ideal time for parents to receive notice,\" Rudio said. \"We recognize that.\"\n\nCSCT pairs licensed or supervised in-training practitioners from a mental health center and behavioral health aides with children who can get services at school, in their homes or in the community. Teams provide intensive and hands-on service to the kids who need it most, reducing the barriers to accessing care by making it available directly in the school.\n\nIt's been the subject of repeated disagreements at the Legislature for multiple years. Sparring and bureaucratic mishaps have contributed to fewer school districts participating and fewer students receiving mental health care.\n\nIn 2015, there were over 100 districts participating, serving around 5,000 students. As of 2021, there were only 50 school districts participating, reaching just 3,827 students.\n\nJon Ebelt, spokesperson for DPHHS, told the Bureau that 48 school districts have submitted the necessary memorandum of understanding to the agency agreeing to the payment process. As of May, only 36 of the districts who had agreed to the program parameters were actually billing for the service.\n\nAll this comes against a backdrop of a worsening health crisis among Montana youth.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMore high schoolers either considered, planned or attempted suicide last school year than in the three decades before, according to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. A DPHHS report concluded that the state's suicide rate among young people between 11 and 17 years old is double the national average.\n\nOversight of the CSCT program has changed hands twice since 2021. First, the state Legislature opted to move the program from the purview of the Department of Public Health and Human Services to the state's education agency, citing frustrations with the handling of financial challenges.\n\nUnder the Office of Public Instruction, districts said they experienced undue administrative burden and struggled to get clarity on how to implement the program. There was also an ongoing back-and-forth between lawmakers, government agencies, third-party mental health care providers and school districts over who should foot how much of the bill.\n\nThe 2023 Legislature decided to transition the CSCT program yet again back over to the health department, basically turning the clock back on how things were before the previous changes, effective July of last year.\n\n\"No roadblocks were identified\" during the transition, according to Ebelt. The same program rules and requirements have been in effect since 2021 with DPHHS taking over from OPI to address education, communication and information.\n\n\"There were no changes to the role of (DPHHS) overseeing the programmatic, enrollment and claims aspects of the program,\" Ebelt said, responding to questions about any changes the department had made since taking back over.\n\nDPHHS Director Charlie Brereton told lawmakers in 2023 ahead of the program's move over to his agency that they would like to explore ideas for what an alternative school-based model might look like, but that nothing would happen to CSCT for at least another year.\n\n\"We also want to think in the future and do a deep dive on what's working, what's not, and ask is CSCT really serving Montana students well in 2023?\" he said at the time.\n\nRudio from WMMHC says the facility's summer pause on the program is directly tied to this very question. She said the clinic will be working with the health department and school districts to determine how to most effectively serve families and students come the fall.\n\n\"It may very well be CSCT,\" Rudio said. \"This is an assessment period.\"\n\nEbelt did not share any plans for how CSCT might evolve in the future.\n\nChallenges with the program aren't necessarily unique to the western Montana nonprofit.\n\nDistricts have been stalled by paperwork backlogs and a web of requirements that make responsiveness all but impossible. Third-party providers in certain parts of the state have run into staffing issues, dwindling the availability of aides and practitioners in classrooms.\n\nFunding has been a continued roadblock in recent years, too.\n\nChanges to the Medicaid reimbursement rate in 2021 made it harder for districts to pay their share of program fees. Lawmakers in that year's Legislature decided not to allocate $20 million that would have helped offset the remaining balance borne by school districts after Medicaid reimbursements, also contributing to fewer schools electing to fund the program for their students.\n\nProviders like WMHCC were also hit hard by Medicaid redetermination, a process that's led to more than 130,000 in Montana losing health insurance coverage under the joint federal-state program. Rudio said redetermination meant the facility could not bill the state for the same number of children as it had previously, so it went into this summer with less Medicaid money than it had planned.\n\nOne of the things WMHCC will be exploring is whether it should offer home support or outpatient services for youth, as opposed to the clinic's current model of school-based care.\n\n\"We are committed to working with school districts and the state to make sure we make the decision as quickly as we can,\" Rudio said.\n\nCarly Graf is the State Bureau healthcare reporter for Lee Montana.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

I'd venture to speculate the general line of thinking would be enjoying our wide open spaces (range/agricultural lands, forests, multiple streams/rivers/lakes) with clean air and water, providing healthy living and recreational activities.\n\nThis vision of \"our Montana way of life\" requires us to address the critical issue of climate change head-on and aggressively.

A meet and greet, \"where you can shake hands with the players and take pictures with them\" Halmes said, starts at 5 p.m.\n\nOnly a limited number of tickets remain, with 36 left as of Wednesday afternoon, said Halmes. Tickets are available for $100 by calling Janet Schuh at 406-598-3297 or at Universal Athletic stores in Montana.\n\nHalmes said crowds have averaged between 350 and 400 on induction night and the largest attendance over the years was approximately 420 people. He's expecting a crowd approaching 400 on Saturday and said many will have attended past ceremonies but every year the attendees include a \"broad\" range of first-timers.\n\n'All of these guys have been gentlemen'\n\nIn the Players category, those being honored with induction are: Chase Reynolds, Drummond High School, Montana, RB, NFL (St. Louis Rams/Los Angeles Rams 2013-16); Mark McGrath, Montana State, WR, NFL (Seattle Seahawks 1981, Washington Redskins 1983-85); Matt Clark, Missoula Hellgate, Montana, WR, CFL (BC Lions 1991-1996, Edmonton Eskimos 1998); Brock Osweiler, Kalispell Flathead, Arizona State, QB, NFL (Denver Broncos 2012-2015, Houston Texans 2016, Broncos 2017, Miami Dolphins 2018); and Marc Mariani, Havre, Montana, WR/kick and punt returns, NFL (Tennessee Titans 2010-2011, Chicago Bears 2014-15, Titans 2016).\n\n\"All of these guys have been gentlemen and are very courteous,\" said Halmes, who also rattled off stories about those in the Players category that attendees will undoubtedly hear Saturday night, of his interactions with those receiving honors.\n\nIn the Legacy category, two players will be honored posthumously in Frosty Peters, Montana State, NFL, and Paul Szakash, Fenger High School in Chicago, Montana, NFL. Peters, who according to profootballreference.com went to high school in Billings, died in 1980 at age 75 and Szakash died in 1984 at age 71.\n\n\"Frosty Peters, who played at Montana State, kicked 17 drop-kick field goals in one game, whoever heard of that?\" Halmes said. \"And Paul Szakash will have some of his family in attendance. It is great to have family of a Legacy person there.\"\n\nIn the Support category, Chuck Karnop (Harlowton, Montana State) will be honored. Karnop, who according to his biography for his induction in 2003 as an honorary member into the Montana Coaches Association Hall of Fame for longevity and service, was the MSU head athletic trainer from 1968-2001.\n\n\"You couldn't find a finer gentleman who worked with student-athletes,\" Halmes said of Karnop.\n\n\"I have just been so impressed with this class across the board.\"\n\nSpeak Up/Let's Talk\n\nThe Speak Up/Let's Talk Symposium on Mental Health will also be a part of the weekend for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe symposium begins at 10 a.m. Saturday and runs through 2 p.m. at the Billings Hotel. Halmes noted \"lunch is part of it,\" and the event is free to the public.\n\nThe target audience is coaches, administrators and athletes ages 15 through 25, said Halmes. Logan Health is a partner in bringing the Speak Up/Let's Talk Symposium to the public through hall of fame weekend this year.\n\nRobert Doore, Dane Fletcher inspired Montana Football HOF to form mental health symposium\n\nSpeakers include Robert Doore, who helped create the first Speak Up symposium, D-I basketball coach Dennis Harp, former pro basketball player Ryan Wetzel, former pro volleyball player Capri Richardson, and Joe McClafferty of Logan Health.\n\n\"The speakers this year bring an awful lot of mental health information to the table,\" said Halmes.\n\n'Blood, sweat and tears'\n\nHalmes is grateful that this is the eighth induction class and that the \"Big Huddle\" -- a group of former Eastern Montana College football players and school alumni whose main goal is to bring football back to Montana State Billings -- created the Montana Football Hall of Fame.\n\nSaturday night will be a special time for those enshrined, their family, friends and fans, and those in attendance, he said.\n\n\"Now all the people who told me it wouldn't work eight years ago say, 'We are really glad you didn't listen to us.' And I say, 'I'm too-hardheaded not to try.'\"\n\n\"Those players that put in the blood, sweat and tears deserve to be recognized.\"\n\nFast forwarding to next year, Halmes said 28 nominations have been turned in so far. Those who want to nominate someone for HOF consideration can visit the Montana Football Hall of Fame website and click on \"Selection Committee\" and click on the link to the form. Or, if interested, call Halmes at 406-208-8142 and he'll get you a form.\n\nThe Class of 2025 is expected to be announced in early September.\n\nThe physical location of the Montana Football Hall of Fame is at the Universal Athletic store in Bozeman.\n\nEmail Gazette Sports Editor John Letasky at john.letasky@406mtsports.com or follow him on X/Twitter at @GazSportsJohnL\n\n0 Comments Be the first

Greg Gianforte and the North Phillips County Cooperative State Grazing District appealed to halt implementation, also called a stay.\n\nLast October, Interior Department administrative law Judge Veronica Larvie denied the appeal.\n\nLarvie noted in her decision the state and ranchers had \"raised significant doubts\" about whether the BLM had properly analyzed fencing changes when granting grazing lease modifications for American Prairie but hadn't proved the \"likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm.\"\n\nSo the state and ranchers appealed Judge Larvie's decision.\n\nOn May 29, the Interior Board of Land Appeals upheld Judge Larvie's decision.\n\n\"To prevail on appeal, the party must demonstrate error in the (judge's) order,\" the appeals judges wrote. \"Specifically, the party must demonstrate that the (judge) committed a material error of law or fact or failed to demonstrate a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.\"\n\nIn failing to do so, the state's appeal for a stay was denied again.\n\n\"We appreciate the thoughtful consideration being given to this issue,\" said Pete Geddes, vice president and chief external relations officer for American Prairie, in an email. \"Grazing bison on federal public lands is in total compliance with the BLM's conservation goals and authority, and we look forward to the completion of this case.\"\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Tom Burgess, who owns a 20-acre inholding through which Forest Service Road 1890 passes, alerted law enforcement to Volesky's use of the road, arguing that it amounted to trespassing.\n\nA week later, FWP Chief of Enforcement Ron Howell summoned Volesky to his office to discuss Burgess' accusation.\n\nDuring that meeting, as recounted in Volesky's legal filing, Volesky explained to Howell that he and Burgess share \"personal history.\" Burgess is Volesky's former brother-in-law. Though the two once jointly purchased a boat for shared use, relations between them have been strained for more than a decade, Volesky told MTFP.\n\nLater that day, Howell issued a citation to Volesky for failure to obtain landowner permission for hunting, a misdemeanor that carries a fine of up to $500. The following week, department leadership placed Volesky on paid administrative leave.\n\nVolesky's attorney presented two arguments in the motion to dismiss. The first is that Forest Service Road 1890 \"was not then and is not now private property,\" having been open to the public since 1883. The second is that even if the road were closed to public use, Tom Burgess' now-deceased father, Hank Burgess, had explicitly granted Volesky permission to use the road for hunting, a privilege that \"does not permit future owners of the property to revoke access granted by Hank.\"\n\nOn March 13, the day after Volesky's attorney submitted the motion to dismiss, Rothwell dropped the charges against Volesky in a one-page document.\n\nRothwell did not respond to MTFP's request for additional information about the county's reasons for dropping the charge.\n\nVolesky argues that the department relied on a \"tortured legal explanation\" to underpin its decision to place him on leave and clung to that logic even when the charges didn't stick.\n\n\"Other wardens have told me, 'We would never issue a citation in this situation. We just never win on those,'\" Volesky said. \"No other employee I know of has even been disciplined for such a thing.\"\n\nShould the department successfully apply the logic it used to fire Volesky in its treatment of other contested roads and trails, recreationists across the state stand to lose much of the public land access they currently enjoy, Volesky argues.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAt issue is the public's use of roads and trails that lack recorded easements, which appear on a property title. Though not codified in writing, public use of such rights-of-way to access Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management land via \"unperfected\" or \"historic\" easements is common across the West.\n\n\"That easement issue was such a canard -- so wrong and so irrelevant,\" Volesky said. \"The department has conjured up this tortured legal explanation of, 'Oh, no, it's really not determined, so you should have known better.' Well, then, it's not determined on thousands of places. That's true of thousands of places in Montana on state and federal land.\"\n\nVolesky argues that such a conclusion is \"preposterous.\"\n\n\"If this were to become a big case and become precedent, people across Montana would become unglued,\" he said.\n\nAsked for insight regarding department leadership's desire to terminate his employment, Volesky said he thinks it's related to \"political discrimination\" -- more specifically, his tenure working on natural resource issues for the Democratic governors who preceded Montana's current governor, Greg Gianforte, a Republican. In 2004, Volesky was a natural resource policy adviser to Brian Schweitzer. Eight years later, when Steve Bullock was in office, Volesky became deputy director of FWP. He later transitioned to chief of operations.\n\nVolesky said he suspects that lawmakers and politically powerful individuals with differing views about carnivore management, elk tag allocation, bison management, and land access and acquisition -- \"all of those controversial issues\" -- leaned on Gianforte and the FWP directors Gianforte has appointed to remove employees who worked on those issues when Schweitzer and Bullock helmed the state's executive branch.\n\nAsked for a response to that assertion, Giaforte spokesperson Kaitlin Price referred MTFP to FWP, which didn't address the question directly.\n\nBeyond noting that the investigation that preceded Volesky's firing was conducted by an independent investigator, Lemon said the agency couldn't provide additional information about a personnel matter.\n\nVolesky's firing comes as the department is receiving increasing public scrutiny for the departure of longtime employees in leadership positions.\n\nFormer Chief of Enforcement Dave Loewen retired in November 2022 after being placed on administrative leave four months prior for allegedly creating a hostile work environment. Loewen received $150,000 as part of a legal agreement with the state, which included Loewen's pledge not to sue for further damages or disparage the state.\n\nIn May, FWP Fisheries Chief Eileen Ryce was placed on administrative leave under unclear circumstances. Within two weeks of that decision, which reportedly involved Ryce being \"publicly escorted\" out of the agency's headquarters, a GoFundMe account was established to help pay for Ryce's \"expected legal expenses.\"\n\nLemon did not respond to MTFP's questions regarding Ryce's employment at the agency. She has worked at the department for 20 years and became fisheries chief in 2016.\n\nAs of June 19, more than $12,000 had been contributed to the GoFundMe account by 162 individual donors. Former FWP Fisheries Chief Christopher Hunter, former Deputy Director Ronald Marcoux, and Larry Peterman, who became chief of operations after leading FWP's fisheries division, have contributed to Ryce's cause.\n\nAsked for information on the circumstances surrounding the agency's decision to put her on administrative leave, Ryce connected MTFP with her attorney, Murry Warhank, who responded that he \"cannot comment on Eileen's situation at this time.\"\n\nFWP is currently being audited by the Legislative Audit Division, which shared with lawmakers on Monday that its review of the department's human resources work will focus on the hiring, supervising and disciplining of staff between fiscal years 2019 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to interviewing current and former agency managers, auditors will review 50 randomly selected performance evaluations, documentation associated with 60 randomly selected hiring decisions, and settlement agreements the agency reached with former employees. State auditors are expected to deliver a report next year.\n\nFWP has an annual budget of approximately $110 million and employs a staff of about 750 full-time employees.\n\nThis story was originally published by Montana Free Press at montanafreepress.org.

He gave Hubber 20 years for aggravated burglary but that will run concurrently to the longer sentence.\n\nA jury in March found Hubber and Nicholas John Jeager guilty on aggravated burglary and homicide charges tied to the bounty hunt. They were trying to apprehend fugitive David Sandoval but Harris, the homeowner, was killed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sandoval fled the house but was quickly in police custody.\n\nHubber maintains that Sandoval had violated his bail contracts and had bench warrants so he had authority to apprehend him. Jaeger says he shot the gun but only because Harris was coming at him with a knife.\n\nDefense attorneys say the home was a \"trap house\" where drugs are sold and used and several people confirmed that during the trial. Authorities say everyone inside during the shooting -- including Hubber, Jaeger and Harris -- was drunk or high or both.\n\nDuring Thursday's sentencing hearing, Fivey reiterated what she told jurors in March -- that the case was about Harris more than anything or anyone else and a series of choices and reckless actions led to his death.\n\n\"The bottom line is a man lost his life in his own home,\" Fivey said.\n\nHubber also spoke, saying he believed he had the legal authority to enter Harris' home that night to apprehend Sandoval. But he said he should not have brought Jaeger, who had no experience in bail apprehensions, and took accountability for what transpired.\n\nHe also apologized to members of Harris' family who were in the courtroom Thursday.\n\n\"With all my heart I am sorry for the loss of Bill,\" Hubber said.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nMike Smith is a reporter at the Montana Standard with an emphasis on

In 2007, then-Missoulian reporter Keila Szpaller revealed that city council members were sending emails to each other during public meetings, oftentimes \"discrediting the public, scheduling lunch meetings and making jokes.\" The emails also revealed strategic alliances between some members.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead of a person sending an email to council@ci.missoula.mt.us, there is now a form online at the website ci.missoula.mt.us/FormCenter/City-Council-9/Contact-City-Council-330.\n\nNow, on the website that used to show all the emails to city council listed by date, there is simply a message that says \"As of March 4, 2024, City Council emails will no longer be published on the city website. You may continue to connect with your city council representatives by (contacting individual members or emailing the entire city council through the form).\"\n\nCity council president Amber Sherrill was unaware of the website that showed all the archived emails and was unaware that they were no longer posted until the Missoulian contacted her on Thursday morning.\n\n\"I do think it's important that the public has access to their representatives and all public records are public,\" she said.\n\nAfter looking into the matter, Sherrill called back with an explanation.\n\n\"It's a by-product of going to the new form email system,\" she said.\n\nThe form email system is better for the city council because it requires senders to list which of the six city wards they live in, Sherrill said. Before, when emails were sent to all 12 members, nobody had a clue which ward the sender lived in so sometimes nobody responded.\n\n\"I think it's a great system,\" Sherrill said. \"So now, we can scroll down and say oh, that's Ward 6, that's (Ward 6 representative) Sandy (Vasecka) or oh, that's Ward 4, I need to get back with them.\"\n\nSherrill also said she's been told the old system was extremely labor-intensive for the city clerk, who had to convert dozens of emails everyday into PDFs and then upload them.\n\n\"Especially if we have a contentious issue, they would get behind,\" Sherrill explained.\n\nSherrill said she would work with city staff to look into the possibility of coming up with a system that would allow the emails to be published regularly without taking up too much staff time.\n\nIn the meantime, all emails to city council are still accessible, but they have to be acquired through a more cumbersome public records request through the city.\n\nThe Missoula County website does not publish emails sent to the county commissioners online, but those are also available via a public records request.\n\nUnder the Montana Public Records Act, emails from private citizens and other types of correspondence that are received by government officials are considered public records.\n\nDavid Erickson is the business reporter for the Missoulian.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Wins over Grand Canyon, Marquette, North Dakota and Illinois State highlighted the nonconference season.\n\nA rebound win over Idaho in Boise and home wins over Idaho State and Weber State (which also received regional rankings) paved the way to a 4-4 conference record, with ISU getting the best of UM in the championship tourney.\n\nFor Brown, the No. 8 ranking is a sign of his program getting stronger. The first and only other time the Grizzlies earned a regional ranking was 2022 when they finished No. 9 after going 15-5 and advancing to the conference semifinal.\n\n\"We want to be seen as one of the premier teams in the region, not just the Big Sky Conference,\" he said. \"So, I'm ecstatic that is where we ended up, especially considering we didn't finish the year quite as strongly as we wanted.\n\n\"We had some real good momentum there towards the tail end and some things didn't go our way, but this really gets me excited for the future.\"\n\nComing off an under-the-radar freshman year, Bittner put together one of the best seasons in program history in year two. At 16-2 overall and 7-1 in Big Sky play, the German was a lock for all-conference postseason honors.\n\nHe worked his way up from No. 3 to No. 1 and never looked back, winning six of his last eight matches with his only loss coming to league MVP Mark Keki, a senior from Sacramento State.\n\nHe was also a star in the classroom, pulling off a perfect 4.0 GPA and being named this year's co-recipient of UM's President's Award that goes to the male and female student-athletes who achieved the highest undergraduate GPA in Grizzly Athletics over the previous two semesters.\n\nBittner became the highest ranked Grizzly in program history and the highest ranked Big Sky player in the Mountain Region at No. 10. He is now the highest ranked of four Grizzlies to earn a regional ranking above Big Sky MVP Ed Pudney, who finished No. 14 after his senior season in 2022, Victor Casadevall who was No. 19 in 2018 and Jan Steenkamp who was No. 18 in 2003.\n\nHeading into his junior year he will also be the second-highest returning player in the regional rankings, with all but one player, No. 6 Daniel Arbizu of Denver University, lost to graduation or the transfer portal ahead of him.\n\n\"The fact that Tom is ranked higher than some stellar former players, conference MVPs, as well as some guys who would be on the Mount Rushmore of Griz tennis, is really exciting,\" said Brown.\n\n\"He'll come back as a second highest ranked player in our region which includes power five schools like Utah and BYU. The fact that we've got a guy who, who is set for some great things in wearing the maroon and silver is awesome and lets us know we have someone up top who can really lead from the front.\"\n\nMontana is one of four teams from the Big Sky to earn a regional ranking this year, speaking to the strength of the conference. Northern Arizona topped the list at No 5, Idaho State came in at No. 7, Montana No. 8, and Weber State No. 10.\n\nBittner was the highest ranked of three players from the league in the regional top-20, with NAU's Daniel Torres at No. 16 and ISU's Valentino De Pellegrin at No. 20.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

The committee is made up of Republicans who hold a wide majority in the Legislature; Democrats refused to participate in what they say is a political stunt.\n\nPeople are also reading...

(\"And that is my brief presentation,\" the committee's staff attorney wryly said after walking them through a 36-page memo titled \"Common Legal Terms and Concepts.\")\n\nIt's a steep learning curve to ascend given the short timeframe the committee faces in engineering policy that meets the goals in the committee's title: oversight and reform of another branch of government.\n\nIn an interview with the Montana State News Bureau, Senate President Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, maintained the education is necessary to properly handle the task ahead of them. And while just one committee member participating on the committee is an attorney, several are involved in either judiciary policy committees or relevant fiscal committees over the past several sessions.\n\n\"I have very serious people who are very committed to the committee,\" he said. \"I think we have an achievable mission. Whatever amount of meetings it's going to take is what we will do.\"\n\nBruce Spencer, a lobbyist representing the State Bar of Montana, has been on hand to answer lawmakers' sometimes pointed questions as they learn about legal disputes and constitutional law.\n\nSen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, asked Spencer to explain how the courts, by Emrich's analysis to be the opinions of a few, are able to overturn the Legislature, the most representative branch of government in relation to the public.\n\n\"Because someone has to do it, to be a check on the legislative branch,\" Spencer said. \"To say, 'Sorry, even though it's the majority opinion of the Legislature, the Constitution says otherwise.' The Constitution is designed to protect the minority.\"\n\nThe committee also features three citizen members Ellsworth appointed, all three of which are attorneys. He said he thoroughly vetted the 15 applications for people who would not derail the work.\n\n\"I didn't want to find extremists,\" Ellsworth said. \"I was looking for people that wanted to solve a legitimate problem, and not turn it into a political theater. Because we do have a problem here.\"\n\nOne citizen member, Joan Mell, is Ellsworth's personal attorney. Ellsworth told the Montana State News Bureau he knew Mell as a friend before she became his lawyer, and he found her to be a reasonable and qualified applicant for the committee.\n\nAsked if there was any issue with appointing a friend to such an important committee, Ellsworth said no.\n\n\"I'm not concerned there's an appearance of anything, because I think when you do good work and you're doing it for the right reasons, friendships happen,\" he said.\n\nThe committee is preparing to meet next month and may soon begin requesting judges and justices to appear and testify. Any early candidates for that request -- or subpoenas, if the requests are not answered -- have not yet been identified. Lawmakers have the power to issue subpoenas to compel people to appear before them or produce information, a power they used to much consternation early in their conflict with the judiciary.\n\n\"Everybody's on the table,\" he said.\n\nAnd while judges and justices have ultimately decided the disputes brought to court over legislation, Ellsworth seemed hesitant to the idea of bringing in the Attorney General's Office, which represents the Legislature in litigation.\n\n\"If I feel that the Attorney General's Office has information that's relevant to this and pertinent then I will ask him to come here,\" he said. \"Wherever the information leads us, and whoever needs to come in here, will be here.\"\n\nOne group Ellsworth has yet to wrangle into the room is the Democrats he appointed to the committee. Repeatedly, Ellsworth has chastised the minority party for their absence, leaving, by his count, 40-45% of voters unrepresented during the committee discussions.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said this week Democrats will debate the merits of any legislation produced by the committee when the matter comes to the session next year.\n\n\"We'll have the opportunity at that point to weigh in, just like we do on any other legislation,\" Flowers said. \"I think we would be doing a disservice to our constituents by participating in a committee that drew their conclusions before they met. That to me is a definition of a sham effort that's not truly trying to explore an issue to determine, assess whether there's a problem.\"\n\nThe state Capitol came alive this week as current lawmakers and legislative candidates gathered for a blend of presentations on the process and updates on legislative projects set out in the last session.\n\nThe event gives incoming lawmakers a chance to see the capitol and get a sense of the big-picture ideas they'll have to grapple with in six months. Come January, many lawmakers will be engaging in that GOP's dispute with the judicial branch for the first time.\n\nLukas Schubert, an 18-year-old hardline Republican, ousted the moderate Rep. Tony Brockman of Kalispell in their primary last month. He's made the judiciary a focus of his campaign and, while primary vote tallies are not precise indicators of the November's electorate, garnered 1,500 votes in a contested GOP primary while Beth Sibert, the Democrat running for the district, collected about 500.\n\nSchubert, like many in the Legislature's majority party, alleges Democratic partisanship of the Supreme Court, particularly Justice Ingrid Gustafson. In 2022, he volunteered on the campaign of Republican Public Service Commissioner James Brown, who challenged Gustafson.\n\nAbortion rights advocates aided Gustafson's reelection with independent expenditures supporting her campaign. Gustafson earlier this year authored the court's opinion allowing an abortion access ballot initiative to begin gathering signatures. Schubert, in an interview at the Capitol this week, drew a short line between the campaign finances and the Supreme Court's decision on the ballot issue.\n\n\"If these guys are going to be blatant liberals, they should at least file as a Democrat,\" Schubert said.\n\nLegislators began talking about making judicial elections in Montana into partisan affairs months ago, a proposal that appears to have potential in Ellsworth's judicial reform committee.\n\nAsked what other measures he would support in the GOP's new legislative focus on the judicial branch, Schubert leapt over the idea of recusal laws to an item not yet spoken aloud by members of the select judicial committee.\n\n\"I want impeachment,\" he said, later adding lawmakers should consider any options available to them.\n\nLike many legislators on the select judicial committee and in the Legislature at large, Schubert does not have a legal background. He said his window into legal proceedings is looking at campaign finances.\n\nCora Neumann, a Democrat, is also not a lawyer. She ran unopposed in the primary for a Bozeman Senate district and piled up 3,000 votes, while 2,000 votes went to the unopposed Republican Tyler Rogers.\n\nNeumann likewise has kept tabs on the inter-branch conflict by way of watching the legal proceedings over legislation play out. In the district in which she's running, people speak differently about the courts than how Schubert's conversations have gone.\n\n\"The general perception is that Republican legislators are attempting to take away Montanans' freedoms, and those bills, or those laws, are being struck down,\" she said. \"I don't think it needs to be political. I think the facts are that we have a judicial branch for a reason. The founding fathers established three branches because we need checks and balances.\"\n\nNeumann said people she's spoken with are feeling fatigue from the constant drum of Republicans casting the courts as liberals in nonpartisan robes.\n\nIn 2022, Republicans made no secret of their support for Brown's campaign. The endorsements by statewide conservatives came early and Brown consistently appeared alongside Republicans on the campaign trail.\n\nStill 54% of voters sent Gustafson back to the bench and did so in the same election Montanans voted in a Republican supermajority at the state Legislature.\n\n\"Any whisper around trying to make the judiciary partisan goes so hard against Montanans way of living,\" Neumann said. \"People are just sick of this like, you're on which side? And if you're on that side, I'm not going to talk to you. It's just not the way this state has ever been.\"\n\nSeaborn Larson has worked for the Montana State News Bureau since 2020.

Class AA tried and then quickly abandoned a divisional softball tournament following a one-year trial in 2021.\n\nToby Robinson, who is the activities director at Belgrade, said all of the classification's AD's agreed to do away with divisional tournaments during a summer meeting last week in Butte to help address budget shortfalls that school districts have incurred around the state.\n\n\"We're losing teaching positions or not renewing when someone retires because we have shortfalls. Bonds aren't passing and levies aren't passing, so what about athletics? Why isn't athletics giving up anything?\" he said. \"So we were asked by the superintendents to come together and come up with solutions on how we can save money, and so this of some of the things that we did.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

That includes paying for lodging, food, gas and bus drivers among other costs.\n\nThus, it made sense to eliminate the tournaments.\n\n\"Is it ideal? No. Is it absolutely the thrill of a divisional tournament? No,\" said Robinson. \"I even miss it in softball. We had it the first year in AA here (in Belgrade), us and Billings West in that last game, that was really exciting. No matter who's in it it's really exciting to have a softball tournament for divisionals and earn your way to state.\n\n\"It's not ideal, but I understand this is the times. We live in a pretty expensive state, not just the Gallatin Valley, but everywhere and bonds and levies are not passing for school districts. Certain school districts are not renewing contracts, and shortfalls means that everybody needs to chip in and do their part in athletics.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, basketball and volleyball would have the same postseason format. The top two seeds, based on regular season conference standings, would automatically qualify for state, while the No. 7 and 8 seeds would be eliminated.\n\nThe No. 3 and 4 seeds would host the No. 6 and 5 seeds, respectively, with the winners advancing. The top four teams from the Eastern AA and Western AA qualify will continue to qualify for state.\n\nThose \"play-in\" games would be held on the Tuesday the week prior to the state tournament. Robinson said Belgrade's volleyball team would have a 22-match schedule and basketball a 19-game season.\n\nThere are also significant changes to softball under the proposal. The state tournament would be reduced from a 12-team field to eight, and play-in series will determine the final two seeds from the east and the west.\n\nLike basketball and volleyball, softball's top two team teams in the conference standings will automatically qualify for state while the No. 7 and 8 seeds will be eliminated. The remaining seeds will play the best 2 out of 3 series on a single day to determine the rest of the field.\n\n\"It's an interesting way to do it. It's not a one and done,\" said Robinson.\n\nThe No. 3 and 4 seeds would host the No. 6 and 5 seeds, respectively. Those games would be held the week prior to the state tournament.\n\nThe playoff series is a format AA has previously used and Robinson said there weren't any concerns raised about athletes potentially playing three consecutive games on the same day.\n\n\"In softball you don't have the arm issues like you have in baseball,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, softball would play a 20-game schedule (down from 22) and the 15-run rule after three innings will be added to postseason games.\n\nIn other discussion:\n\n* The MHSA is planning to move the minimum times for state cross country meets to 22 minutes for boys and 27 for girls.\n\n* Wrestling weights are moving from 13 to 14 under MHSA guidelines. In AA, the top 14 scoring wrestlers for each team will be counted for the state tournament.\n\nDue to an increase of size with boys and girls both competing at the same time, the all-class state tournament will now begin on Thursday afternoon beginning in 2025. In addition, the MHSA is looking at moving the tournament back one week in 2026.\n\n* The MHSA is looking at Wednesday-Friday format for the all-class state volleyball tournament whenever Montana State University's football team has a home game. It will not impact the 2024 tournament.\n\n* All AA schools, with the possible exception of Belgrade and Butte High, have committed to not allowing eighth grade participation in high school sports or activities.\n\n0 Comments Locations Belgrade Get in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of

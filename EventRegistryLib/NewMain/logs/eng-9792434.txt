This decision came hours after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country amid escalating violence. The decision to release Khaleda Zia was made during a meeting with opposition party members. A press statement from the president's office confirmed, \"Shahabuddin had decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately.\" The meeting included army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman, the heads of the navy and air force, and top leaders from opposition parties including the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nKhaleda Zia, the arch-rival of Hasina, was jailed in 2018 after being sentenced to 17 years in prison for a graft case.\n\nKhaleda Zia, born on August 15, 1945, in Bengal's Jalpaiguri, is the chief of the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Her political career began after the assassination of her husband Ziaur Rahman, who was President of Bangladesh from 1977 to 1981 and formed the BNP in 1978.\n\nIn 1991, Khaleda Zia became the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, making her the second female prime minister in the Muslim world after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. She served as prime minister again from 2001 to 2006. The 2007 elections were postponed due to political violence and infighting, leading to a military takeover of the caretaker government. During this interim rule, Zia and her two sons faced corruption charges.\n\nKhaleda Zia, now facing multiple health issues, is currently confined to a hospital. She has frequently traveled overseas for medical treatment.\n\nThe release of Khaleda Zia marks a significant development in Bangladesh's political landscape, following the resignation and departure of Sheikh Hasina. The decision reflects ongoing political tensions and the need for stability in the country.\n\nEarlier this year, a senior leader of Khaleda Zia's party claimed that she is nearly on her \"deathbed\" due to being denied medical treatment abroad. She was hospitalized in June after falling suddenly ill.\n\nBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir alleged that Hasina's actions stem from a \"personal political vendetta.\"\n\nKhaleda, who served as prime minister from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006, fell ill while in Old Dhaka Central Jail but did not receive medical treatment there, he stated.\n\nThe neighboring country has descended into uncertainty following massive street protests over job quotas, leading Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee. According to diplomatic sources quoted by TOI, she has reached India and is en route to London.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziaur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ziaur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benazir Bhutto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dhaka_Central_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Dhaka Central Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Fakhrul_Islam_Alamgir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112308736,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1176663,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792434", "eventUri": "eng-9792434", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 838, "textEnd": 847}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

In 2018, she was found guilty of corruption and given a 17-year prison sentence.\n\nShe and Hasina had a long-standing feud and she was accused of abusing her position of authority by stealing almost USD250,000 in donations intended for a trust for an orphanage, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nThe BNP has claimed that the cases were made up to prevent Zia from entering politics; Hasina's administration, however, refuted these claims.\n\nBangladesh is facing a fluid political situation with Sheikh Hasina, on August 5, tendering her resignation from her post in the wake of mounting protests. The protests, led majorly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, took the shape of anti-government protests.\n\nHasina arrived in India on Monday evening and it is not clear if she will stay in Delhi or move to another location.\n\nMeanwhile, in Dhaka, leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have proposed an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, in a bid to address Bangladesh's ongoing challenge.

Her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled Bangladesh on Monday (August 5) to India after over a month of deadly student protests over the quota system for government jobs.\n\nAfter Hasina stepped down and left the South Asian country, President Mohammed Shahabuddin, after a meeting with Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, announced the release of the key opposition leader Zia.\n\nThe president said in a statement that it was \"decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately\".\n\nParliament dissolved\n\nBangladesh's president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of student protesters who led demonstrations that ousted longtime ruler Sheikh Hasina, a statement read. \"The president has dissolved parliament,\" Shiplu Zaman, press secretary of President Mohammed Shahabuddin, said in a statement.\n\nWho is Khaleda Zia?\n\nKhaleda Zia, 78, is the chairperson of the BNP, who served as Bangladesh's prime minister multiple times. In fact, she became Bangladesh's first female prime minister in 1991. Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in undivided India in August 1945.\n\nHer foray into politics happened after her husband, Lt General Ziaur Rahman, a military officer, was assassinated in 1981. Rahman, who became Bangladesh's president in 1977, was killed in office.\n\nDuring her first stint as Bangladesh's PM, Zia led the country through a period of civil unrest. As she was short of a majority, the BNP leader formed the government with the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami. She returned to power in 1996 for a second term, however, her government survived for only 12 days. She stepped down after installing a caretaker government on the demand of the opposition parties led by the Awami League.\n\nFresh elections were held in June of 1996, leading to Awami League's Hasina being elected to power.\n\nZia and Hasina led the governments in Bangladesh alternatively for years. Their political rivalry \"polarised\" Bangladesh politics.\n\nZia made a comeback in 2001 and served as the prime minister for a five-year term. She resigned in 2006 after her tenure ended and was arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of power a year later.\n\nHer younger son Arafat was also arrested for the same offence. Zia's other son, Tarique Rahman, was also in prison at the time. Tarique fled to the United Kingdom later in 2008.\n\nZia was jailed in 2018 for graft after being sentenced to 17 years. Her supporters had decried her arrest, saying the corruption charges were a politically motivated attempt to keep her out of power.\n\nIn March 2020, the Hasina government allowed Zia to walk out of jail over health issues. The then Bangladeshi law and justice minister Anisul Haq said she was released on the condition that \"she remains in her Dhaka residence to receive treatment and does not go abroad.\"\n\nZia has been under house arrest since then. Over the last few months, she has been admitted to the hospital multiple times due to worsening health.\n\nIn June, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir claimed Zia was on her \"deathbed\" after she was rushed to the hospital.\n\nZia's release could be a boon for her party which has lost popularity in recent years. A power vacuum was created in the BNP after she was arrested in 2018. Her son, Tarique, who also faces corruption cases in his homeland, is the vice chairman of the party.\n\nBNP's Alamgir became the face of the opposition on the ground. However, the leadership of the party remains with Zia's family.\n\nNobel winner Yunus asked to lead caretaker govt\n\nStudent leaders in Bangladesh has urged country's Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead the interim government after Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India.\n\nIn a video posted on social media early Tuesday morning, Nahid Islam, one of the key coordinators of the students movement, said that Prof Yunus has agreed to take on this crucial responsibility at the call of the student community to save the country, the Daily Star newspaper reported.\n\n\"We took 24 hours to announce a framework for the interim government. However, considering the emergency situation, we are announcing it now,\" Nahid said. \"We have decided that the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus, who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser,\" said Nahid, flanked by two other coordinators.\n\nEarlier, in his reaction to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus described Bangladesh as a \"free country\" after Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign as prime minister and flee the country after weeks of violent anti-quota protests that finally demanded her resignation.\n\n\"We were an occupied country as long as she (Sheikh Hasina) was there. She was behaving like an occupation force, a dictator, a general, controlling everything. Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated,\" Muhammad Yunus said in an interview.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, who has been charged by the Awami League government in over 190 cases, accused the fleeing Sheikh Hasina of destroying her father, 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rehman's legacy.\n\nThe economist is known for his expertise in microfinance and has his work had lifted millions of people out of poverty. Once seen as Sheikh Hasina's potential rival to the country's prime ministership, she accused him of \"sucking blood\" from the poor.\n\nThe 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner was convicted on charges of embezzling $2 million (more than 16 crore rupees) from the workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, one of several firms he founded.\n\nYunus said violence and vandalism by the protesters is the expression of anger against Sheikh Hasina and \"an expression of damage she has done\". He also expressed hope that the same students and young people will be leading Bangladesh in the right direction in future.\n\nYunus explained that seething anger against Sheikh Hasina could not be expressed in a political way due to a series of rigged general elections. \"So that came out as a simple demand for quota changes. It immediately caught up because the government behaved the same way, attacking them rather than listening to them because they are not in a listening mood at all,\" Yunus said.\n\nWestern powers call for calm, democratic transition\n\nWestern powers called Monday for calm in Bangladesh after long-ruling leader Sheikh Hasina fled, with the United States saluting the military for forming an interim government rather than cracking down further on protesters.\n\nSheikh Hasina, who had particularly close relations with regional power India, enjoyed a mostly cooperative relationship with the West during her 15 years in power but had increasingly drawn criticism for her authoritarian turn.\n\nThe United States called on all sides in Bangladesh to \"refrain from further violence\" as bullet-ridden bodies were strewn across hospital floors and looting swept the capital Dhaka.\n\n\"Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\nHasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father, had sought to quell a nationwide uprising that started with student-led protests against job quotas. Nearly 100 people were killed on Sunday as calls grew for her to step down.\n\nMiller said that the United States had seen reports that the army refused pressure to crack down further on student-led demonstrations.\n\n\"If it is true in fact that the army resisted calls to crack down on lawful protesters, that would be a positive development,\" he said.\n\n\"We welcome the announcement of an interim government and urge any transition be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh's laws,\" he said.\n\nAsked if the military should choose the next leadership, Miller said, \"We want to see the Bangladeshi people decide the future Bangladeshi government.\"\n\n- Call for UN-led probe -\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition\" as well as a \"full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence,\" his spokesman Farhan Haq said.\n\nBangladesh's former colonial power Britain called for the United Nations to take the lead in an investigation.\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks,\" Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement.\n\nThe European Union also called for \"calm and restraint.\"\n\n\"It is vital that an orderly and peaceful transition towards a democratically elected government is ensured, in full respect of human rights and democratic principles,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.\n\nCanada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said her country \"condemns the human rights violations, deaths, torture, arbitrary arrests and lethal force\" used in response to the protests.\n\n\"During this transition, we urge all parties to respect and uphold democratic institutions and processes and the rule of law,\" Joly said in a statement.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from regional governments to the fall of Hasina, who had sought a delicate balancing act of enjoying support from India while maintaining strong relations with China.\n\nIndian media said that Hasina flew to a military airbase near New Delhi.\n\nA top-level source said she wanted to transit on to London, but it was unclear if she would be allowed.\n\nThe United States in the past praised Hasina's economic track record and saw her as a partner on priorities such as countering Islamist extremism and sheltering Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar.\n\nBut Washington more recently criticized her for autocratic tendencies and imposed visa sanctions over concerns on democracy.", "source": {"uri":

With Sheikh Hasina quitting the PM's post, many names are surfacing who could replace her. And one of them is that of Hasina's and her Awami League's arch rival Begum Khaleda Zia. Khaleda Zia heads the the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the key opposition leader of the country. Even though she was elected thrice, she could run the government two times. Speculations are rife that she may aim to be the PM again.\n\nKhaleda Zia was the first female prime minister of Bangladesh and second female prime minister in the Muslim world, after Benazir Bhutto.\n\nAfter Hasina fled the country and the Army chief announced formation of an interim government, Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin issued orders for the release of Khaleda Zia.\n\nSome key facts about Khaleda Zia:\n\nBorn in Jalpaiguri in undivided Dinajpur District of India in 1945, Khaleda Zia was the third of five children of tea-businessman father Iskandar Ali Majumder.\n\nHer husband, Lt Gen Ziaur Rehman, was the President of Bangladesh from 1977 before he was assassinated in 1981.\n\nIn 1991, Zia became the first woman prime minister of Bangladesh after the BNP party won in the 1991 general elections. There was chaos in the country and she formed the government with the help of the Jamaat-e-Islami\n\nIn 1996, her party won a second term, but the elections were boycotted by main opposition parties who called it unfair. She served briefly for 12 days as fresh elections were called. The next round of elections was won by Awami League and Hasina became the prime minister for the first time.\n\nIn 2001, Khaleda Zia's party came to power again forming an alliance with four parties. She stepped down in 2006 and was arrested for corruption a year later. The former premier had denied the charges and termed the verdict as politically-motivated. She has been elected to five separate parliamentary constituencies in the general elections of 1991, 1996 and 2001.\n\nAfter her term ended in 2006, the elections were delayed due to infighting. A caretaker government was formed, which was taken over by the military. Zia had her two sons were charged with corruption. She stepped down in 2006 and was arrested. She had denied the charges and said that the ruling was politically-motivated.\n\nIn 2018, Khaleda Zia was sentenced to 17 years of jail for graft. She could not contest the elections due to her conviction later that year. Zia was shifted to a hospital for medical treatment in April 2019. She has been in Dhaka Central Jail since 2018.\n\nBangladesh Political Crisis: Full Coverage\n\nAssassinations, military coups: Timeline of Bangladesh's violent political history\n\nVideo: Bangladesh

Notably, Khaleda Zia is the chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the rival of Hasina's Awami League. Khaleda Zia, 78, is currently in poor health and hospitalized following her 2018 conviction for corruption, which resulted in a 17-year prison sentence.\n\nWho is Khaleda Zia?\n\nKhaleda Zia is the head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the primary opposition party in Bangladesh. She was born in Jalpaiguri, Bengal, on August 15, 1945. Her political career started after her husband, Ziaur Rahman, who led Bangladesh as president from 1977 to 1981 and established the BNP in 1978, was assassinated.\n\nIn 1991, Zia became the first female Prime Minister of Bangladesh and the second woman to lead a Muslim-majority country, following Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. She served a second term as Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006. However, political turmoil and violence led to the postponement of the January 2007 elections and a military takeover of the caretaker government.\n\nDuring the interim government's rule, Zia and her two sons were charged with corruption. Due to various health issues, Zia is currently hospitalised and frequently travels abroad for medical treatment.\n\nHasina leaves Bangladesh, seeks asylum\n\nAfter months of intense protests that claimed the lives of over 300 people, Hasina was removed from office as prime minister of Bangladesh on Monday. The Bangladesh Army issued Hasina a 45-minute ultimatum to leave the country, and she departed for India. After landing at the Hindan Airbase in Ghaziabad, Hasina is expected to remain in India until the UK gives her refuge.\n\nThe UK government has yet to confirm whether it will grant political asylum to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

A consensus was also reached at the meeting that no community should be harmed in any way.\n\nEarlier, as Hasina left for India, Bangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman confirmed the news of her resignation and said that an interim government will be formed soon to run the country. It was reported that over 100 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in the clashes that took place between police and the protesters on Sunday. Bangladesh Unrest: Dhaka's Shahjalal International Airport Temporarily Closed Amid Massive Protests in Country.\n\n\"With yesterday's count, the death toll in anti-government protests crossed 300 in just three weeks, making it the bloodiest period in the history of Bangladesh's civil movement,\" the country's leading daily 'The Daily Star' reported.\n\nThe student-led non-cooperation movement put immense pressure on the government led by Prime Minister Hasina over the past many weeks. The students had been protesting against a 30 per cent reservation in government jobs for relatives of freedom fighters who wrested independence for Bangladesh from Pakistan in a bloody civil war in 1971 in which, according to Dhaka officials, three million people were killed in the genocide by Pakistani troops and their supporters.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court slashed the reservations to 5 per cent, student leaders put the protests on hold, but the demonstrations flared up again because the students said the government ignored their call to release all their leaders, making the resignation of PM Hasina their primary demand.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type":

In the past, it was Sheikh Hasina opposing Khaleda Zia, and now it's Khaleda Zia's party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), opposing Sheikh Hasina.\n\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following weeks of violent protests and has left the country. Army Chief Waqar-uz-Zaman announced that an interim government will be formed.\n\nStudents protested in the streets for several weeks to remove Sheikh Hasina from office. On Sunday, there was massive violence in Bangladesh, resulting in hundreds of deaths. On Monday, the protesters also planned a long march to Dhaka.\n\nThe situation was so tense that the army was deployed across the country to stop the protesters, but reports say the army didn't try to stop them. Earlier, the Army Chief stated that the military always stands with the people.\n\nSheikh Hasina was elected Prime Minister for the fifth time in January. Her party, the Awami League, won 224 out of 300 seats in the general elections. However, these elections were considered controversial, and the opposition boycotted them. Sheikh Hasina's resignation in less than seven months brings back memories of Khaleda Zia's resignation 28 years ago.\n\nThe stories of Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina's resignations are quite similar. In the past, it was Sheikh Hasina opposing Khaleda Zia, and now it's Khaleda Zia's party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), opposing Sheikh Hasina.\n\nSheikh Hasina recently compared the BNP to a terrorist organization and accused it of inciting students.\n\nKhaleda Zia was accused of rigging the 1996 elections, which were held on February 15 that year. The opposition boycotted the elections, and Khaleda Zia took the oath as Prime Minister on February 19. To remove her from office, the opposition, led by Sheikh Hasina, began a non-cooperation movement. On March 31, Khaleda Zia was forced to resign.\n\nAfter Khaleda Zia resigned, the President dissolved Parliament and appointed former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Muhammad Habibur Rahman as the interim Prime Minister.\n\nNow, looking at 2024, general elections were held in Bangladesh in January. Fifteen opposition parties, including the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, boycotted the election, resulting in only 40 percent voter turnout. Sheikh Hasina's party, the Awami League, won 224 out of 300 seats in Parliament. The opposition accused the elections of being rigged.\n\nIn the 1996 elections, Khaleda Zia's BNP won 278 out of 300 seats. When she announced her resignation, Khaleda Zia accused the opposition of ruining the economy.\n\nHowever, when Khaleda Zia returned to power, and a movement led by Sheikh Hasina was active across the country, government employees joined in. They went on strike, and Khaleda Zia's photos were removed from many offices.\n\nOn the day Khaleda Zia resigned, Sheikh Hasina's party instructed its members to surround the President's House. The Awami League demanded that it remain surrounded until a neutral interim government was formed.\n\nThat day, all of Bangladesh was on high alert. The army was stationed outside the homes of Khaleda Zia and 27 ministers of her government.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simran_rajpal@news24online.com", "name": "Simran Rajpal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Habibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Habibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Khaleda-Zia-and-sheikh-hasina.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792434", "eventUri": "eng-9792434", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-15", "textStart": 1667, "textEnd": 1678}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-19", "textStart": 1781, "textEnd": 1792}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 1896, "textEnd": 1904}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Khaleda Zia has appealed for calm among the populace during these tumultuous times. \"I urge everyone to remain calm and avoid violence,\" she said through a press release issued by Shamsuddin Didar, an official from the BNP chairperson's press wing, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune.\n\nThe Bangladesh President's order for release stated, \"The meeting held unanimously decided to release BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia. Additionally, it was decided to release all detainees who were arrested in various cases related to the student against discrimination movement and recent incidents. There was also a strong consensus to ensure that communal harmony is not disrupted in any way.\"\n\nAn ongoing curfew has been announced, effective from Monday midnight until 6 am on Tuesday, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR). From Tuesday morning, all government, semi-government, autonomous, semi-autonomous, private institutions, factories, schools, colleges, madrasas, universities, and all educational institutions in Bangladesh will remain open, stated an ISPR press release cited by the Dhaka Tribune.\n\nThe unrest on Monday resulted in at least 56 fatalities, with the majority suffering from bullet wounds. Dhaka Medical College Hospital received 44 bodies, while police reported 11 deaths in the capital and one in Chittagong, according to AFP.\n\nFollowing nationwide protests, Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday, leading to the dissolution of Parliament and the formation of an interim government.

It was decided that the army would take steps to normalise the chaotic situation.\n\nALSO READ | Bangladesh Protests: Sheikh Hasina's Son Rules Out Her Political Comeback, Says 'She's Very Disappointed'\n\nThe United States welcomed the announcement of the interim government as it urged that any transition of power be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh's laws.\n\nCommenting on the situation, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said, \"We have seen the announcement that Prime Minister Hasina has resigned from her position and departed Bangladesh. We are monitoring the situation carefully. The United States stands with the people of Bangladesh. We urge all parties to refrain from further violence.

We are deeply saddened about the reports of human rights abuses, casualties, and injuries over the weekend in the past weeks,\" he added.\n\nIn light of the ongoing violence, Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-discrimination student movement, called upon students to prevent looting. Speaking to Channel 24, he urged protesting students to maintain peace and protect national properties. \"We must save national properties. Let no one get the chance to loot, taking advantage of the students,\" Islam said, as quoted by Prothom Alo.\n\nHe also called for the reform of existing repressive acts and the formation of an interim government with participation from students, teachers, civil society, and others, to ensure a fair transfer of power to the people's representatives.\n\nKhaleda Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006. Notably, she was the first female prime minister of Bangladesh and the second female prime minister in the Muslim world, following Benazir Bhutto. Khaleda Zia is the widow of former president Ziaur Rahman and has been the chairperson and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) since 1984, a party founded by her husband in 1978.\n\nThe BNP Chairperson was imprisoned on February 8, 2018, following her conviction in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Khaleda Zia was released on conditional bail on March 25, 2020, for six months. According to the government's executive order, she was required to stay at her residence and receive medical treatment in Dhaka.\n\nIt must be noted that the veteran Bangladesh politicianaged 79, has been dealing with health issues and was said to be in a critical condition in the month of June this year.

Her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled Bangladesh on Monday (August 5) after over a month of deadly student protests over the quota system for government jobs.\n\nAfter Hasina stepped down and left the South Asian country, President Mohammed Shahabuddin, reportedly after a meeting with Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, announced the release of the key opposition leader Zia.\n\nThe president's press said in a statement that it was \"decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately\".\n\nBut who is Khaleda Zia? Why was she arrested? We explain.\n\nWho is Khaleda Zia?\n\nZia, 78, is the chairperson of the BNP, who served as Bangladesh's prime minister multiple times.\n\nIn fact, she became Bangladesh's first female prime minister in 1991. Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in undivided India in August 1945.\n\nHer foray into politics happened after her husband, Lt General Ziaur Rahman, a ruthless military officer, was assassinated in 1981. Rahman, who became Bangladesh's president in 1977, was killed in office.\n\nHe had founded the BNP in 1978.\n\nDuring her first stint as Bangladesh's PM, Zia led the country through a period of civil unrest. As she was short of a majority, the BNP leader formed the government with the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami, as per NDTV.\n\nShe returned to power in 1996 for a second term, however, her government survived for only 12 days. She stepped down after installing a caretaker government on the demand of the opposition parties led by the Awami League, reported Deutsche Welle (DW).\n\nFresh elections were held in June of 1996, leading to Awami League's Hasina being elected to power.\n\nZia and Hasina led the governments in Bangladesh alternatively for years. Their political rivalry \"polarised\" Bangladesh politics, as per Associated Press.\n\nZia made a comeback in 2001 and served as the prime minister for a five-year term. She resigned in 2006 after her tenure ended and was arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of power a year later.\n\nHer younger son Arafat was also arrested for the same offence. Zia's other son, Tarique Rahman, was also in prison at the time. Tarique fled to the United Kingdom later, where he has has since 2008.\n\nZia's arrest in 2018\n\nZia was jailed in 2018 for graft after being sentenced to 17 years. Her supporters had decried her arrest, saying the corruption charges were a politically motivated attempt to keep her out of power.\n\nAsif Nazrul, a law professor at the University of Dhaka, told DW last year, \"Her trial was very controversial. Even at the appeal stage, her punishment was doubled by the high court, which is very rare in Bangladesh or many other common law states.\"\n\n\"She is the most popular leader in Bangladesh in terms of the constituency she won personally in the past parliamentary elections. This incumbent [Hasina] government could not have confronted her popularity except by detaining her,\" Nazrul added.\n\nIn March 2020, the Hasina government allowed Zia to walk out of jail over health issues. The then Bangladeshi law and justice minister Anisul Haq said she was released on the condition that \"she remains in her Dhaka residence to receive treatment and does not go abroad.\"\n\nZia has been under house arrest since then. Over the last few months, she has been admitted to the hospital multiple times due to worsening health.\n\nIn June, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir claimed Zia was on her \"deathbed\" after she was rushed to the hospital.\n\nAccusing the Hasina government of harbouring a \"personal political vendetta\" against her political rival, he said at the time, \"It's our misfortune that our leader Khaleda Zia is now in critical condition on her deathbed without receiving any (necessary) medical treatment (abroad).\"\n\nALSO READ: Why Sheikh Hasina's ouster from Bangladesh is bad news for India\n\nWhat does Zia's release mean?\n\nZia's release could be a boon for her party which has lost popularity in recent years. A power vacuum was created in the BNP after she was arrested in 2018. Her son, Tarique, who also faces corruption cases in his homeland, is the vice chairman of the party.\n\nMichael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told DW in 2023 that the BNP tried to boost Tarique's image in Bangladesh amid the absence of his mother in the political scene, perhaps for a \"transition of power\".\n\n\"But it's difficult, even in a dynastic party, to transfer leadership duties to someone based abroad and far away. Not to mention, when you have someone who has been abroad for 15 years, there will be concerns that they are out of touch with ground realities, and that's not the perception you want people to have about the next party leader,\" he pointed out.\n\nBNP's Alamgir became the face of the opposition on the ground. However, the leadership of the party remains with Zia's family.\n\nThe former PM has urged people to remain calm and refrain from violence amid the current situation. Her son has also called for peace in the country.\n\nNow that Zia is going to be free, and if she chooses to re-enter politics amid the current upheaval, the BNP could benefit. With Hasina out of the picture and widespread anger towards her Awami League, the stage is set for the opposition to make the most of it and win the public.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

A night of deadly violence on Sunday killed close to 100 and a curfew to quash protests was called.\n\nEarlier on Monday, General Waker-Uz-Zaman said an interim government would be formed and the deaths in the course of the weeks-long protests would be investigated.\n\n\"I promise you all we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility, and I assure you to not get disheartened,\" the general said.\n\nThe military also said it would lift the curfew at dawn on Tuesday and open offices, factories, schools, and colleges from 6am on Tuesday (00:00 GMT).\n\nReporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera's Tanvir Chowdhury said that despite the violence, arrests and curfew, people on the streets were jubilant over Hasina's exit.\n\n\"Just a few minutes ago, an army patrol told protesters to go home, that the army was with them and that they should let the roads clear. They were saying the protesters were all protected and not to worry. But people are still planning to stay on the streets even though it's not as crowded,\" he said.\n\nChowdhury added that what happens next in the country \"depends on how the interim government is formed, who its members are and how acceptable they are to the public\".\n\nThe military has a \"very tough job ahead,\" Irene Khan, a UN special rapporteur, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"We are all hoping that the transition would be peaceful and that there will be accountability for all the human rights violations that have taken place.\"__Al Jazeera News", "source": {"uri": "voiceofvienna.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "voiceofvienna.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irene Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_special_rapporteur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations special rapporteur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://voiceofvienna.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Khaleda-Zia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792434", "eventUri": "eng-9792434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

This decision was made in consultation with opposition members, reaching a consensus to free the Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson. The meeting included Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the heads of the navy and air force, and senior leaders from opposition parties, including the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami. Here's what we know about the former Bangladesh PM Zia.\n\nBorn on August 15, 1945, in Jalpaiguri, Bengal, Zia entered politics after the assassination of her husband, Ziaur Rahman. Rahman was the President of Bangladesh from 1977 to 1981 and founded the BNP in 1978. In 1991, Zia made history as Bangladesh's first female PM and the second woman to lead a Muslim-majority nation. She served another term from 2001 to 2006. Considered a strong opponent of Hasina, Zia is the leader of the main opposition party, the BNP.\n\nPolitical unrest and violence led to the delay of the 2007 elections, resulting in a military takeover of the interim government. During this period, Zia and her two sons were accused of corruption. In 2018, she was found guilty and sentenced to a 17-year prison term. Now aged 78, Zia is hospitalized and often travels overseas for medical treatment. The rivalry between Zia and Hasina -- often referred to as the \"Battle of Begums\" -- has polarized Bangladesh politics for years.\n\nHasina was removed from her position as Prime Minister following months of large-scale protests that resulted in over 300 fatalities. After being given a 45-minute ultimatum by the Bangladesh Army, Hasina fled to India, where she is expected to remain until the United Kingdom grants her asylum. The UK government has not yet confirmed whether it will provide political asylum to the former Bangladeshi Prime Minister.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziaur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ziaur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l32520240806103359.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792434", "eventUri": "eng-9792434", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 563, "textEnd": 572}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Her stance was reiterated by BNP's secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuyian.\n\nKhaleda Zia lamented that Sheikh Hasina was not allowing insurgents easy transit to India through Bangladesh. It is interesting to note that BNP came to power\n\nAccording to reports, insurgent outfits such as the Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), All Tripura Tigers Force (ATTF) or National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) received arms training in Bangladesh under the supervision of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).\n\n\"ISI exerts on north-east militant groups. This effort has been greatly boosted with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) assuming power in Dhaka in 2001. Dominated by policy-makers who advocate an anti-India line, Khaleda Zia's government has been a silent abettor of the ULFA-NDFB-ATTF-NLFT-ISI nexus,\" wrote leading strategic analyst Nitin A Gokhale in August 2005.\n\nBNP has been vocal about its anti-India stance.

Hasina fled to India earlier in the day after resigning.\n\nZia, born on Aug. 15, 1945, has liver disease, diabetes and heart problems, according to her doctors. She has largely remained away from politics for many years.\n\nPopularly known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.\n\nFollow the latest updates from the Bangladesh crisis, right here with DH!\n\nPlunging into politics, she became head of her husband's conservative BNP three years later, vowing to deliver on his aim of \"liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness\".\n\nShe joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad from power in 1990.\n\nBut their cooperation did not last long and the next year, Bangladesh held what has hailed as its first free election with Khaleda winning a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of Islamic political allies.\n\nIn doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh's first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto.\n\nKhaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary form of government so that power rested with the prime minister, lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.\n\nShe lost to Hasina in the 1996 elections but came back five years later. But her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.\n\nIn 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed and years later her eldest son was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP contended the charges were trumped up.\n\nAlthough Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.\n\nThe interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they

India's relations with Zia's government had strained after she refused to crack down on the extremist group United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).\n\nThe protests marked a violent chapter in Bangladesh's history and brought a tumultuous end to Hasina's 15-year-old reign, as the unrest over job quotas ballooned into a movement that called for her ouster. Hasina fled the country in haste and arrived in India on Monday evening and her resignation was announced by Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman.\n\nBangladesh is awaiting the formation of an interim government and the military has urged people to refrain from violence as it promised to resolve the \"injustice\" done to the people. More than 300 people have been killed and thousands injured in the violent protests that started in mid-July. The 78-year-old Zia was ordered to be released from house arrest after Hasina's departure.\n\n\"I call upon the people of Bangladesh to display restraint and calm in the midst of this transitional moment on our democratic path,\" Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chief of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Zia's son, said in a post on X on Tuesday. Zia is known as the arch-rival of Hasina and was sentenced to 17 years in prison in a corruption case, after which she was transferred to house arrest due to ill-health.\n\nZia was born on August 15, 1945, and was married to former military general and President Ziaur Rahman, who founded BNP, sharing two sons with him. Ziaur Rahman's rise to leadership began with founding father and first President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination and ended with his own assassination in 1981. Described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons, Zia formally entered politics after her husband's death and took over the leadership of the BNP.\n\nPromising to \"liberate Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness' after Army Chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad's military coup in 1982, Zia joined hands with Hasina, the leader of Awami League, to fight against the military rule in the country, ultimately toppling Ershad from power in 1990.\n\nHowever, their cooperation did not last long as Zia won the first free election in 1991 over Hasina after gaining the support of Islamic political allies. Zia became Bangladesh's first female PM and the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. She served as PM again from 2001 to 2006.\n\nZia's second term was marred by the rise of Islamist extremists and allegations of corruption, including an assassination attempt on Hasina in 2004 that killed 20 other people. After her term ended, the 2007 elections were postponed due to widespread violence and political instability, causing an army-backed interim government to take power. Both Hasina and Khaleda Zia were jailing on charges of corruption and abuse of power, but were eventually released.\n\nWhile India shares cordial relations with Hasina and her Awami League party, the situation is in stark contrast to that of BNP and Khaleda Zia. Even before that, her husband Ziaur Rahman had distanced his government from close ties with India, contrary to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's stance. Under Zia, anti-India activities grew significantly and the attacks on the Hindu community grew.\n\nThe BNP was also criticised for supporting and harbouring anti-India extremist elements like the ULFA on its soil. India faced challenges related to cross-border terrorism and repeatedly expressed concern over the activities of terrorist groups operating from Bangladesh. India's close ties with the Awami League also created perceptions that it was supporting Hasina's political interests and interfering in Bangladesh.\n\nOn the other hand, ties between the two neighbouring countries deepened under Hasina, who brought back political stability and cracked down on terrorist groups hostile to India. The two countries also worked on the improvement of railway, road, and inland water connectivity, boosting security and border management and the amplification of defence cooperation. India became Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner in Asia.\n\nAfter Zia's term ended and the BNP boycotted the election in 2008, her stature was largely diminished as she never regained power after that. However, the vitriolic feud with Hasina that led to the two being dubbed \"the battling Begums\" continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.\n\nTension between their two parties has often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding economic development for a poverty-stricken country of nearly 170 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods. In 2018, Zia, her eldest son and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.\n\nShe was jailed but released in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. She is suffering from liver disease, diabetes and heart problems, according to her doctors. Since then, Zia has been confined under house arrest.\n\nThe massive protests in Bangladesh were initially against the controversial quota system in government jobs, but soon spiralled into a broader agitation against the Awami League government after Hasina's 'razakar' remarks and the harsh police crackdown on protesters. While the initial protests calmed down after the Supreme Court scaled back the quotas, the recent unrest broke out as several students demanded Hasina's resignation.\n\nAfter Hasina's resignation, much of the calm has returned in the embattled country as shops and schools reopened. Noble Laureate Mohammad Yunus has agreed to be the chief adviser for the soon-to-be-formed interim government and Zia has been officially freed. President Mohammed Shahabuddin has officially dissolved the 12th Parliament formed after the January 7 election where Hasina was elected for a fourth term.\n\nArmy Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead. A BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV

The students declared they would not accept an army-led government in the country and demanded that the president dissolve the current National Parliament by 3 PM.\n\n\"The anti-discrimination student movement gave an ultimatum to Shahabuddin. If not, they will take 'severe action',\" Bangladeshi media reported. Asif Mahmood, the coordinator of the anti-discrimination student movement, issued the ultimatum in a video message on Facebook.\n\nBefore this, the President announced in his address to the nation at around 11:30 PM on Monday that the current Parliament would be dissolved as soon as possible and an interim government would be formed promptly.\n\nWhat Happened in Bangladesh?\n\nThese developments occurred as Bangladesh's Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman stated on Monday that he would form an interim government after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and fled Dhaka amid mass protests demanding her resignation.\n\nIn his address broadcast on state television, the Army Chief confirmed that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had resigned following weeks of political unrest in the country. He committed to forming an interim government and addressing the nation's pressing issues.\n\nThe army chief vowed to tackle the violence and address the economic and social turmoil affecting Bangladesh. He promised to address \"all the injustices.\"\n\n\"I give you my word that all the injustices will be addressed,\" the career infantry officer said, although it was not immediately clear if he would head the new government.\n\nThe recent unrest began as student protests against government hiring policies but escalated into broader demands for Hasina's resignation. The violence claimed at least 300 lives and prompted the army's intervention on the streets.\n\nAn aide stated that the deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the capital, Dhaka, by helicopter. Indian media reported that Sheikh Hasina flew to a military airbase near New Delhi. Thousands of people, especially students, took to the streets to celebrate, with many storming the prime minister's official residence. Protest demonstrations that started last month over government job quotas expanded into nationwide political unrest. Students have been marching on the roads of Dhaka to demand justice for around 300 people killed since last month.\n\nKhaleda Zia Released\n\nBangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Monday evening ordered the release of jailed former Prime Minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, hours after the military took control of the government following the ousting of her political rival, Sheikh Hasina.\n\nIn a statement released by the president's press team, it was announced that a high-level meeting chaired by President Shahabuddin had unanimously decided to free Khaleda Zia, the chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\n\nWest Urges Calm After Sheikh Hasina's Ouster\n\nWestern countries called for calm in Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina fled, with Washington welcoming the military's formation of an interim government rather than further crackdowns on protest demonstrators.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a \"peaceful, democratic, and orderly transition\" as well as a \"full, impartial, independent, and transparent inquiry into all acts of violence,\" his spokesperson Farhan Haq stated.\n\nLondon called for the UN to take the lead in a probe. In a statement, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that the people of Bangladesh deserve an independent UN-led investigation into the events of the last few weeks.", "source": {"uri": "khybernews.tv",

(File)\n\nThe fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh points to a big change in the country's political landscape - led by possibilities that the Awami League leader's arch-rival Khaleda Zia may again aim for power. Ms Zia, the key opposition leader who heads the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, had been elected thrice, though she could run governments for only two terms.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe jailed former premier is now set to leave the prison. Hours after Ms Hasina's ouster yesterday, Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered her release.\n\nHere are 5 points on the jailed leader:Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in undivided India. Her husband, Lt Gen Ziaur Rehman, a ruthless military officer, served as the President of Bangladesh from 1977 until he was assassinated I 1981.She became the first woman prime minister of Bangladesh in 1991, running the country through a period of serious civil unrest. Falling short of a majority, she had formed the government with the help of the Jamaa-e-Islami.Ms Zia went on to win to a second term in 1996, but the elections were boycotted and denounced as unfair by the major opposition parties, including Awami League. Her government lasted only 12 days, after which a caretaker government was installed and fresh elections were called in June. Awami League won the June elections and Ms Hasina went on to became the prime minister for the first time.Khaleda Zia returned to power five years later as an alliance of four parties led by her won the elections. She stepped down in 2006 and was arrested for corruption a year later. The former premier had denied the charges and termed the verdict as politically-motivated.In 2018, Ms Zia was convicted of corruption charges and jailed for 17 years. Her convicted left her ineligible to contests elections later that year. The BNP leader, who was in poor health, had been largely confined to hospital.Bangladesh Turmoil\n\nBangladesh saw one of its deadliest demonstrations on Sunday with nearly 100 protesters dying in clashes with cops. In the fallout, the protesters breached the Prime Minister's residence on Monday. Ms Hasina avoided a direct confrontation, having already resigned and fled the country in a military plane. The country's army chief called a press conference hours later and declared an interim government would be formed to run the country.\n\nLater in the day, Ms Hasina landed at the Hindon Air Force base in India - about 30 km from capital Delhi.

In 2018, she was found guilty of corruption and given a 17-year prison sentence.\n\nShe and Hasina had a long-standing feud, and she was accused of abusing her position of authority by stealing almost USD250,000 in donations intended for a trust for an orphanage, according to Al Jazeera. The BNP has claimed that the cases were made up to prevent Zia from entering politics; Hasina's administration, however, refuted these claims.\n\nSince last month, when protests against a government job quota turned fatal, more than 2,000 people have been jailed. The demonstrations quickly turned into a nationwide campaign for Hasina's resignation.\n\nEarlier on Monday, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, in his remarks to the press said that an interim government would be formed and the deaths in the course of the weeks-long protests would be thoroughly investigated, reported Al Jazeera.\n\n\"I promise you all we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility, and I assure you to not get disheartened,\" the general had said.\n\nThe military also announced that on Tuesday, the curfew would be lifted at dawn and that businesses, companies, schools, and institutions would open at 6 a.m. (00:00 GMT).\n\nPeople from all walks of life marched towards Chittagong, distributing sweets in celebration. After reports surfaced that Sheikh Hasina had departed from Bangladesh, people took to the streets to celebrate, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nA joyous procession began at 3 pm (local time), spreading through Muradpur, Agrabad, Dewanhat, Chowkbazar, GEC, Sholshahar, Kazir Dewri, Jamalkhan, Bahaddarhat, and every part of the city, the report said.\n\nBangladesh is facing a fluid political situation with the country's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning from her post in the wake of mounting protests. The protests, majorly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, took the shape of anti-government protests.\n\nBangladesh PM Hasina arrived in India on Monday evening after tendering her resignation in the wake of mounting protests in Dhaka. It is not clear if the Bangladeshi Prime Minister will stay in Delhi or move to another location.\n\nMeanwhile, in Dhaka, the leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have proposed an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus, in a bid to address Bangladesh's ongoing challenge.\n\nThis announcement was made in a video message released early hours of Tuesday by key student leaders Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakar Mazumdar. President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Monday night gave his nod to form an interim government to run the country.

She became Bangladesh's first woman prime minister a decade later.\n\nDespite having ruled between 1991 and 1996 and from 2001 to 2006, Zia's terms in office were marred by corruption allegations.\n\nAs part of a deal to allow Zia to resume political life, her two sons - also accused of corruption during her second term - relocated to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe announcement of her release came after the army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, was meeting student leaders to discuss the formation of an interim government that is expected to hold elections soon after it takes over.\n\nMeanwhile, the country's key police association on Tuesday apologised for actions against \"innocent students\" during the crackdown on protesters and demanded the release of its jailed officers.\n\n\"Until the security of every member of the police is secured, we are declaring a strike,\" the Bangladesh police association said in a statement.\n\nIt argued its officers had been \"forced to open fire\", and that they had been cast as the \"villain\".\n\nThe families of political prisoners jailed in Bangladesh under Hasina waited desperately for news of their relatives, as some of those missing were released.\n\nAmong the most prominent of those released on Tuesday was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, a British-educated barrister son of Mir Quasem Ali, the former leader of Jamaat-e-Islami who was hanged in 2016 after his final appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nSecurity forces during Hasina's rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters.\n\nHuman Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed more than \"600 enforced disappearances\" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 people remain unaccounted for.\n\nHasina's government denied the allegations, saying some of those reported missing drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe.\n\n\"We need answers,\" Sanjida Islam Tulee, coordinator of Mayer Daak, told the AFP news agency.

The High Court later doubled her five-year jail term.\n\nIn the same year, the same special court in Dhaka sentenced Khaleda to seven years in jail in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case.\n\nAmid the coronavirus outbreak, the government temporarily freed Khaleda from jail through an executive order suspending her sentence on March 25, 2020, with the condition that she stay in her Gulshan house and not leave the country.\n\nShe has long been battling various ailments, including liver cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and issues related to the kidneys, lungs, heart, and eyes.\n\nAlthough the government has extended the period of her conditional release on multiple occasions, it has denied BNP's every call to take her abroad for advanced treatment.\n\n\"SHE GOT EMOTIONAL\"\n\nKhaleda Zia learnt about the news of Hasina's departure from television and her doctors. \"Initially, she got very emotional but later smiled,\" a member of BNP's media cell said.\n\n\"It's not right to oppress the people. Sheikh Hasina is proof of the consequences of wrongdoings. Allah has judged her,\" Khaleda was quoted as saying by hospital staff.\n\nKhaleda was kept informed about the country's situation when the quota reform protest started last month by her doctors.\n\n\"Khaleda Zia was aware that the country's situation was deteriorating day by day. But she was very surprised to learn that Hasina was forced to resign and flee the country,\" a top BNP leader said.\n\nBNP Standing Committee Member Mirza Abbas said, \"Hasina caused great harm to Madam's life.\"\n\nAsked about her health condition, he said, \"Madam is very ill and cannot even speak properly. If she could be sent abroad for better treatment, it would be very good for her health. We are now considering it.\"\n\n\"We are hoping that Madam will return to the political field again.\"\n\nAnother BNP leader Selima Rahman told The Daily Star that Khaleda Zia was imprisoned \"in false cases and out of vindictiveness.\"\n\nBNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters, \"Whenever she [Khaleda] feels fit and healthy, she will appear in public.\"\n\nFollowing her release, BNP supporters celebrated outside the Nayapaltan party office, chanting slogans in her name.\n\nKhaleda might address the public the day she returns to her residence from the hospital,

Party spokesman AKM Wahiduzzaman told AFP Tuesday that she \"is now freed\".\n\nShe is in poor health, confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis and struggling with diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nDecades-long feud\n\nThe enmity between Zia and Hasina is known popularly in Bangladesh as the \"Battle of Begums\", with \"begum\" a Muslim honorific in South Asia for powerful women.\n\nTheir feud has its roots in the murder of Hasina's father -- the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- along with her mother, three brothers and several other relatives in a 1975 military coup.\n\nZia's husband Ziaur Rahman was then the deputy army chief and effectively took control himself three months later.\n\nHe kickstarted economic recovery in poverty-stricken Bangladesh with privatisations but was killed in another military coup in 1981.\n\nThe BNP mantle fell to his widow, then a 35-year-old mother of two young sons who was dismissed by critics as a politically inexperienced housewife.\n\nZia led opposition to dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad, boycotting sham elections in 1986 and mounting street protests.\n\nShe and Hasina joined forces to push Ershad out in a wave of protests in 1990 and then faced off in Bangladesh's first free polls.\n\nZia won and led from 1991-96, and again in 2001-2006, as she and Hasina alternated in power.\n\nMutual dislike\n\nTheir mutual dislike was blamed for a January 2007 political crisis that prompted the military to impose emergency rule and set up a caretaker government. Both were detained for more than a year.\n\nHasina won elections in December 2008 by a landslide and led uninterrupted until she fled to India in a helicopter on Monday.\n\nShe had tightened her grip on power by detaining tens of thousands of BNP members. Hundreds also disappeared.\n\nZia was convicted and jailed in 2018 on graft charges her party rejected as politically motivated.\n\nShe was later released into house arrest on condition she neither took part in politics nor went abroad for medical treatment.\n\nSon in exile\n\nZia's first cabinet was hailed for liberalising Bangladesh's economy in the early 1990s, sparking decades of growth.\n\nHowever, her second term as the premier of an Islamist-allied coalition was marked by graft allegations against her government and sons.\n\nThere was also a series of Islamist attacks, one of which killed more than 20 people and almost claimed Hasina's life.\n\nThe anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion police unit Zia created has been accused of hundreds of extrajudicial killings.\n\nHer eldest son Tarique Rahman led the BNP from exile in London while she was in jail but he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life in prison over his alleged role in a bomb attack on a Hasina rally in 2004.\n\nThe BNP says the charges were a politically motivated attempt to expel Zia's dynasty from politics.\n\nZia won respect for her resolute attitude, although her inability to compromise left her unable to cut deals with important allies at home or abroad.\n\nThat defiance extended even to the death of her youngest son from a heart attack in Malaysia in 2015.\n\nPromotedListen to the

Formation of an Interim Government\n\nFollowing Hasina's resignation, the Bangladesh Army announced the formation of an interim government to run the country.\n\nThe army chief, in a televised address, stated that the interim government would oversee the transition and ensure a peaceful and fair election.\n\n2. Release of Khaleda Zia\n\nHours after Hasina's ouster, Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered the release of Khaleda Zia, the jailed former Prime Minister and key opposition leader.\n\nKhaleda Zia, who is currently in poor health and hospitalized following her 2018 conviction for corruption, is the chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the rival of Hasina's Awami League.\n\n3. Sheikh Hasina won't be returning to politics: Son\n\nSheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, has said that his mother will not be returning to politics following her resignation and departure from Bangladesh after a 15-year tenure as Prime Minister.\n\nJoy also strongly denounced the ongoing protests, characterising them as terrorism due to the associated violence and loss of life.\n\nHe defended his mother's tenure as Prime Minister, highlighting her role in transforming Bangladesh from a failing state into one of Asia's rising tigers.\n\n4. Protesting students demand dissolution of Parliament\n\nBangladesh's protesting student leaders demanded on Tuesday that parliament be dissolved and warned of a \"strict programme\" if their deadline was not met.\n\nNahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the movement against Hasina, said in a video on Facebook with two other student leaders that parliament should be dissolved by 3 pm local time on Tuesday and asked \"revolutionary students to be ready\" if that did not happen.\n\n5. International response\n\nThe United States welcomed the announcement of an interim government and urge any transition be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh's laws.\n\nUS State Department's spokesperson Matthew Miller at the daily briefing in Washington on Monday said that they are monitoring the situation carefully.\n\n\"The United States stands with the people of Bangladesh. We urge all parties to refrain from further violence. Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead,\" he said.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres advocated for a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition.\"\n\nMeanwhile, India has said that it has been in touch with the \"authorities in Dhaka\" and expressed concerned about attacks on minority Hindu community's businesses and temples in Bangladesh.\n\nIn a statement, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the situation in Bangladesh is \"still evolving\" and that the MEA is in touch with the Indian community through its diplomatic missions.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kuldeep_negi@swarajyamag.com", "name": "Kuldeep Negi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Hasina fled to India earlier in the day after resigning.\n\nZia, born on Aug. 15, 1945, has liver disease, diabetes and heart problems, according to her doctors. She has largely remained away from politics for many years.\n\nPopularly known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.\n\nPlunging into politics, she became head of her husband's conservative BNP three years later, vowing to deliver on his aim of \"liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness\".\n\nShe joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad from power in 1990.\n\nBut their cooperation did not last long and the next year, Bangladesh held what has hailed as its first free election with Khaleda winning a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of Islamic political allies.\n\nIn doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh's first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto.\n\nKhaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary form of government so that power rested with the prime minister, lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.\n\nShe lost to Hasina in the 1996 elections but came back five years later. But her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.\n\nIn 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed and years later her eldest son was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP contended the charges were trumped up.\n\nAlthough Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.\n\nThe interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.\n\nAlthough the BNP boycotted the 2008 election and Khaleda never regained power, the vitriolic feud with Hasina that led to the two being dubbed \"the battling Begums\" continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.\n\nTension between their two parties has often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding economic development for a poverty-stricken country of nearly 170 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.\n\nIn 2018, Khaleda, her eldest son and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.\n\nShe was jailed but released in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. She has remained under house arrest since then.\n\n(Editing by Krishna N.

during violent unrest in Bangladesh on Monday as the prime minister was ousted, police and doctors said, updating an earlier toll.\n\nIt marks the deadliest day since protests began in early July, and brings the total number killed to 409, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh's president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of student protesters who led demonstrations that ousted longtime ruler Sheikh Hasina, a statement read.\n\n\"The president has dissolved parliament,\" Shiplu Zaman, press secretary of President Mohammed Shahabuddin, said in a statement.\n\nAlso, Bangladesh's uncompromising ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia has been released from years of house arrest after her bitter enemy Hasina was ousted as premier and fled as protesters stormed her palace.\n\nThe ferocious rivalry between the two women born in blood and cemented in prison has defined politics in the Muslim-majority nation for decades.\n\nZia, 78, was sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018 under Hasina's rule.\n\nHasina, 76, was ousted on Monday after mass protests, with the army chief declaring the military would form an interim government.\n\nOrders were then issued for the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as Zia.\n\nZia is chairperson of the key opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).\n\nParty spokesman A.K.M Wahiduzzaman told AFP Tuesday that she \"is now freed\".\n\nShe is in poor health, confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis and struggling with diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nREAD ALSO: At least 300 dead in Bangladesh anti-government protest -- police, doctors\n\n- Decades-long feud -\n\nThe enmity between Zia and Hasina is known popularly in Bangladesh as the \"Battle of Begums\", with \"begum\" a Muslim honorific in South Asia for powerful women.\n\nTheir feud has its roots in the murder of Hasina's father the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- along with her mother, three brothers and several other relatives in a 1975 military coup.\n\nZia's husband Ziaur Rahman was then the deputy army chief and effectively took control himself three months later.\n\nHe kickstarted economic recovery in poverty-stricken Bangladesh with privatisations but was killed in another military coup in 1981.\n\nThe BNP mantle fell to his widow, then a 35-year-old mother of two young sons who was dismissed by critics as a politically inexperienced housewife.\n\nZia led opposition to dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad, boycotting sham elections in 1986 and mounting street protests.\n\nShe and Hasina joined forces to push Ershad out in a wave of protests in 1990 and then faced off in Bangladesh's first free polls.Zia won and led from 1991-96, and again in 2001-2006, as she and Hasina alternated in power.\n\n- Mutual dislike -\n\nTheir mutual dislike was blamed for a January 2007 political crisis that prompted the military to impose emergency rule and set up a caretaker government.\n\nBoth were detained for more than a year.\n\nHasina won elections in December 2008 by a landslide and led uninterrupted until she fled to India in a helicopter on Monday.\n\nShe had tightened her grip on power by detaining tens of thousands of BNP members.\n\nHundreds also disappeared.Zia was convicted and jailed in 2018 on graft charges her party rejected as politically motivated.\n\nShe was later released into house arrest on condition she neither took part in politics nor went abroad for medical treatment.\n\nZia's first cabinet was hailed for liberalising Bangladesh's economy in the early 1990s, sparking decades of growth.\n\nHowever, her second term as the premier of an Islamist-allied coalition was marked by graft allegations against her government and sons.\n\nThere was also a series of Islamist attacks, one of which killed more than 20 people and almost claimed Hasina's life.\n\nThe anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion police unit Zia created has been accused of hundreds of extrajudicial killings.\n\nHer eldest son Tarique Rahman led the BNP from exile in London while she was in jail but he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life in prison over his alleged role in a bomb attack on a Hasina rally in 2004.\n\nThe BNP says the charges were a politically motivated attempt to expel Zia's dynasty from politics.Zia won respect for her resolute attitude, although her inability to compromise left her unable to cut deals with important allies at home or abroad.\n\nThat defiance extended even to the death of her youngest son from a heart attack in Malaysia in 2015.\n\nHasina went to her home to offer sympathy and condolences but Zia did not open the door.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng",

Hasina had trusted him because he was a distant relative.\n\n\"I give you my word that all the injustices will be addressed,\" the career infantry officer said, although it was not immediately clear if he would head the new government.\n\n\"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed - it is time to stop the violence.\"\n\nZaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead.\n\nHe called for a halt to \"all violence in the name of protest\" and promised that the new government would ensure justice for all the deaths that took place during the Anti-Discriminatory Student Movement, Bangladesh's Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nPresident Shahabuddin also ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, hours after Hasina was ousted and the military took power.\n\nThe president's press team said in a statement that a meeting led by Shahabuddin had \"decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately\".\n\n\"The meeting has also decided to free all the people who have been arrested during the student protests,\" the statement added. Bangladesh's military said it would lift a curfew imposed to quash protests at dawn on Tuesday.\n\n\"Offices, factories, schools, colleges ... will be open\" from 6am on Tuesday (0000 GMT), the military said in a statement. On Saturday, the army chief had told officers that the military \"always stood by the people\", according to an official statement.\n\nEarlier, the Bangladesh army had urged everyone to obey the curfew rules. \"The Bangladesh army will perform its promised duty in line with the Bangladesh constitution and existing laws of the country,\" it said in a statement late on Sunday.\n\n\"In this regard, the people are requested to abide by the curfew as well as give full cooperation to this end,\" it said, adding that the curfew was imposed to ensure the security of people's lives, properties, and important state establishments.\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nIndia's ANI news agency said Hasina, 76, landed at the Hindon Air Base, a military airfield near Delhi, after she had earlier today fled Bangladesh. Reuters could not immediately verify this, but commercial tracking services showed a Bangladesh Air Force plane leaving the country and flying west before it disappeared.\n\nCiting sources, ANI reported that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and senior military officers met Hasina at the airfield and she was being moved to a safe location. A top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nHasina had left the country for her own safety at the insistence of her family, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the BBC World Service. Hasina was \"so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her\", Joy said. She would not attempt to mount a political comeback, he said. He said she had transformed Bangladesh from a \"failing state\" to \"one of the rising tigers of Asia\". \"She's very disappointed,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "dataType":

Party spokesman A.K.M Wahiduzzaman told AFP Tuesday that she \"is now freed\".\n\nShe is in poor health, confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis and struggling with diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n- Decades-long feud -\n\nThe enmity between Zia and Hasina is known popularly in Bangladesh as the \"Battle of Begums\", with \"begum\" a Muslim honorific in South Asia for powerful women.\n\nTheir feud has its roots in the murder of Hasina's father -- the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- along with her mother, three brothers and several other relatives in a 1975 military coup.\n\nZia's husband Ziaur Rahman was then the deputy army chief and effectively took control himself three months later.\n\nHe kickstarted economic recovery in poverty-stricken Bangladesh with privatisations but was killed in another military coup in 1981.\n\nThe BNP mantle fell to his widow, then a 35-year-old mother of two young sons who was dismissed by critics as a politically inexperienced housewife.\n\nZia led opposition to dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad, boycotting sham elections in 1986 and mounting street protests.\n\nShe and Hasina joined forces to push Ershad out in a wave of protests in 1990 and then faced off in Bangladesh's first free polls.\n\nZia won and led from 1991-96, and again in 2001-2006, as she and Hasina alternated in power.\n\n- Mutual dislike -\n\nTheir mutual dislike was blamed for a January 2007 political crisis that prompted the military to impose emergency rule and set up a caretaker government. Both were detained for more than a year.\n\nHasina won elections in December 2008 by a landslide and led uninterrupted until she fled to India in a helicopter on Monday.\n\nShe had tightened her grip on power by detaining tens of thousands of BNP members. Hundreds also disappeared.\n\nZia was convicted and jailed in 2018 on graft charges her party rejected as politically motivated.\n\nShe was later released into house arrest on condition she neither took part in politics nor went abroad for medical treatment.\n\n- Son in exile -\n\nZia's first cabinet was hailed for liberalising Bangladesh's economy in the early 1990s, sparking decades of growth.\n\nHowever, her second term as the premier of an Islamist-allied coalition was marked by graft allegations against her government and sons.\n\nThere was also a series of Islamist attacks, one of which killed more than 20 people and almost claimed Hasina's life.\n\nThe anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion police unit Zia created has been accused of hundreds of extrajudicial killings.\n\nHer eldest son Tarique Rahman led the BNP from exile in London while she was in jail but he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life in prison over his alleged role in a bomb attack on a Hasina rally in 2004.\n\nThe BNP says the charges were a politically motivated attempt to expel Zia's dynasty from politics.\n\nZia won respect for her resolute attitude, although her inability to compromise left her unable to cut deals with important allies at home or abroad.\n\nThat defiance extended even to the death of her youngest son from a heart attack in Malaysia in 2015.\n\nHasina went to her home to offer sympathy and condolences but Zia did not open the door.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She and her sister Sheikh Rehana landed at Ghaziabad's Hindon Air Force Station in a C-130 transport aircraft. According to reports, Hasina is headed to the United Kingdom, where she is seeking political asylum, but may spend the night in Delhi before continuing her journey\n\nAccording to sources, Hasina may leave at 1 am for London on Tuesday where her sister, a UK citizen, will accompany her. The UK has been a refuge for many exiled political figures, including Tarique Rahman, son of former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. The UK government allows individuals to apply for asylum if they are unable to return to their country due to the risk of harm. Once granted, asylum provides safety from deportation.\n\nIn response to the crisis, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for swift action to restore democracy in Bangladesh. The situation has also prompted reactions from the Bangladeshi diaspora in London, with many celebrating Hasina's ouster as a second liberation for the country.\n\nHasina's arrival in India followed her request for safe passage through Indian airspace, which was immediately granted. She met with India's National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, upon arrival. Her departure from Bangladesh came just moments before protesters stormed her official residence in Dhaka. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security this evening to discuss the ongoing crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin has ordered the release of BNP chief and opposition leader Khaleda Zia from prison. The country has been engulfed in student protests for over a month, with more than 280 people killed in the unrest. The protests began in July over the job quota system and the situation rapidly deteriorated, forcing Hasina to flee. Demonstrators celebrated in Dhaka as news of her departure spread.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adan_khan@news9live.com",

History tells us that the leaders and party about to take control of Bangladesh have a blemished record, marred by their support for anti-India elements. One such leader might be returning to mainstream politics in Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced on Monday the release of jailed opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, hours after Sheikh Hasina resigned as the country's prime minister and fled Bangladesh. The decision to set the former Prime Minister free was taken after a meeting between the military and political parties of Bangladesh to form an interim government.\n\nKhaleda Zia, who is Sheikh Hasina's biggest rival, was imprisoned in 2018 after she was sentenced to 17 years in prison in a graft case. Her release from prison signifies the hold she continues to have over the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, of which she remains the chairman. It is believed that despite her ill health, Khaleda Zia will play a pivotal role in the interim government set to be formed.\n\nAlthough the BNP claims its leader was made the victim of a political witch hunt, there is no denying that Begum Khaleda Zia has been a troublesome leader when it comes to handling Indian interests in Bangladesh. It is well known that she, along with her son Tarique Rehman Zia ran a corrupt government in the early 2000s. Tarique and his younger brother even ran an extortion racket and a parallel government during Khaleda Zia's prime ministership.\n\nFor India, the return of Khaleda Zia to mainstream Bangladeshi politics is not a positive sign of times to come. It was during Zia's rule, first from 1991 to 1996, and then from 2002 to 2006 that insurgencies in Northeast India surged.\n\nIn fact, Zia's Home Minister is in jail for arranging arms and ammunition from Pakistan for ULFA - arguably the strongest insurgent group of the Northeast back in the day. It is an open secret that during her rule, Bangladesh worked in close coordination with Pakistan to subvert Indian interests and create a terror-conducive environment for jihadis.\n\nShockingly, in 1997, Khaleda Zia openly announced the BNP's support for insurgent groups in Northeast India, claiming that they were fighting a war of independence. She said: \"They (the northeastern insurgents) are fighting for independence. We also fought for it, so we are always in favour of any independence movement.\"\n\nZia added that the use of Bangladesh's army will not be allowed against Northeastern insurgent groups. Interestingly, when Sheikh Hasina took over, she became a key partner in India's fight against militancy, and provided great assistance in cracking down on insurgents operating against India from Bangladeshi soil.\n\nIn many ways, Khaleda Zia's rule facilitated the mushrooming of an anti-India narrative in Bangladesh, so much so that ordinary Bangladeshis began growing hostile to New Delhi over what they thought was interference in their internal politics. This crevice has only grown larger in the years gone by. Today, the BNP and Jamaat inherit a Bangladesh where India is viewed as an overpowering entity. Especially popular is the narrative that Muslims are now unsafe in India.\n\nHistorically, the BNP has used an anti-India plank to reap electoral dividends. It is not a surprise that the BNP's latest attempt has been at spearheading the \"India Out\" campaign in Bangladesh, as part of which influencers have been urging people to boycott India economically.\n\nFor India, the events that have unfolded in Bangladesh represent a strategic setback - a significant one at that. CNN-News18 has reported how Pakistan's ISI was neck-deep in ensuring Sheikh Hasina's ouster from power. Sources have said ISI sleeper cells were working full time in Dhaka to dislodge Hasina. It is understood that Pakistan, which is tacitly supported by China, wants an anti-India regime in charge of Bangladesh so that it can activate a new front against New Delhi in the East.\n\nRead More: ISI Conspiracy to Remove Sheikh Hasina as Pakistan Wants Anti-India Govt in Bangladesh: Top Intel Sources\n\nThe rise of BNP and the ultra-radical Jamaat-e-Islami poses significant challenges for India. For starters, both these parties - aided by Pakistan and other foreign powers - could make an anti-India stance their main plank here on. It needs to be remembered that the BNP has failed to win elections in Bangladesh for many years. As such, it will need a pan-national agenda to unite its supporters and capitalise on the political vacuum that has emerged in the country.\n\nThere are also apprehensions that Northeast India could face the brunt of an anti-India regime taking control of Bangladesh. Pakistan and China have a lot of interest in reviving the dormant insurgencies of Northeast India. Previously, during BNP rule, several insurgents were provided safe harbour and weapons in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Sheikh Hasina administration was instrumental in curbing insurgent activities and fostering a cooperative relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi. The rise of the BNP, coupled with the influence of ISI-backed Jamaat-e-Islami, threatens to reverse these gains and destabilise the region. The potential for increased insurgent activity and the involvement of external actors like Pakistan and China necessitates a strategic response from New Delhi.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com",

Joy's comments came hours after Hasina, Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, resigned and fled the country following widespread protests.\n\nHasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's 'Father of the Nation,' who is credited with leading the country to freedom from Pakistan in 1971. Rahman was Bangladesh's first president.\n\nHasina's 15-year rule culminated after weeks of violent protests against her government. Twenty-four years ago, Hasina was part of a similar uprising on the streets of Bangladesh, demanding the return of democracy in the country.\n\nErshad founded the Jatiya Party in 1986. Bangladesh saw the first elections since the 1982 coup. But Jatiya Party won a majority, and General Ershad remained president until 1990 when the country witnessed a mass pro-democracy uprising.\n\nPopularly known as '90's Anti-Authoritarian Movement, the 1990 mass uprising was a protest movement that eventually led to the fall of General Ershad. The protests started in October 1990 and ran through December 1990. About a hundred people died during the protests.\n\nFuture Bangladesh Prime Ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina were also part of the uprising.\n\nThe declaration outlined the process for handing over General Ershad's presidency to a civil government. A caretaker government would take over before holding a free and fair election within 90 days of its arrival to power, the political parties demanded.\n\nOn December 6, 1980, General Ershad submitted his resignation, accepting the demands of the parties. General Ershad was eventually arrested on corruption charges.\n\nThe BNP formed a government with the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami, and Khaleda Zia was sworn in as Bangladesh's first woman prime minister.\n\nIn the subsequent years, Zia and Hasina became political rivals. In fact, hours after Hasina's ouster, Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia.\n\nAs it turns out after Hasina resigned and fled the country on August 5, many reports, including one in BBC, referred to her as 'the pro-democracy icon who became an autocrat.'", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gulam_jeelani@livemint.com", "name": "Gulam Jeelani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Muhammad_Ershad", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hussain Muhammad Ershad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatiya_Party_(Ershad)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jatiya Party (Ershad)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Father of the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Mass_Uprising_in_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/05/600x338/BANGLADESH-PROTESTS-USA-0_1722876467011_1722876506272.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792434", "eventUri": "eng-9792434", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 275, "textEnd": 283, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-10-", "textStart": 1365, "textEnd": 1377}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-12-", "textStart": 1394, "textEnd": 1407}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Khaleda took over the BNP from her husband Ziaur Rahman, killed in 1981.\n\nTheir feud, known as the \"Battle of the Begums\" using the South Asian honorific for a woman of high rank, has loomed over Bangladeshi politics for decades.\n\nSince Hasina emerged victorious in 2009, Khaleda had faced an array of criminal charges and jail, receding from public life and leaving her exiled eldest son in charge as acting leader of her political movement.\n\nBorn on Aug. 15, 1945, she now has liver disease, diabetes and heart problems, according to her doctors.\n\nPopularly known by her first name, Khaleda was widely seen as a shy wife and devoted mother until her husband was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.\n\nPlunging into politics, she became head of her husband's conservative BNP three years later, vowing to deliver on his aim of \"liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness\".\n\nShe and Hasina joined hands to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad from power in 1990. But political rivalry embittered the relationship, fuelling a feud ever since.\n\nIn 1991 Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of Islamic political allies.\n\nIn doing so, she became Bangladesh's first female prime minister, only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto.\n\nShe replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary form of government so that power rested with the prime minister, lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.\n\nShe lost to Hasina in a 1996 election, then returned to power in another election five years later. Her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.\n\nIn 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed, and years later Khaleda's eldest son was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP contended the charges were trumped up.\n\nAlthough Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.\n\nThe interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.\n\nAlthough the BNP boycotted the 2008 election and Khaleda never regained power, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.\n\nTension between their two parties has often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding economic development for a poverty-stricken country of nearly 170 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.\n\nIn 2018, Khaleda, her eldest son, exiled since 2008, and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.\n\nShe was jailed but released into house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.

Mass protests on Monday led to Hasina fleeing the country after her resignation as country's PM.\n\nAfter Hasina's emergency departure, the army chief announced the formation of an interim government.Moreover, orders were given to free prominent political prisoners, including Zia.\n\nZia, 78, had been serving a 17-year prison sentence for graft since 2018 during Hasina's administration. A.K.M Wahiduzzaman, a spokesman for Zia's party, the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), stated on Tuesday, \"She is now freed.\" Zia is reportedly in poor health, suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and cirrhosis of the liver, and uses a wheelchair.\n\nThe political rivalry between Zia and Hasina, known as the \"battle of begums,\" has shaped Bangladesh's political landscape for decades. Their enmity can be traced back to the assassination of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh, in a 1975 military coup. Several other family members were also killed.\n\nZia's husband, Ziaur Rahman, was the deputy army chief at that time and took control of the government three months later. He initiated economic reforms in the impoverished country but was himself assassinated in a military coup in 1981.\n\nAlthough initially dismissed as a politically inexperienced housewife, Zia became the leader of the BNP and opposed the dictatorship of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. She spearheaded protests and boycotted elections in 1986, eventually joining forces with Hasina to oust Ershad in 1990.\n\nThe subsequent years saw Zia and Hasina alternate in power, with Zia serving as Prime Minister from 1991-1996 and again from 2001-2006.\n\nTheir mutual contempt was evident during a political crisis in January 2007, which led to the imposition of emergency rule by the military and the establishment of a caretaker government. Both leaders were detained for more than a year. Hasina returned to power in 2008, winning a landslide victory, and remained in power until her recent flight to India.\n\nHasina's tenure was marked by a crackdown on BNP members, with tens of thousands detained and many disappearing. Zia's 2018 conviction on graft charges was dismissed by her party as politically motivated. She was released into house arrest under the condition that she neither participate in politics nor seek medical treatment abroad.\n\nZia's first term as prime minister was credited with liberalising Bangladesh's economy in the early 1990s, leading to decades of economic growth. However, her second term was spoiled by corruption allegations against her administration and sons, as well as a series of Islamist attacks, one of which nearly killed Hasina.\n\nDuring her imprisonment, her eldest son, Tarique Rahman, led the BNP from exile in London. He was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life imprisonment for his alleged involvement in a 2004 bomb attack on a Hasina rally, charges the BNP claims were politically motivated to remove Zia's influence from politics.\n\nZia gained respect for her unwavering resolve, though her unwillingness to compromise often hindered her ability to form crucial alliances domestically and internationally.\n\nEven in personal tragedy, such as the death of her youngest son from a heart attack in Malaysia in 2015, Zia's defiance was evident. Hasina visited Zia's home to extend her condolences, but Zia did not open the door.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

While the US welcomed the creation of an interim administration in Bangladesh, the UK called for a United Nations probe into the incidents in Bangladesh over the past few weeks.\n\n\"It is not yet certain how many days Sheikh Hasina would remain in India, where she has lived once earlier in exile,\" said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.\n\nEarlier in the day, a statement from the Bangladesh president's office said that following President Shahabuddin's meeting with the heads of the three armed forces, leaders of various political parties, representatives of civil society and leaders of the Students Against Discrimination movement, the national parliament has been dissolved. It added that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had been released.\n\nThe statement also said that the process of releasing those detained in the student movement and various cases from July 1 to August 5 had begun, with many already being freed.\n\nThe student movement against the Hasina regime had erupted against a quota of up to 30% in government jobs for family members of veterans from Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nSome reports said that Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus had accepted the role to head the interim government. However, the interim administration had yet to take shape, even as several names of economists and former army generals as members were doing the rounds.\n\nHarsh V Shringla, India's former high commissioner to Dhaka, told ET that the interim government should be completely neutral and should comprise technocrats.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, curfew was lifted and offices and educational institutions reopened, though attendance was sparse. Flight operations also resumed at Dhaka airport.\n\nBangladesh Police Subordinate Employees Association announced an indefinite strike for the sake of their security. Since the fall of the Awami League government, the policemen are in fear as police stations across Bangladesh have been targeted. Hundreds of police stations and police establishments witnessed vandalism and arson attacks in various districts of the country, including Dhaka, on Monday, when police headquarters were also set on fire after the fall of the government.\n\nSince Hasina's resignation, there have been incidents of ambushes on policemen, murders of policemen, vandalism and arson, according to the statement issued by the association. About 450 police stations were attacked in the country and countless policemen killed in incidents linked with terrorist activities, it said.\n\nAs violence raged in Bangladesh, the statue replicating Greek goddess Themes and the mural titled 'Smriti Chiranjib' inside the Supreme Court premises were vandalised, as was the mural titled 'Smriti Chiranjib', commemorating the country's \"founding father\" Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The attackers also broke the door of the office of the Supreme Court Bar Association as well as the plaque bearing Sheikh Hasina's name.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType":

The outing of its prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, on Monday, August 5, gave rise to as many fears as it does hopes. Never before had a prime minister of this country stayed in power for so many years. Yet, after 15 years of increasingly autocratic rule, the \"Iron Lady\" was forced to flee, under pressure from the crowds on the streets. At 2:25 pm, she hastily boarded an army helicopter, without even having time to record a final message to the nation, as she would have liked. She landed at a military base near New Delhi. While India has, so far, been one of her main supporters, Indian media have claimed that she would only be passing through on her way to the UK.\n\nSince early July, Bangladesh has been rocked by a student movement demanding the abolition of a quota system for recruitment to civil service jobs. The country's young people took to the streets to demand equal opportunities and were brutally repressed. Over 300 people died in three weeks, including children. Many of the victims were shot at point-blank range. Faced with the carnage and the criminal contempt of Bangladesh's leader, the people's anger swelled and events picked up speed on Monday.\n\nA new page must now be turned. On Monday afternoon, the army announced that it would form an interim government, confirming Hasina's resignation. \"It is time to stop the violence,\" said General Waker-uz-Zaman, the Chief of Army Staff, in a national address broadcast on state television. The outline of this future government remains unclear, but should take shape over the coming hours. Will the army, which has a long history of coups d'\u00e9tat, be in charge? What role will the opposition parties play? Above all, how will the leaders of the student movement that brought down the government fit into the picture?\n\nThe president, Mohammed Shahabuddin (a member of the same party as Hasina), General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the heads of the naval and air forces and the leaders of several opposition parties - including Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, which had been banned a few days earlier - met on Monday, without the presence of the student movement.\n\nTheir meeting resulted in a series of decisions, including releasing all people arrested during the student protests, as well as former prime minister Khaleda Zia. At 78, Zia, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and a major rival of Hasina, has been hospitalized since receiving a 17-year prison sentence for corruption in 2018. Parliament will be dissolved and a national government formed as soon as possible, leading to new elections, the president promised. The army also announced that curfews would be lifted and that \"offices, factories, schools, college\" and shops would reopen from 6 am on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waker-uz-Zaman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waker-uz-Zaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/08/05/515/0/6720/3360/1440/720/60/0/2ef3544_1722876353125-073188.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792434", "eventUri": "eng-9792434", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 108, "textEnd": 116}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

After the meeting, he told the media that the formation of an interim government had been decided and would take effect shortly after discussions with the president.\n\nIn a press briefing after the meeting, the army chief said justice would be ensured for all killings and injustices.\n\n\"Keep trust in the army,\" he said, calling on everyone to shun the path of violence and return home, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nThe army chief also mentioned that he would soon meet with representatives of students and teachers.\n\nHe expressed confidence that the situation would return to normal soon and sought all-out cooperation from people of all classes and professions, including students, regardless of party affiliations and opinions.\n\nMeanwhile, an ongoing curfew will be in effect from Monday midnight until 6am on Tuesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate has said.\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, all government, semi-government, autonomous, semi-autonomous, private institutions, factories, schools, colleges, madrasas, universities and all educational institutions in Bangladesh will remain open, a press release of the army's media wing said.\n\nOn Sunday, the government imposed a curfew for an indefinite period from 6pm in Dhaka and other divisional cities, district towns and all city corporations, amid nationwide unrest.\n\nIn a related move, coordinator of the Students Against Discrimination movement, Md Nahid Islam, has announced that an outline for an interim government will be formulated within the next 24 hours.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Tejgaon, Dhaka, on Monday night, Nahid dedicated the uprising that had led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government to martyred students and the general public.\n\nOther coordinators of the movement were also present at the event.\n\nNahid said they needed to sit with everyone to formulate the outline.\n\n\"We will discuss it with all the coordination committees, civil society, and political and state stakeholders. However, we will inform you later exactly whom we will meet with. But within the next 24 hours, a complete outline of the interim government will be provided.\"\n\nThe state structure through which fascism had been created must be dismantled, Nahid said, adding: \"We declare those who have been killed in the uprising as national heroes.\"\n\nNahid continued: \"If the army chief declares a state of emergency and forms a government, we will not accept that either.\"\n\nBNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman has called for a free, fair and impartial general election at the earliest, noting the moment when Sheikh Hasina was forced to leave the country after resigning from her premiership following a mass uprising as 'historic'.\n\nTarique made the call in a video message addressing the nation on social media on Monday.\n\nEarlier, after news came that Hasina has resigned and fled to India, thousands of demonstrators moved to her official residence Ganobhabhan, in Dhaka. The demonstrators ransacked her residence, and helped themselves to furniture and other things in her residence.\n\nWidespread celebrations also broke out in the streets following her resignation.\n\nThere were reports of police buildings set on fire while a statue of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina's father and the founder of Bangladesh, was vandalised\n\nIn a televised address, the head of the army Gen Waker-uz-Zaman said an interim government will be formed. Gen Zaman did not say who would head it.\n\nThe previous day, the country reported at least 96 deaths in police firings due to clashes between Awami League members and protesters.\n\nUNI RN",

Palak has been barred from leaving the country by the airport authorities. The Awami League leader had gone to the Dhaka airport to flee to Delhi, but was not permitted to board the plane and was taken into custody during immigration, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nThe decision to dissolve the parliament was taken following the president's discussions with chiefs of three staff of armed forces, leaders of different political parties, representatives of civil society and leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, the Daily Star newspaper reported, citing a statement issued by the president's office.\n\nIt also stated that the BNP Chairperson and former premier Khaleda Zia was freed from house arrest. Zia was freed a day after her arch-rival Hasina fled Bangladesh. Shortly after the former PM's resignation, President Shahabuddin issued Zia's release order.\n\nZia had been under house arrest after being released from jail during the pandemic.

New Bangladesh may be run by allies of Pakistan and China | Mint", "body": "Sheikh Hasina's flight to India is not surprising given the longstanding alliance between her and Delhi. India has been a crucial supporter throughout her tenure. This relationship has contributed to rising anti-India sentiment within Bangladesh, especially as Hasina's popularity waned.\n\nBangladesh is in the throes of the Army and an interim government, fifteen years after the Sheikh Hasina regime stormed to power. The Bangladesh Awami League leader resigned on Monday, August 5, and fled to India. Hasina's resignation was announced by Bangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman. The Army chief also informed that he had invited political parties to form the interim government.\n\nHours later, the Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered that jailed Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Khaleda Zia be freed. The move triggered speculations on whether the BNP would form the interim government in Bangladesh.\n\nIf BNP comes to power, it might spell doom for PM Narendra Modi-led Indian subcontinent, already surrounded by anti-India neighbours.\n\nSheikh Hasina's flight to India is not surprising given the longstanding alliance between her and Bangladesh's powerful neighbour. India has been a crucial supporter throughout her tenure.\n\nThis relationship has contributed to rising anti-India sentiment within Bangladesh, especially as Hasina's popularity waned.\n\nA major concern for India was militant groups hostile to India operating in Bangladesh. In addition, Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a record-breaking ten meetings in 2023.\n\nDelhi has to decide whether to continue backing its increasingly unpopular ally and risk alienating the public and hurting relations with Bangladesh over the long run.\n\nHasina's resignation has now resolved this issue.\n\nIndia's security strategy faces a significant setback with Bangladesh's shifting political landscape. Surrounded by neighbouring countries with strained relations -- Pakistan and China -- losing Bangladesh as an ally is a considerable blow.\n\nFundamentalists are set to take over Bangladesh with help from benefactors in Pakistan and China. Now friends of India's two adversarial countries - Pakistan and China - have scored a victory in Bangladesh as well: the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of Opposition leader Khaleda Zia, and Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nIndia may find itself sandwiched between Pakistan and a possibly hostile Bangladesh if Khaleda Zia were to take over as head of that country. This change may make India's regional influence and strategic positioning more difficult.\n\nIndia would lose control of the Bay of Bengal if relations with Bangladesh were to deteriorate under a probable Khaleda Zia regime.\n\nThe Bay of Bengal is a strategically positioned region that spans the Indian Ocean Region from Africa to Indonesia. It is a vital part of the area that lies between Bangladesh, Myanmar, and India. This region is vital due to its proximity to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world's key maritime chokepoints that links the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea.\n\nBangladesh is crucial for India to connect its geographically isolated north-eastern states with the Bay of Bengal. There are five Indian states that share their boundary with Bangladesh - West Bengal, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Assam.\n\nThere are reports that Pakistan may have helped the Jamaat and its student branch by supporting their activities, giving them briefings on their tactics, and providing safety during Hasina's forces' crackdowns, according to Firstpost.\n\nAccording to the article, Pakistan may want to stage elections in order to support a BNP-led government that is pro-Pakistan and gain international credibility.\n\nAfghanistan fell to the Taliban, while Sri Lanka's stance with India remains uncertain, with a Chinese vessel docking ban set to end soon.\n\nNepal has also been shifting towards China. Whispers of change have been emanating from Bhutan too.\n\nWith Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister, India has lost one of its most dependable allies in a region increasingly influenced by anti-Indian sentiment and Chinese interests.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

their relatives, as some of those missing were released.\n\n\"We need answers,\" said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning \"The Call of the Mothers\", a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasina's security forces.\n\nRights groups accused Hasina's security forces of abducting and disappearing some 600 people - including many from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party.\n\nMs Tulee told AFP that at least 20 families gathered outside a military intelligence force building in a northern Dhaka neighbourhood, waiting for news of their relatives.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced on Aug 5 that Hasina had resigned after weeks of deadly protests, and the military would form a caretaker government.\n\nHours later, President Mohammed Shahabuddin - after a meeting with the army chief - said it had been decided to free all those arrested during the student protests, as well as key opposition leader Khaleda Zia.\n\nEx-prime minister Zia, 78, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is in poor health and was largely under house arrest after being sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018.\n\nAmong the most high profile of those released on Aug 6 was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, son of Mir Quasem Ali, the executed leader of Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\n\"He was released from secret detention this morning,\" family friend and relative Masum Khalili told AFP. \"He had a medical check-up, his condition is stable.\"\n\nQuasem, a British-educated barrister, was abducted - allegedly by security forces in plainclothes - in August 2016.\n\nSecurity forces during Hasina's rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters.\n\nHuman Rights Watch in 2023 said security forces had committed \"over 600 enforced disappearances\" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits

Negotiations on composition of the interim administration had continued through the day.\n\nThe law-and-order situation deteriorated, with attacks on minorities and Indian assets, including the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre in Dhaka, according to people familiar with the matter. The police, facing wrath of protesters -- dozens of whom were reportedly killed in firing in recent weeks -- issued an apology and declared an indefinite strike.\n\nMeanwhile, India remained in touch with the Bangladesh military establishment. External affairs minister S Jaishankar briefed Parliament and an all-party meeting on the evolving situation in the neighbouring country.\n\nOusted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, who arrived in Delhi on Monday, remained in India amid reports that the United States had revoked her visa and the UK refused her asylum. While the US welcomed the creation of an interim administration in Bangladesh, the UK called for a United Nations probe into the incidents in Bangladesh over the past few weeks.\n\n\"It is not yet certain how many days Sheikh Hasina would remain in India, where she has lived once earlier in exile,\" said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.\n\nEarlier in the day, a statement from the Bangladesh president's office said that following President Shahabuddin's meeting with the heads of the three armed forces, leaders of various political parties, representatives of civil society and leaders of the Students Against Discrimination movement, the national parliament has been dissolved. It added that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had been released.\n\nThe statement also said that the process of releasing those detained in the student movement and various cases from July 1 to August 5 had begun, with many already being freed.\n\nThe student movement against the Hasina regime had erupted against a quota of up to 30% in government jobs for family members of veterans from Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nHarsh V Shringla, India's former high commissioner to Dhaka, told ET that the interim government should be completely neutral and should comprise technocrats.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, curfew was lifted and offices and educational institutions reopened, though attendance was sparse. Flight operations also resumed at Dhaka airport.\n\nBangladesh Police Subordinate Employees Association announced an indefinite strike for the sake of their security. Since the fall of the Awami League government, the policemen are in fear as police stations across Bangladesh have been targeted. Hundreds of police stations and police establishments witnessed vandalism and arson attacks in various districts of the country, including Dhaka, on Monday, when police headquarters were also set on fire after the fall of the government.\n\nSince Hasina's resignation, there have been incidents of ambushes on policemen, murders of policemen, vandalism and arson, according to the statement issued by the association. About 450 police stations were attacked in the country and countless policemen killed in incidents linked with terrorist activities, it said.\n\nAs violence raged in Bangladesh, the statue replicating Greek goddess Themes and the mural titled 'Smriti Chiranjib' inside the Supreme Court premises were vandalised, as was the mural titled 'Smriti Chiranjib', commemorating the country's \"founding father\" Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The attackers also broke the door of the office of the Supreme Court Bar Association as well as the plaque bearing Sheikh Hasina's name.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

She has largely remained away from politics for many years.\n\nPopularly known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.\n\nPlunging into politics, she became head of her husband's conservative BNP three years later, vowing to deliver on his aim of \"liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness\".\n\nShe joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad from power in 1990.\n\nBut their cooperation did not last long and the next year, Bangladesh held what has hailed as its first free election with Khaleda winning a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of Islamic political allies.\n\nIn doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh's first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto.\n\nKhaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary form of government so that power rested with the prime minister, lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.\n\nShe lost to Hasina in the 1996 elections but came back five years later. But her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.\n\nIn 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed and years later her eldest son was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP contended the charges were trumped up.\n\nAlthough Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.\n\nThe interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.\n\nAlthough the BNP boycotted the 2008 election and Khaleda never regained power, the vitriolic feud with Hasina that led to the two being dubbed \"the battling Begums\" continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.\n\nTension between their two parties has often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding economic development for a poverty-stricken country of nearly 170 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.\n\nIn 2018, Khaleda, her eldest son and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.\n\nShe was jailed but released in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. She has remained under house arrest since then.\n\n(Editing by Krishna N.

Hundreds of them were granted bail on Tuesday.\n\nKhaleda Zia, the main opposition leader and head of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is also set to be released. The 78-year-old and twice the prime minister of Bangladesh was sentenced to 17 years in prison for corruption in 2018.\n\nThe party was banned from politics for a second time on Aug. 1 over allegations that it carried out violence during the student protests over quotas in government jobs.\n\nIt was first banned in 1972 by Mujibur Rehman and was also barred from contesting elections in 2013.\n\nJamaat has been a key ally of the main opposition BNP since the 2001 national election.\n\nAt least six of the top Jamaat leaders were also hanged for crimes against humanity in the 1971 liberation war during Hasina's tenure.\n\nArmy chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said a transitional government would be formed and the deaths in the course of the weeks-long protests would be investigated.\n\nOrganizers of the student protests have said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus should head the government.\n\nAround 400 people were killed in weeks of protests.

released.\n\n\"We need answers,\" said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning \"The Call of the Mothers\", a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasina's security forces.\n\nRights groups accused Hasina's security forces of abducting and disappearing some 600 people -- including many from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party.\n\nTulee told AFP that at least 20 families gathered outside a military intelligence force building in a northern Dhaka neighbourhood, waiting for news of their relatives.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Monday that Hasina had resigned after weeks of deadly protests, and the military would form a caretaker government.\n\nHours later President Mohammed Shahabuddin -- after a meeting with the army chief -- said it had been decided to free all those arrested during the student protests, as well as key opposition leader Khaleda

British-educated barrister, was abducted -- allegedly by security forces in plainclothes -- in August 2016.\n\nSecurity forces during Hasina's rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters.\n\nHuman Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed \"over 600 enforced disappearances\" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for.\n\nHasina's government denied the allegations of disappearances and extrajudicial killings, saying

This is a prelude to the formation of an interim government.\n\nBegum Khaleda Zia, 78, former prime minister and opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP) chairperson and several other opposition leaders, who were kept under house arrest by Sheikh Hasina, were released. Ahmad bin Qasim, son of Jamaat-e-Islami leader Mirqasim Ali, who was hanged in 2016, lawyer and prominent BNP leader Ahmed bin Qasim was also released.\n\nThe anti-discrimination student movement, which issued an ultimatum to dissolve parliament before three o'clock today, also demanded that Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus lead the interim government. Yunus assured the students that he would lead the government as chief adviser. He is in Paris for the Olympics.\n\nIn a video message, student leaders Nahid Islam, Asif Muhammad and Abubakar Masumdar stated that they will not accept a government led or supported by the military and that a government should be formed as per their suggestion. Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman interacted with student leaders. He announced that he was taking over the administration and would form an interim government.\n\nSino-Pak conspiracy in London and Saudi\n\nLONDON: It is reported that there is a conspiracy in London and Saudi Arabia with the connivance of Pakistan and China to overthrow the government of Sheikh Hasina and bring the pro-Chinese BNP to power. It is said that it is this conspiracy that ignited the anti-reservation movement. It also includes months of planning by Jamaat-e-Islami. The agitation was funded by Chinese agencies operating in Pakistan.\n\nBangladeshi intelligence sources say that Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh National Party leaders, Khaleda's son Tariq Rehman and ISI officials held talks in Saudi Arabia. More than 500 posts against Hasina were circulated through anti-Bangladesh X accounts to fuel the agitation. Many accounts were from Pakistan. Protests against reservation escalated into a riot in which 300 people were killed. Chhatrashibir, the student wing of the anti-India Jamaat-e-Islami, ignited the agitation. The aim of Jamaat-e-Islami was to turn the student agitation into a political movement. Most of the videos circulating against Hasina were created through Khaleda's BNP accounts.

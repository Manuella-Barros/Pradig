In the entertainment world, Justin Chang took home a Pulitzer for criticism, across fields, for his work as a film critic at the Los Angeles Times, where he worked for nearly eight years. He left earlier this year to join the New Yorker. The prizes also come with a $15,000 award in most categories.\n\nChang was honored \"for richly evocative and genre-spanning film criticism that reflects on the contemporary moviegoing experience,\" according to the Pulitzer Prize Board. Chang is also a critic for NPR's \"Fresh Air.\" He also previously worked at Variety, where he began as an intern before rising to become the publication's chief film critic.\n\nHe beat out fellow finalists Zadie Smith for her \"T\u00e1r\" review in The New York Review of Books, as well as Vinson Cunningham, nominated for her theater reviews for The New Yorker.\n\nA special citation was also awarded to the late writer and hip-hop critic Greg Tate, who wrote for The Village Voice and other publications. He died in 2021.\n\nThe Pulitzer Board praised his \"language -- cribbed from literature, academia, popular culture and hip-hop,\" adding that it \"was as influential as the content of his ideas. His aesthetic, innovations and intellectual originality, particularly in his pioneering hip-hop criticism, continue to influence subsequent generations, especially writers and critics of color.\"\n\nThe other special citation was given to journalists and media covering the war in Gaza. They have awarded other citations in recent years to journalists covering wars in Ukraine and Afghanistan.\n\n\"Under horrific conditions, an extraordinary number of journalists have died in the effort to tell the stories of Palestinians and others in Gaza. This war has also claimed the lives of poets and writers among the casualties. As the Pulitzer Prizes honor categories of journalism, arts, and letters, we mark the loss of invaluable records of the human experience,\" the Board wrote.\n\nThe New York Times' staff won its own International Reporting Pulitzer for its coverage of Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, failures of Israeli intelligence and coverage of what it described as \"the Israeli military's sweeping, deadly response in Gaza.\" The Reuters staff won a Breaking News Photography Pulitzer for its coverage of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas and Israel's subsequent response.\n\nAmong other notable awards this year, ProPublica won the Public Service Pulitzer for its coverage of the Supreme Court and the influence of billionaires providing justices with gifts and travel. One of the National Reporting prizes went to the staff of Reuters for its series of stories examining Elon Musk and his car and aerospace businesses, which the Board noted led to probes of his companies both domestically and in Europe. The other National Reporting prize went to the Washington Post for its examination of the AR-15 assault rifle.\n\nRead the full list of this year's Pulitzer Prize winners below.

Pulitzer Prize administrator Marjorie Miller, v-p and global enterprise editor at the Associated Press, led the ceremony, which was livestreamed on YouTube.\n\nJayne Anne Phillips won in the fiction category for her novel Night Watch (Knopf). The two other finalists in fiction included Yiyun Li, for Wednesday's Child (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), and Ed Park, for Same Bed, Different Dreams (Random House).\n\nNathan Thrall won the general nonfiction award for A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy (Metropolitan Books). The other nominees in general nonfiction were John Valliant, for Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World (Knopf), and Siddharth Kara, for Cobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives (St. Martin's).\n\nOther literary winners included Jacqueline Jones, in the history category, for No Right to an Honest Living: The Struggles of Boston's Black Workers in the Civil Rights Era (Basic Books). The finalists were Michael Willrich, for American Anarchy: The Epic Struggle Between Immigrant Radicals and the US Government at the Dawn of the Twentieth Century (Basic Books), and Elliott West, for Continental Reckoning: The American West in the Age of Expansion (University of Nebraska Press).\n\nA dual award in biography to both Jonathan Eig's King: A Life (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) and Ilyon Woo's Master Slave Husband Wife: An Epic Journey from Slavery to Freedom (Simon & Schuster); Tracy Daugherty was named a finalist for Larry McMurtry: A Life (St. Martin's Press).\n\nCristina Rivera Garza, in the category of memoir and autobiography, won for Liliana's Invisible Summer: A Sister's Search for Justice (Hogarth). The finalists were Jonathan Rosen, for The Best Minds: A Story of Friendship, Madness, and the Tragedy of Good Intentions (Penguin Press), and Andrew Leland, for The Country of the Blind: A Memoir at the End of Sight (Penguin Press).\n\nBrandon Som's Tripas: Poems (Georgia Review Books) won the in the poetry category, the finalists for which were Robyn Shiff, for The Information Desk: An Epic (Penguin Books), and Jorie Graham, for To 2040 (Copper Canyon Press). Eboni Booth won in drama for Primary Trust; the finalists were Mois\u00e9s Kaufman and Amanda Gronich, for Here There Are Blueberries, and Shayok Misha Chowdhury, for Public Obscenities.\n\nPulitzer Prizes are awarded in 23 categories, and nominated finalists are not announced in advance. In 22 of the categories, winners receive a $15,000 cash award and a certificate. In the Public Service category, a news organization receives a gold medal. This year's Public Service winner was ProPublica, for the work of Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski, and Kirsten Berg on \"Friends of the Court,\" a series on ethical questions and the conduct of U.S. Supreme Court justices.\n\nTwo special citations were awarded this year as well, one honoring the late writer and Black cultural critic Greg Tate, and the other honoring \"the journalists covering Gaza.\" On the latter, Miller said in her remarks, \"The board recognizes the courageous work of journalists and media workers covering the war in Gaza. Under horrific conditions, an extraordinary number of journalists have died in the effort to tell the stories of Palestinians and aid workers in Gaza. This war also has claimed the lives of poets and writers among the casualties. As the Pulitzer Prizes honor categories of journalism, arts, and letters, we mark the loss of invaluable records of the human experience.\"\n\nAlso during the prize announcements, Pulitzer board co-chair Neil Brown warned that \"journalism is under threat. On college campuses, in state capitals and at local school boards, journalists are locked out in order to thwart their independent reporting.\" Brown also called for the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, imprisoned in Russia since March 2023. \"When we bestowed these awards last May, the Pulitzer board condemned [his] unlawful detention,\" Brown said. \"Here we are, a year later, and Evan is still a prisoner. This is outrageous, and the Pulitzer board renews the call to free Evan. Free him now.\"\n\nMiller and Brown's references to journalists under threat alluded to a challenging year at Columbia University, which administers the Pulitzer Prizes. Tensions remain high after a semester of protest, counter-protest, and police action at Columbia, related to the war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian students set up an encampment on the university's South Lawn and, on April 30, were evicted by New York City Police, in a night marked by numerous arrests and accusations of the suppression of student journalists. On the same day as the prize announcements, Columbia canceled its main graduation ceremony, which ordinarily takes place on the South Lawn.\n\nOn May 1, the day after the NYPD's actions at the encampment and nearby Hamilton Hall, which protesters had occupied, the Pulitzer Prize Board released a statement to honor student journalists across the U.S. and at Columbia specifically. \"As we gather to consider the nation's finest and most courageous journalism, the Pulitzer Prize Board would like to recognize the tireless efforts of student journalists across our nation's college campuses, who are covering protests and unrest in the face of great personal and academic risk,\" the board wrote. \"We would also like to acknowledge the extraordinary real-time reporting of student journalists at Columbia University, where the Pulitzer Prizes are housed, as the New York Police Department was called onto campus on Tuesday night [April 30]. In the spirit of press freedom, these students worked to document a major national news event under difficult and dangerous circumstances and at risk of arrest.\"\n\nIn October, the Pulitzer Prize awards ceremony is slated to be held in Low Memorial Library, across West 116th Street from the South Lawn and Hamilton Hall, the epicenter of the student protest.", "source": {"uri": "publishersweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PublishersWeekly.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Thrall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Thrall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayne_Anne_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayne Anne Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Day in the Life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epic Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_A._Knopf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alfred A.

The staff of the paper shared the award for National Reporting with Reuters. Contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prisoner in Russia, won for his columns criticizing Vladimir Putin. David E. Hoffman won for Editorial Writing.\n\nReuters also won for Breaking News Photography.\n\nThe staff of The New York Times won for International Reporting for its coverage of the Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing war. Hannah Drier at the Times won for Investigative Reporting for an unrelated series of stories about migrant child labor. Katie Englehart, a contributing writer at the Times, won for Feature Writing.\n\n\"A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy,\" by Nathan Thrall won the Prize for General Nonfiction.

Since the newswire published the images, it faced accusations from a pro-Israel media advocacy group that its photography staff had advance knowledge of the attacks, a charge the company has denied.\n\nThe Pulitzer jury did not mention the controversy in its citation, which praised Reuters for \"raw and urgent photographs documenting the October 7th deadly attack in Israel by Hamas and the first weeks of Israel's devastating assault on Gaza.\"\n\nStaff at the Times won the Pulitzer for international reporting for a series of reports on the attacks and Israel's retaliation in Gaza, including work focusing on the intelligence failures of Israel's military and the ways in which its government had propped up Hamas for years, as well as its strategy of bombing areas where it had instructed Gazan civilians to flee.\n\nThe Pulitzer jury did not cite \"Screams Without Words,\" a controversial Times report about rapes allegedly committed by Hamas on Oct. 7, in its comments. Published in December, the story has drawn criticism from pro-Palestinian media outlets that questioned the Times' sources and from survivors and family members who said the paper's characterization of what happened to people they knew was not true. The criticism led to a high-profile newsroom leak of internal debate over the piece and also has helped fuel some denials that Hamas committed rape during the attacks.\n\nWhile Thrall's book predates the Oct. 7 attack, his book tour was conducted in its shadow and has been a frequent magnet for controversy. Some tour stops canceled planned talks by Thrall, saying they would be \"insensitive\" in the midst of Israel's war, in a sign of how the broader arts and culture landscape has been divided over Israel since the attacks. After the book's publication, a local Jewish federation protested Thrall's plan to teach a Bard course on whether Israel's treatment of Palestinians could be considered apartheid.\n\nAt least one media outlet also canceled a planned sponsorship by his publisher, while Thrall himself turned down a speaking engagement at the University of Arkansas after the school, in accordance with state law, required him to sign a pledge promising not to boycott Israel. Thrall is currently in Berlin, where he said the Open Society Foundation, funded by progressive Jewish megadonor George Soros, paid to distribute free copies of his book.\n\nElsewhere in the awards, the Pulitzer committee honored Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian Jewish dissident, with the prize for commentary. Kara-Murza, who has accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for treason and won the Pulitzer from his cell.\n\n\"Here There Are Blueberries,\" a play by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman and Amanda Gronich that draws on real Nazi photographs of Auschwitz acquired by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial and Museum, was a finalist in the drama category but did not win. The show premiered at San Diego's La Jolla Playhouse in 2022 and is currently playing at the New York Theatre Workshop. And in the memoir category, Jewish author Andrew Leland's \"The Country of the Blind: A Memoir at the End of Sight\" was also a finalist.\n\nThe Pulitzers are overseen by the journalism school at Columbia University, which has been at the epicenter of a nationwide campus pro-Palestinian encampment movement and which canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony earlier on Monday in the wake of the protests.

Widely recognized as the most prestigious awards in their field within the United States, the 108th Pulitzer Prizes took place against an unusually fraught backdrop. In a statement last week, the Pulitzer Board commended student journalists covering campus protests against the war in Gaza, acknowledging they were often placing themselves \"in the face of great personal and academic risk.\"\n\nTwenty-three prizes were awarded last year, with cash prizes of $15,000 going to the recipients of most of the prizes and a gold medal to the news organization that wins the Public Service Prize.\n\nThe New York Times won one of its three Pulitzers this year for its coverage of the war in Gaza. The award for International Reporting went to its staff for \"wide-ranging and revelatory coverage of Hamas' lethal attack in southern Israel on October 7, Israel's intelligence failures and the Israeli military's sweeping, deadly response in Gaza.\" The Times also took Pulitzers in the Features and Investigative categories, the latter for a series by Hannah Dreier that revealed \"the stunning reach of migrant child labor across the United States - and the corporate and governmental failures that perpetuate it.\"\n\nThe Washington Post tied with the Times with three wins in the categories of Commentary, Editorial Writing and National Reporting. It shared the last with the staff at Reuters, which also won a Pulitzer for Breaking News Photography, for \"raw and urgent photographs documenting the October 7th deadly attack in Israel by Hamas and the first weeks of Israel's devastating assault on Gaza.\"\n\nRead more: https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1248897860/pulitzer-prize-winners-2024", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_International_Reporting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dreier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dreier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Editorial_Writing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_National_Reporting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards_and_Bestsellers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards and Bestsellers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Visual_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Visual Arts", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544070", "eventUri": "eng-9544070", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1014, "textEnd": 1023, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 452726807, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 10, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 10}}}
